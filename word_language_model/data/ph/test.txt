And Selfhood turned into a slave
 To work in Mammon's cave,
    Fair Lady?
Will Truth's long blade ne'er gleam again?
Hath Giant Trade in dungeons slain
All great contempts of mean-got gain
 And hates of inward stain,
    Fair Lady?
For aye shall name and fame be sold,
And place be hugged for the sake of gold,
And smirch-robed Justice feebly scold
 At Crime all money-bold,
    Fair Lady?
Shall self-wrapt husbands aye forget
Kiss-pardons for the daily fret
Wherewith sweet wifely eyes are wet --
 Blind to lips kiss-wise set --
    Fair Lady?
Shall lovers higgle, heart for heart,
Till wooing grows a trading mart
Where much for little, and all for part,
 Make love a cheapening art,
    Fair Lady?
Shall woman scorch for a single sin
That her betrayer may revel in,
And she be burnt, and he but grin
 When that the flames begin,
    Fair Lady?
Shall ne'er prevail the woman's plea,
`We maids would far, far whiter be
If that our eyes might sometimes see
 Men maids in purity,'
    Fair Lady?
Shall Trade aye salve his conscience-aches
With jibes at Chivalry's old mistakes --
The wars that o'erhot knighthood makes
    Fair Lady?
Now by each knight that e'er hath prayed
To fight like a man and love like a maid,
Since Pembroke's life, as Pembroke's blade,
 I' the scabbard, death, was laid,
    Fair Lady,
I dare avouch my faith is bright
Nor time hath changed His hair to white,
 Nor His dear love to spite,
    Fair Lady.
I doubt no doubts:  I strive, and shrive my clay,
And fight my fight in the patient modern way
For true love and for thee -- ah me! and pray
 To be thy knight until my dying day,
    Fair Lady

"
Made end that knightly horn, and spurred away
Into the thick of the melodious fray.



And then the hautboy played and smiled,
And sang like any large-eyed child,
Cool-hearted and all undefiled.
   "Huge Trade!" he said,
"Would thou wouldst lift me on thy head
And run where'er my finger led!
Once said a Man -- and wise was He --
`Never shalt thou the heavens see,
Save as a little child thou be.'"
Then o'er sea-lashings of commingling tunes
The ancient wise bassoons,
   Like weird
   Gray-beard
Old harpers sitting on the high sea-dunes,
   Chanted runes:
"Bright-waved gain, gray-waved loss,
The sea of all doth lash and toss,
One wave forward and one across:
But now 'twas trough, now 'tis crest,
And worst doth foam and flash to best,
   And curst to blest.


Life! Life! thou sea-fugue, writ from east to west,
   Love, Love alone can pore
   On thy dissolving score
   Of harsh half-phrasings,
    Blotted ere writ,
   And double erasings
    Of chords most fit.
Yea, Love, sole music-master blest,
May read thy weltering palimpsest.
To follow Time's dying melodies through,
And never to lose the old in the new,
And ever to solve the discords true --
   Love alone can do.
And ever Love hears the poor-folks' crying,
And ever Love hears the women's sighing,
And ever sweet knighthood's death-defying,
And ever wise childhood's deep implying,
But never a trader's glozing and lying.



And yet shall Love himself be heard,
Though long deferred, though long deferred:
O'er the modern waste a dove hath whirred:
Music is Love in search of a word


"rains fall
and a bird chirps

the rain stops
and the world is silent

clouds drift from one
mountain to another

sun creates a shadow
on the hills 

a wild deer runs towards
the forest

a flock of black crows
hover on a tree of berries

grass spread gently
a  cow grazes upon it

up there a jet slices the sky
perhaps wanting to cut it

this is the place 
where i can hear my self

tomorrow i shall leave 
carrying with me fullness. 


He spread the red roses petals in his bed
He lit the candles
He placed two wine glasses by the bedside 
He Switched on the radio-the music was soothing 
The fragrance -inviting
The mood for the evening was set

He had rehearsed the entire week
On one Knee he was to go a second time

The Mood became tantalizing
He rehearsed more and more the lyrics
He was sure her weight could not break his back
He would carry her to where the petals lay waiting
The hour of the princess arrival came 
He could  smell her fragrance from a distance

The rehearsed moves seemed elusive at this hour of need
His well rehearsed lyrics, sweet words deserted his tongue
He cooed and whimpered like a baby 
He went down on the wrong knee
He held the diamond ring in the wrong hand
He developed some goosebumps

The husky voice of the nurse shouted. . 

Next patient please
That is how his day dream ended-Back to work



Said the Table to the Chair,
'You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat,
And from chilblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk,
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!'
Said the Table to the Chair.

Said the Chair unto the Table,
'Now you know we are not able!
How foolishly you talk,
When you know we cannot walk!'
Said the Table with a sigh,
'It can do no harm to try;
I've as many legs as you;
Why can't we walk on two?'

So they both went slowly down,
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound,
As they toddled round and round.
And everybody cried,
As they hastened to their side,
'See! the Table and the Chair
Have come out to take the air!'

But, in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley,
They completely lost their way,
And wandered all the day
Till, to see them safely back,
They paid a Ducky-quack,
And a Beetle, and a Mouse,
Who took them to their house.

Then they whispered to each other,
'O delightful little brother!
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!'
So the Ducky and the leetle
Browny-Mousy and the Beetle
Dined, and danced upon their heads
Till they toddled to their beds. 


when we are chatting i am also chatting with a man
from taiwan
who claims he also knows the games of life
what games
he says anything from love to weddings to baptisms
except

(and he does not want to mention this) 

but i tell him, and ask him, 

death. 



The bud of a smile opens and looks up outward
To bloom on many a face often masked! 
It`s the ill fate of the face of every man
That lies in the seed of a smile not explicit, 
Often sowed on the dry land of indifference! 
It`s the catastrophe one knows not.

A president living in a castle with a hundred chambers
Smiles and retreats into a slumber prone cave, 
A prime minister sitting in a broken armchair
Speaks and profusely sweats
They both come back and smile for a while! 
It`s the catastrophe one sees around.

Men clad in white, red and saffron  
Bark at one another and go for punching one another
And later they all smile in solace at one another
And every eye sees it for a while.
It`s a season dying for another soon.
It`s the catastrophe one often misses to feel.

An army of delights and dismay marches in
And across the barricades of past and present it goes.
A herd of cattle is first led to some worn out grassland
Only to squeal from a slaughter house later. 
The onset of a winter merciless is all around.
It`s the catastrophe one sees not.

A man and a dog walk together with a wolf following
And the man deserts the dog to tame the wolf.
The onlookers smile at both and clap for a while
And a season changes and we all hear next
The dog growling from near the corpse and the carcass! 
It`s the catastrophe one knows not

Belinda lived in a little white house, 
With a little black kitten and a little gray mouse, 
And a little yellow dog and a little red wagon, 
And a realio, trulio, little pet dragon. 

Now the name of the little black kitten was Ink, 
And the little gray mouse, she called her Blink, 
And the little yellow dog was sharp as Mustard, 
But the dragon was a coward, and she called him Custard. 

Custard the dragon had big sharp teeth, 
And spikes on top of him and scales underneath, 
Mouth like a fireplace, chimney for a nose, 
And realio, trulio, daggers on his toes. 

Belinda was as brave as a barrel full of bears, 
And Ink and Blink chased lions down the stairs, 
Mustard was as brave as a tiger in a rage, 
But Custard cried for a nice safe cage. 

Belinda tickled him, she tickled him unmerciful, 
Ink, Blink and Mustard, they rudely called him Percival, 
They all sat laughing in the little red wagon 
At the realio, trulio, cowardly dragon. 

Belinda giggled till she shook the house, 
And Blink said Week! , which is giggling for a mouse, 
Ink and Mustard rudely asked his age, 
When Custard cried for a nice safe cage. 

Suddenly, suddenly they heard a nasty sound, 
And Mustard growled, and they all looked around. 
Meowch! cried Ink, and Ooh! cried Belinda, 
For there was a pirate, climbing in the winda. 

Pistol in his left hand, pistol in his right, 
And he held in his teeth a cutlass bright, 
His beard was black, one leg was wood; 
It was clear that the pirate meant no good. 

Belinda paled, and she cried, Help! Help! 
But Mustard fled with a terrified yelp, 
Ink trickled down to the bottom of the household, 
And little mouse Blink strategically mouseholed. 

But up jumped Custard, snorting like an engine, 
Clashed his tail like irons in a dungeon, 
With a clatter and a clank and a jangling squirm 
He went at the pirate like a robin at a worm. 

The pirate gaped at Belinda's dragon, 
And gulped some grog from his pocket flagon, 
He fired two bullets but they didn't hit, 
And Custard gobbled him, every bit. 

Belinda embraced him, Mustard licked him, 
No one mourned for his pirate victim 
Ink and Blink in glee did gyrate 
Around the dragon that ate the pyrate. 

But presently up spoke little dog Mustard,
I'd been twice as brave if I hadn't been flustered.
And up spoke Ink and up spoke Blink,
We'd have been three times as brave, we think,
And Custard said, I quite agree
That everybody is braver than me.

Belinda still lives in her little white house, 
With her little black kitten and her little gray mouse, 
And her little yellow dog and her little red wagon, 
And her realio, trulio, little pet dragon. 

Belinda is as brave as a barrel full of bears, 
And Ink and Blink chase lions down the stairs, 
Mustard is as brave as a tiger in a rage, 
But Custard keeps crying for a nice safe cage. 


O love! Thou are not for me
My bleeding heart shall not hold thee
Thou made a home, in lonely dreams
A bird, in search of mountains and hills
O love! What did thou give me? 
Ephemeral joy, filled with shadows
Scattered grains floating in the water
I held thee close to my chest
Thou stabbed me in the back
My verses lose rhyme, by thy grace
A splash of ink fills the yellow page
Adrift on the fickleness of wind




Listen, nephew. 
When I opened the cantina 
At noon 
A triangle of sunlight 
Was stretched out 
On the floor 
Like a rug 
Like a tired cat. 
It flared in 
From the window 
Through a small hole 
Shaped like a yawn. 
Strange I thought 
And placed my hand 
Before the opening, 
But the sunlight 
Did not vanish. 
I pulled back 
The shutters 
And the room glowed, 
But this pyramid 
Of whiteness 
Was simply brighter. 
The sunlight around it 
Appeared soiled 
Like the bed sheet 
Of a borracho. 
Amazed, I locked the door, 
Closed the windows. 
Workers, in from 
The fields, knocked 
To be let in, 
Children peeked 
Through the shutters, 
But I remained silent. 
I poured a beer, 
At a table 
Shuffled a pack 
Of old cards, 
And watched it 
Cross the floor, 
Hang on the wall 
Like a portrait 
Like a calendar 
Without numbers. 
When a fly settled 
In the sunlight 
And disappeared 
In a wreath of smoke, 
I tapped it with the broom, 
Spat on it. 
The broom vanished. 
The spit sizzled. 
It is the truth, little one. 
I stood eye to blank eye 
And by misfortune 
This finger 
This pink stump 
Entered the sunlight, 
Snapped off 
With a dry sneeze, 
And fell to the floor 
As a gift 
To the ants 
Who know me 
For what I gave. 


Now I want to talk, and need to say, a few strong words to you, 
But I will tell you right away, that there's one thing you won't do, 
You won't start to walk away from me, before you've heard me out, 
I'll try and keep my voice real calm, and not begin to shout.

You've driven me mad with all the ways, you disappear, which brings
Me to the boil, when you're always off to one of your mad flings, 
It isn't fair when I need to speak, and you are never here, 
It really is no fun not knowing, when you will reappear.

So just sit down and listen, to what I have to say, 
It will only take a minute, and certainly not all day, 
I have to get this off my chest, or else I will explode, 
And I don't want to hear you 'giggle', or come up with another load

Of excuses, why you can't sit down and give me your attention, 
 I know that escaping from me, is always your intention, 
But now I'm going to tell you, this is now my chance, Okay, 
Oh, No! After all that I've forgotten, what I was going to say


Once more the gate behind me falls; 
      Once more before my face 
I see the moulder'd Abbey-walls, 
      That stand within the chace. 

Beyond the lodge the city lies, 
      Beneath its drift of smoke; 
And ah! with what delighted eyes 
      I turn to yonder oak. 

For when my passion first began, 
      Ere that, which in me burn'd, 
The love, that makes me thrice a man, 
      Could hope itself return'd; 

To yonder oak within the field 
      I spoke without restraint, 
And with a larger faith appeal'd 
      Than Papist unto Saint. 

For oft I talk'd with him apart 
      And told him of my choice, 
Until he plagiarized a heart, 
      And answer'd with a voice. 

Tho' what he whisper'd under Heaven 
      None else could understand; 
I found him garrulously given, 
      A babbler in the land. 

But since I heard him make reply 
      Is many a weary hour; 
'Twere well to question him, and try 
      If yet he keeps the power. 

Hail, hidden to the knees in fern, 
      Broad Oak of Sumner-chace, 
Whose topmost branches can discern 
      The roofs of Sumner-place! 

Say thou, whereon I carved her name, 
      If ever maid or spouse, 
As fair as my Olivia, came 
      To rest beneath thy boughs.--- 

"O Walter, I have shelter'd here 
      Whatever maiden grace 
The good old Summers, year by year 
      Made ripe in Sumner-chace: 

"Old Summers, when the monk was fat, 
      And, issuing shorn and sleek, 
Would twist his girdle tight, and pat 
      The girls upon the cheek, 

"Ere yet, in scorn of Peter's-pence, 
      And number'd bead, and shrift, 
Bluff Harry broke into the spence 
      And turn'd the cowls adrift: 

"And I have seen some score of those 
      Fresh faces that would thrive 
When his man-minded offset rose 
      To chase the deer at five; 

"And all that from the town would stroll, 
      Till that wild wind made work 
In which the gloomy brewer's soul 
      Went by me, like a stork: 

"The slight she-slips of royal blood, 
      And others, passing praise, 
Straight-laced, but all-too-full in bud 
      For puritanic stays: 

"And I have shadow'd many a group 
      Of beauties, that were born 
In teacup-times of hood and hoop, 
      Or while the patch was worn; 

"And, leg and arm with love-knots gay 
      About me leap'd and laugh'd 
The modish Cupid of the day, 
      And shrill'd his tinsel shaft. 

"I swear (and else may insects prick 
      Each leaf into a gall) 
This girl, for whom your heart is sick, 
      Is three times worth them all. 

"For those and theirs, by Nature's law, 
      Have faded long ago; 
But in these latter springs I saw 
      Your own Olivia blow, 

"From when she gamboll'd on the greens 
      A baby-germ, to when 
The maiden blossoms of her teens 
      Could number five from ten. 

"I swear, by leaf, and wind, and rain, 
      (And hear me with thine ears,) 
That, tho' I circle in the grain 
      Five hundred rings of years--- 

"Yet, since I first could cast a shade, 
      Did never creature pass 
So slightly, musically made, 
      So light upon the grass: 

"For as to fairies, that will flit 
      To make the greensward fresh, 
I hold them exquisitely knit, 
      But far too spare of flesh
 


Oh, hide thy knotted knees in fern, 
      And overlook the chace; 
And from thy topmost branch discern 
      The roofs of Sumner-place. 

But thou, whereon I carved her name, 
      That oft hast heard my vows, 
Declare when last Olivia came 
      To sport beneath thy boughs. 

"O yesterday, you know, the fair 
      Was holden at the town; 
Her father left his good arm-chair, 
      And rode his hunter down. 

"And with him Albert came on his. 
      I look'd at him with joy: 
As cowslip unto oxlip is, 
      So seems she to the boy. 

"An hour had past---and, sitting straight 
      Within the low-wheel'd chaise, 
Her mother trundled to the gate 
      Behind the dappled grays. 

"But as for her, she stay'd at home, 
      And on the roof she went, 
And down the way you use to come, 
      She look'd with discontent. 

"She left the novel half-uncut 
      Upon the rosewood shelf; 
She left the new piano shut: 
      She could not please herseif 

"Then ran she, gamesome as the colt, 
      And livelier than a lark 
She sent her voice thro' all the holt 
      Before her, and the park. 

"A light wind chased her on the wing, 
      And in the chase grew wild, 
As close as might be would he cling 
      About the darling child: 

"But light as any wind that blows 
      So fleetly did she stir, 
The flower, she touch'd on, dipt and rose, 
      And turn'd to look at her. 

"And here she came, and round me play'd, 
      And sang to me the whole 
Of those three stanzas that you made 
      About my Ôgiant bole;' 

"And in a fit of frolic mirth 
      She strove to span my waist: 
Alas, I was so broad of girth, 
      I could not be embraced. 

"I wish'd myself the fair young beech 
      That here beside me stands, 
That round me, clasping each in each, 
      She might have lock'd her hands. 

"Yet seem'd the pressure thrice as sweet 
      As woodbine's fragile hold, 
Or when I feel about my feet 
      The berried briony fold
 


O muffle round thy knees with fern, 
      And shadow Sumner-chace! 
Long may thy topmost branch discern 
      The roofs of Sumner-place! 

But tell me, did she read the name 
      I carved with many vows 
When last with throbbing heart I came 
      To rest beneath thy boughs? 

"O yes, she wander'd round and round 
      These knotted knees of mine, 
And found, and kiss'd the name she found, 
      And sweetly murmur'd thine. 

"A teardrop trembled from its source, 
      And down my surface crept. 
My sense of touch is something coarse, 
      But I believe she wept. 

"Then flush'd her cheek with rosy light, 
      She glanced across the plain; 
But not a creature was in sight: 
      She kiss'd me once again. 

"Her kisses were so close and kind, 
      That, trust me on my word, 
Hard wood I am, and wrinkled rind, 
      But yet my sap was stirr'd: 

"And even into my inmost ring 
      A pleasure I discern'd, 
Like those blind motions of the Spring, 
      That show the year is turn'd. 

"Thrice-happy he that may caress 
      The ringlet's waving balm--- 
The cushions of whose touch may press 
      The maiden's tender palm. 

"I, rooted here among the groves 
      But languidly adjust 
My vapid vegetable loves 
      With anthers and with dust: 

"For ah! my friend, the days were brief 
      Whereof the poets talk, 
When that, which breathes within the leaf, 
      Could slip its bark and walk. 

"But could I, as in times foregone, 
      From spray, and branch, and stem, 
Have suck'd and gather'd into one 
      The life that spreads in them, 

"She had not found me so remiss; 
      But lightly issuing thro', 
I would have paid her kiss for kiss, 
      With usury thereto
 


O flourish high, with leafy towers, 
      And overlook the lea, 
Pursue thy loves among the bowers 
      But leave thou mine to me. 

O flourish, hidden deep in fern, 
      Old oak, I love thee well; 
A thousand thanks for what I learn 
      And what remains to tell. 

" ÔTis little more: the day was warm; 
      At last, tired out with play, 
She sank her head upon her arm 
      And at my feet she lay. 

"Her eyelids dropp'd their silken eaves 
I breathed upon her eyes 
Thro' all the summer of my leaves 
      A welcome mix'd with sighs. 

"I took the swarming sound of life--- 
      The music from the town--- 
The murmurs of the drum and fife 
      And lull'd them in my own. 

"Sometimes I let a sunbeam slip, 
      To light her shaded eye; 
A second flutter'd round her lip 
      Like a golden butterfly; 

"A third would glimmer on her neck 
      To make the necklace shine; 
Another slid, a sunny fleck, 
      From head to ankle fine, 

"Then close and dark my arms I spread, 
      And shadow'd all her rest--- 
Dropt dews upon her golden head, 
      An acorn in her breast. 

"But in a pet she started up, 
      And pluck'd it out, and drew 
My little oakling from the cup, 
      And flung him in the dew. 

"And yet it was a graceful gift--- 
      I felt a pang within 
As when I see the woodman lift 
      His axe to slay my kin. 

"I shook him down because he was 
      The finest on the tree. 
He lies beside thee on the grass. 
      O kiss him once for me. 

"O kiss him twice and thrice for me, 
      That have no lips to kiss, 
For never yet was oak on lea 
      Shall grow so fair as this.' 

Step deeper yet in herb and fern, 
      Look further thro' the chace, 
Spread upward till thy boughs discern 
      The front of Sumner-place. 

This fruit of thine by Love is blest, 
      That but a moment lay 
Where fairer fruit of Love may rest 
      Some happy future day. 

I kiss it twice, I kiss it thrice, 
      The warmth it thence shall win 
To riper life may magnetise 
      The baby-oak within. 

But thou, while kingdoms overset, 
      Or lapse from hand to hand, 
Thy leaf shall never fail, nor yet 
      Thine acorn in the land. 

May never saw dismember thee, 
      Nor wielded axe disjoint, 
That art the fairest-spoken tree 
      From here to Lizard-point. 

O rock upon thy towery-top 
      All throats that gurgle sweet! 
All starry culmination drop 
      Balm-dews to bathe thy feet! 

All grass of silky feather grow--- 
      And while he sinks or swells 
The full south-breeze around thee blow 
      The sound of minster bells. 

The fat earth feed thy branchy root, 
      That under deeply strikes! 
The northern morning o'er thee shoot, 
      High up, in silver spikes! 

Nor ever lightning char thy grain, 
      But, rolling as in sleep, 
Low thunders bring the mellow rain, 
      That makes thee broad and deep! 

And hear me swear a solemn oath, 
      That only by thy side 
Will I to Olive plight my troth, 
      And gain her for my bride. 

And when my marriage morn may fall, 
      She, Dryad-like, shall wear 
Alternate leaf and acorn-ball 
      In wreath about her hair. 

And I will work in prose and rhyme, 
      And praise thee more in both 
Than bard has honour'd beech or lime, 
      Or that Thessalian growth, 

In which the swarthy ringdove sat, 
      And mystic sentence spoke; 
And more than England honours that, 
      Thy famous brother-oak, 

Wherein the younger Charles abode 
      Till all the paths were dim, 
And far below the Roundhead rode, 
      And humm'd a surly hymn. 


We move by means of our mud bumps.
We bubble as do the dead but more slowly.

The products of excruciating purges
we are squeezed out thin hard and dry.

If we exude a stench it is petrified sainthood.
Our feet are large crude fused together

solid like anvils. Ugly as truth is ugly
we are meant to stand upright a long time

and shudder without motion
under the scintillating pins of light

that dart between our bodies
of pimpled mud and your eyes. 


You lie
on your back

I lie
on my belly

I
tongue-tied

between your
thighs.

Your feet
planted firmly

on each of 
my shoulders

you now
at the tip

of my tongue

crying 
wordless
words

standing 
on my shoulders

peeping
over

the tall
wall

of Infinity

telling me
how beautiful

it
is. 


I have not heard
The melody of morning birds
This entire summer season-
I’m sure they still sing
Delicately at dawn, 
But my thoughts are deafening: 
I think of your tears
And how we walked away
From each other on a fateful day
Of anger and jealousy, 
A day of harsh words
And damnable recriminations! 

When you feel hurt
To the empty core of your being, 
Forgiveness is impossible
And the loneliness 
Is the taste of death. 

Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silv'ry Tay!
Alas! I am very sorry to say
That ninety lives have been taken away
On the last Sabbath day of 
Which will be remember'd for a very long time.

'Twas about seven o'clock at night,
And the wind it blew with all its might,
And the rain came pouring down,
And the dark clouds seemed to frown,
And the Demon of the air seem'd to say --
"I'll blow down the Bridge of Tay


When the train left Edinburgh
The passengers' hearts were light and felt no sorrow,
But Boreas blew a terrific gale,
Which made their hearts for to quail,
And many of the passengers with fear did say --


But when the train came near to Wormit Bay,
Boreas he did loud and angry bray,
And shook the central girders of the Bridge of Tay
On the last Sabbath day of 
Which will be remember'd for a very long time.

So the train sped on with all its might,
And Bonnie Dundee soon hove in sight,
And the passengers' hearts felt light,
Thinking they would enjoy themselves on the New Year,
With their friends at home they lov'd most dear,
And wish them all a happy New Year.

So the train mov'd slowly along the Bridge of Tay,
Until it was about midway,
Then the central girders with a crash gave way,
And down went the train and passengers into the Tay!
The Storm Fiend did loudly bray,
Because ninety lives had been taken away,
On the last Sabbath day of 
Which will be remember'd for a very long time.

As soon as the catastrophe came to be known
The alarm from mouth to mouth was blown,
And the cry rang out all o'er the town,
Good heavens! the Tay Bridge is blown down,
And a passenger train from Edinburgh,
Which fill'd all the people's hearts with sorrow,
And made them all for to turn pale,
Because none of the passengers were sav'd to tell the tale
How the disaster happen'd on the last Sabbath day of 
Which will be remember'd for a very long time.

It must have been an awful sight,
To witness in the dusky moonlight,
While the Storm Fiend did laugh, and angry did bray,
Along the Railway Bridge of the Silv'ry Tay.
Oh! ill-fated Bridge of the Silv'ry Tay,
I must now conclude my lay
By telling the world fearlessly without least dismay,
That your central girders would not have given way,
At least many sensible men do say,
Had they been supported on each side with buttresses,
At least many sensible men confesses,
For the stronger we our houses do build,
The less chance we have of being killed. 


From his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect
saints, as well as certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of
his birth, had been stirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of
his answers.

And when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood
he kissed them, and left them and went out into the world, that he
incomplete knowledge of Him, or worshipped the false gods who dwell
in groves and have no care of their worshippers.

And he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking without
sandals, as he had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his girdle
a leathern wallet and a little water-bottle of burnt clay.

And as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that
which there were many cities.

And he passed through eleven cities. And some of these cities were
in valleys, and others were by the banks of great rivers, and
others were set on hills. And in each city he found a disciple who
loved him and followed him, and a great multitude also of people
whole land, and many of the rulers were converted, and the priests
of the temples in which there were idols found that half of their
gain was gone, and when they beat upon their drums at noon none, or
but a few, came with peacocks and with offerings of flesh as had
been the custom of the land before his coming.

Yet the more the people followed him, and the greater the number of
his disciples, the greater became his sorrow. And he knew not why
given to him.

And one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was a
city of Armenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of people
followed after him; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on
a rock that was on the mountain, and his disciples stood round him,
and the multitude knelt in the valley.

And he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his Soul,
'Why is it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and that each of my
disciples is an enemy that walks in the noonday?' And his Soul
of Himself, and thou hast given this knowledge away to others. The
pearl of great price thou hast divided, and the vesture without
seam thou hast parted asunder. He who giveth away wisdom robbeth
himself. He is as one who giveth his treasure to a robber. Is not

And he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to him,
faith was leaving him by reason of the number of those who believed
in him.

giveth away wisdom robbeth himself.'

And after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and
bowed themselves to the ground and said, 'Master, talk to us about
thee hath this knowledge.'

And he answered them and said, 'I will talk to you about all other
talk to you. Neither now, nor at any time, will I talk to you

And they were wroth with him and said to him, 'Thou hast led us
into the desert that we might hearken to thee. Wilt thou send us
away hungry, and the great multitude that thou hast made to follow
thee?'



And the multitude murmured against him and said to him, 'Thou hast
led us into the desert, and hast given us no food to eat. Talk to

But he answered them not a word. For he knew that if he spake to

And his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of people
returned to their own homes. And many died on the way.

And when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon, and
journeyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making any
answer. And when the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert
which is the desert of the Great River. And having found a cavern
in which a Centaur had once dwelt, he took it for his place of
dwelling, and made himself a mat of reeds on which to lie, and
suffered him to keep some knowledge of Him and of His wonderful
greatness.

Now, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern in
which he had made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man of
evil and beautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with
empty hands. Every evening with empty hands the young man passed
by, and every morning he returned with his hands full of purple and
pearls. For he was a Robber and robbed the caravans of the
merchants.

And the Hermit looked at him and pitied him. But he spake not a
word. For he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith.

And one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full of
purple and pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon
the sand, and said to the Hermit: 'Why do you look at me ever in
this manner as I pass by? What is it that I see in your eyes? For
no man has looked at me before in this manner. And the thing is a
thorn and a trouble to me.'

And the Hermit answered him and said, 'What you see in my eyes is
pity. Pity is what looks out at you from my eyes.'

And the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit in a
bitter voice, and said to him, 'I have purple and pearls in my
hands, and you have but a mat of reeds on which to lie. What pity
should you have for me? And for what reason have you this pity?'

'I have pity for you,' said the Hermit, 'because you have no

and he came close to the mouth of the cavern.

'It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the
world,' answered the Hermit.

'And have you got it?' said the young Robber, and he came closer
still.

'Once, indeed,' answered the Hermit, 'I possessed the perfect
divided it amongst others. Yet even now is such knowledge as
remains to me more precious than purple or pearls.'

And when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple and
the pearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a sharp
sword of curved steel he said to the Hermit, 'Give me, forthwith
Wherefore should I not slay him who has a treasure greater than my
treasure?'

And the Hermit spread out his arms and said, 'Were it not better
to live in the world and have no knowledge of Him? Slay me if that

And the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the Hermit
young Robber rose up and said to the Hermit, 'Be it as you will.
As for myself, I will go to the City of the Seven Sins, that is but
three days' journey from this place, and for my purple they will
give me pleasure, and for my pearls they will sell me joy.' And he
took up the purple and the pearls and went swiftly away.

And the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought him. For
the space of three days he followed the young Robber on the road
and entreated him to return, nor to enter into the City of the
Seven Sins.

And ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit and
which is more precious than purple and pearls? If you will give me
that, I will not enter the city.'

And ever did the Hermit answer, 'All things that I have I will give
thee, save that one thing only. For that thing it is not lawful
for me to give away.'

And in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great
scarlet gates of the City of the Seven Sins. And from the city
there came the sound of much laughter.

And the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at the
gate. And as he did so the Hermit ran forward and caught him by
the skirts of his raiment, and said to him: 'Stretch forth your
hands, and set your arms around my neck, and put your ear close to
my lips, and I will give you what remains to me of the knowledge of

upon the ground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him the
city and the young Robber, so that he saw them no more.

And as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was standing
beside him; and He who was standing beside him had feet of brass
and hair like fine wool. And He raised the Hermit up, and said to
weeping?' And he kissed him. 


THE room is quiet, thoughts alone 
People its mute tranquillity; 
The yoke put on, the long task done,­ 
I am, as it is bliss to be, 
Still and untroubled. Now, I see, 
For the first time, how soft the day 
O'er waveless water, stirless tree, 
Silent and sunny, wings its way. 
Now, as I watch that distant hill, 
So faint, so blue, so far removed, 
Sweet dreams of home my heart may fill, 
That home where I am known and loved: 
It lies beyond; yon azure brow 
Parts me from all Earth holds for me; 
And, morn and eve, my yearnings flow 
Thitherward tending, changelessly. 
My happiest hours, aye ! all the time, 
I love to keep in memory, 
Lapsed among moors, ere life's first prime 
Decayed to dark anxiety. 

Sometimes, I think a narrow heart
Makes me thus mourn those far away, 
And keeps my love so far apart 
From friends and friendships of to-day; 
Sometimes, I think 'tis but a dream 
I measure up so jealously, 
All the sweet thoughts I live on seem 
To vanish into vacancy: 
And then, this strange, coarse world around 
Seems all that's palpable and true; 
And every sight, and every sound, 
Combines my spirit to subdue 
To aching grief, so void and lone 
Is Life and Earth­so worse than vain, 
The hopes that, in my own heart sown, 
And cherished by such sun and rain 
As Joy and transient Sorrow shed, 
Have ripened to a harvest there: 
Alas ! methinks I hear it said, 
'Thy golden sheaves are empty air.' 
All fades away; my very home 
I think will soon be desolate; 
I hear, at times, a warning come
Of bitter partings at its gate; 
And, if I should return and see 
The hearth-fire quenched, the vacant chair; 
And hear it whispered mournfully, 
That farewells have been spoken there, 
What shall I do, and whither turn ? 
Where look for peace ? When cease to mourn ? 


'Tis not the air I wished to play,
  The strain I wished to sing;
My wilful spirit slipped away
  And struck another string.
I neither wanted smile nor tear,
  Bright joy nor bitter woe,
But just a song that sweet and clear,
  Though haply sad, might flow. 

A quiet song, to solace me
  When sleep refused to come;
A strain to chase despondency,
  When sorrowful for home.
In vain I try; I cannot sing;
  All feels so cold and dead;
No wild distress, no gushing spring
  Of tears in anguish shed; 

But all the impatient gloom of one
  Who waits a distant day,
When, some great task of suffering done,
  Repose shall toil repay.
For youth departs, and pleasure flies,
  And life consumes away,
And youth's rejoicing ardour dies
  Beneath this drear delay; 

And Patience, weary with her yoke,
  Is yielding to despair,
And Health's elastic spring is broke 
  Beneath the strain of care. 
Life will be gone ere I have lived;
  Where now is Life's first prime ?
I've worked and studied, longed and grieved,
  Through all that rosy time. 

To toil, to think, to long, to grieve,­
  Is such my future fate ?
The morn was dreary, must the eve
  Be also desolate ?
Well, such a life at least makes Death
  A welcome, wished-for friend;
Then, aid me, Reason, Patience, Faith,
  To suffer to the end 

When Friendship or Love
   Our sympathies move;
When Truth, in a glance, should appear,
   The lips may beguile,
   With a dimple or smile,
But the test of affection's a Tear:

   Too oft is a smile
   But the hypocrite's wile,
To mask detestation, or fear;
   Give me the soft sigh,
   Whilst the soultelling eye
Is dimm'd, for a time, with a Tear:

   Mild Charity's glow,
   To us mortals below,
Shows the soul from barbarity clear;
   Compassion will melt,
   Where this virtue is felt,
And its dew is diffused in a Tear:

   The man, doom'd to sail
   With the blast of the gale,
Through billows Atlantic to steer,
   As he bends o'er the wave
   Which may soon be his grave,
The green sparkles bright with a Tear;

   The Soldier braves death
   For a fanciful wreath
In Glory's romantic career;
   But he raises the foe
   When in battle laid low,
And bathes every wound with a Tear.

   If, with high-bounding pride,
   He return to his bride!
Renouncing the gore-crimson'd spear;
   All his toils are repaid
   When, embracing the maid,
From her eyelid he kisses the Tear.

   Sweet scene of my youth!
   Seat of Friendship and Truth,
Where Love chas'd each fast-fleeting year
   Loth to leave thee, I mourn'd,
   For a last look I turn'd,
But thy spire was scarce seen through a Tear:

   Though my vows I can pour,
   To my Mary no more,
My Mary, to Love once so dear,
   In the shade of her bow'r,
   I remember the hour,
She rewarded those vows with a Tear.

   By another possest,
   May she live ever blest!
Her name still my heart must revere:
   With a sigh I resign,
   What I once thought was mine,
And forgive her deceit with a Tear.

   Ye friends of my heart,
   Ere from you I depart,
This hope to my breast is most near:
   If again we shall meet,
   In this rural retreat,
May we meet, as we part, with a Tear.

   When my soul wings her flight
   To the regions of night,
And my corse shall recline on its bier;
   As ye pass by the tomb,
   Where my ashes consume,
Oh! moisten their dust with a Tear.


'When I was just as far as I could walk From here today, There was an hour All still When leaning with my head again a flower I heard you talk. Don't say I didn't, for I heard you say-- You spoke from that flower on the window sill- Do you remember what it was you said?'  'First tell me what it was you thought you heard.'  'Having found the flower and driven a bee away, I leaned on my head And holding by the stalk, I listened and I thought I caught the word-- What was it? Did you call me by my name? Or did you say-- Someone said "Come" -- I heard it as I bowed.'  'I may have thought as much, but not aloud.'  "Well, so I came.':)           



What kids are watching on telly
are crimes and crimes in all variety! 

Crimes of hate 
crimes of passion
acting it out at shocking rate
thinking in some wild fashion
then ending up cell mates! 

When kids watch their movie heroes
shoot down people with the gun
they are incited to do the same
to achieve some thrill and fun.

When they see their very film star
slash someone's throat in a fit of anger
they think well of crimes of rage
and plunge everybody else into danger.

The tendency to portray the violent scene
luridly and shockingly on the Big Screen

Ah even for the small screen, tis the gory
that makes for the dark and thrilling story.

Now that technology's long opened this pandora's box
the dispersal of amplified social ills ain't no hoax

The rowdy hoodlums and reckless gangsters
are simply by-products of Tv influences
The world watches the thriving of the bully-boy pranksters
passively in helpless terror of their offences.

It's all portrayal of the vulgar, the obscene
by that devious Silver Screen

And the horror movie
though it may seem groovy
begets the horrendous
and drills evil thoughts subliminally
into the subconscious! 

It's an unrestrained dark faking
of real life reality exaggerating

Whether it's Bollywood in the East
or it's Hollywood in the West
they don't merely impart tactics of defence
but rather those of aggressive offence

Viewing those gruesome swashbuckling films
gives rise to morbid sadistic whims

Flipping through the TV channels
just ponder if the telly's the perfect channel
of information is it a proper panel? 

Dad always tells me, 'fear ye the roaches' flicking antennae? 
While you oughtta fear the influence
of 'em' flickering images by dish antennae'.

Then a mere single merit that I dug
as I drank cappucino in my mug
that atleast one couldn't live in a bubble
daily watching the bubblebug.

Ah but then tougher gun laws couldn't halt
even underage shooting sprees
Rather it's stringent scanning of Tv content
that might make it all cease

Parental supervision too tis gravely essential
Should've been of parental code quintessential

So the next time you catch your teen
absorbed and engrossed while glued to the screen
Just sleuth a bit just to make sure
that for the x-rated he's not too keen

Gladly engrave thy love in steel,
If what my soul doth feel sometimes
My soul might ever feel!

Although there were some forty heav'ns, or more,
Sometimes I peer above them all;
Sometimes I hardly reach a score,
Sometimes to hell I fall.

O rack me not to such a vast extent;
Those distances belong to thee:
The world's too little for thy tent,
A grave too big for me.

Wilt thou meet arms with man, that thou dost stretch
A crum of dust from heav'n to hell?
Shall he thy stature spell?

O let me, when thy roof my soul hath hid,
O let me roost and nestle there:
Then of a sinner thou art rid,
And I of hope and fear.

Yet take thy way; for sure thy way is best:
Stretch or contract me, thy poor debtor:
This is but tuning of my breast,
To make the music better.

Whether I fly with angels, fall with dust,
Thy hands made both, and I am there:
Thy power and love, my love and trust
Make one place ev'ry where. 

It cannot be.  Where is that mighty joy, 
Which just now took up all my heart? 
Save that, and me; or sin for both destroy.

The grosser world stand to thy word and art; 
But thy diviner world of grace
Thou suddenly dost raise and race, 
And ev'ry day a new Creator art

O fix thy chair of grace, that all my powers
May also fix their reverence: 
For when thou dost depart from hence, 
They grow unruly, and sit in thy bowers.

Scatter, or bind them all to bend to thee: 
Though elements change, and heaven move, 
Let not thy higher Court remove, 
But keep a standing Majesty in me. 

To leave the earth was my wish, and no will stayed my rising.
Early, before sun had filled the roads with carts
Conveying folk to weddings and to murders;
Before men left their selves of sleep, to wander
In the dark of the world like whipped beasts.

I took no pack. I had no horse, no staff, no gun.
I got up a little way and something called me,
Saying,
And I answered, 'It is your father who is lost, not mine.'
Then the sky filled with tears of blood, and snakes sang.


In that soft season, when descending show'rs
Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flow'rs;
When op'ning buds salute the welcome day,
And earth relenting feels the genial day,
As balmy sleep had charm'd my cares to rest,
And love itself was banish'd from my breast,
(What time the morn mysterious visions brings,
While purer slumbers spread their golden wings)
A train of phantoms in wild order rose,
And, join'd, this intellectual sense compose.
I stood, methought, betwixt earth, seas, and skies;
The whole creation open to my eyes:
In air self-balanc'd hung the globe below,
Where mountains rise and circling oceans flow;
Here naked rocks, and empty wastes were seen,
There tow'ry cities, and the forests green:
Here sailing ships delight the wand'ring eyes:
There trees, and intermingled temples rise;
Now a clear sun the shining scene displays,
The transient landscape now in clouds decays.
O'er the wide Prospect as I gaz'd around,
Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound,
Like broken thunders that at distance roar,
Then gazing up, a glorious pile beheld,
Whose tow'ring summit ambient clouds conceal'd.
High on a rock of Ice the structure lay,
Steep its ascent, and slipp'ry was the way;
The wond'rous rock like Parian marble shone,
And seem'd, to distant sight, of solid stone.
Inscriptions here of various Names I view'd,
The greater part by hostile time subdu'd;
Yet wide was spread their fame in ages past,
And Poets once had promis'd they should last.
Some fresh engrav'd appear'd of Wits renown'd;
I look'd again, nor could their trace be found.
Critics I saw, that other names deface,
And fix their own, with labour, in their place:
Their own, like others, soon their place resign'd,
Or disappear'd, and left the first behind.
Nor was the work impair'd by storms alone,
But felt th' approaches of too warm a sun;
For Fame, impatient of extremes, decays
Not more by Envy than excess of Praise.
Yet part no injuries of heav'n could feel,
Like crystal faithful to th' graving steel:
The rock's high summit, in the temple's shade,
Nor heat could melt, nor beating storm invade.
Their names inscrib'd, unnumber'd ages past
From time's first birth, with time itself shall last;
These ever new, nor subject to decays,
Spread, and grow brighter with the length of days.
So Zembla's rocks (the beauteous work of frost)
Rise white in air, and glitter o'er the coast;
Pale suns, unfelt, at distance roll away,
And on th' impassive ice the light'nings play;
Eternal snows the growing mass supply,
Till the bright mountains prop th' incumbent sky:
As Atlas fix'd, each hoary pile appears,
The gather'd winter of a thousand years.
On this foundation Fame's high temple stands;
Stupendous pile! not rear'd by mortal hands.
Whate'er proud Rome or artful Greece beheld,
Or elder Babylon, its frame excell'd.
Four faces had the dome, and ev'ry face
Of various structure, but of equal grace:
Four brazen gates, on columns lifted high,
Salute the diff'rent quarters of the sky.
Here fabled Chiefs in darker ages born,
Or Worthies old, whom arms or arts adorn,
Who cities rais'd, or tam'd a monstrous race;
The walls in venerable order grace:
Heroes in animated marble frown,
And Legislators seem to think in stone.
Westward, a sumptuous frontispiece appear'd,
On Doric pillars of white marble rear'd,
Crown'd with an architrave of antique mold,
And sculpture rising on the roughen'd mold,
In shaggy spoils here Theseus was beheld,
And Perseus dreadful with Minerva's shield:
There great Alcides stooping with his toil,
Rests on his club, and holds th' Hesperian spoil.
Here Orpheus sings; trees moving to the sound
Start from their roots, and form a shade around:
Amphion there the loud creating lyre
Strikes, and beholds a sudden Thebes aspire!
Cithaeron's echoes answer to his call,
And half the mountain rolls into a wall:
There might you see the length'ning spires ascend,
The domes swell up, the wid'ning arches bend,
The growing tow'rs, like exhalations rise,
And the huge columns heave into the skies.
The Eastern front was glorious to behold,
With di'mond flaming, and Barbaric gold.
There Ninus shone, who spread th' Assyrian fame,
And the great founder of the Persian name:
There in long robes the royal Magi stand,
Grave Zoroaster waves the circling wand,
The sage Chaldaeans rob'd in white appear'd,
And Brahmans, deep in desert woods rever'd.
These stop'd the moon, and call'd th' unbody'd shades
To midnight banquets in the glimm'ring glades;
Made visionary fabrics round them rise,
And airy spectres skim before their eyes;
Of Talismans and Sigils knew the pow'r,
And careful watch'd the Planetary hour.
Superior, and alone, Confucius stood,
Who taught that useful science, to be good.
But on the South, a long majestic race
Of AEgypt's Priests the gilded niches grace,
Who measur'd earth, describ'd the starry spheres,
And trac'd the long records of lunar years.
High on his car Sesostris struck my view,
Whom scepter'd slaves in golden harness drew:
His hands a bow and pointed javelin hold;
His giant limbs are arm'd in scales of gold.
Between the statues Obelisks were plac'd,
And the learn'd walls with Hieroglyphics grac'd.
Of Gothic structure was the Northern side,
O'erwrought with ornaments of barb'rous pride.
There huge Colosses rose, with trophies crown'd, 
And Runic characters were grav'd around.
There sate Zamolxis with erected eyes,
And Odin here in mimic trances dies.
There on rude iron columns, smear'd with blood,
The horrid forms of Scythian heroes stood,
Druids and Bards (their once loud harps unstrung)
And youths that died to be by Poets sung.
These and a thousand more of doubtful fame,
To whom old fables gave a lasting name,
In ranks adorn'd the Temple's outward face;
The wall in lustre and effect like Glass,
Which o'er each object casting various dyes,
Enlarges some, and others multiplies:
Nor void of emblem was the mystic wall,
For thus romantic Fame increases all.
The Temple shakes, the sounding gates unfold,
Wide vaults appear, and roofs of fretted gold:
Rais'd on a thousand pillars, wreath'd around
With laurel-foliage, and with eagles crown'd:
Of bright, transparent beryl were the walls,
The friezes gold, an gold the capitals:
As heav'n with stars, the roof with jewels glows,
And ever-living lamps depend in rows.
Full in the passage of each spacious gate,
The sage Historians in white garments wait;
Grav'd o'er their seats the form of Time was found,
His scythe revers'd, and both his pinions bound.
Within stood Heroes, who thro' loud alarms
In bloody fields pursu'd renown in arms.
High on a throne with trophies charg'd, I view'd
The Youth that all things but himself subdu'd;
His feet on sceptres and tiara's trod,
There Caesar, grac'd with both Minerva's, shone;
Unmov'd, superior still in ev'ry state,
And scarce detested in his Country's fate.
But chief were those, who not for empire fought,
But with their toils their people's safety bought:
High o'er the rest Epaminondas stood;
Timoleon, glorious in his brother's blood;
Bold Scipio, saviour of the Roman state;
Great in his triumphs, in retirement great;
And wise Aurelius, in whose well-taught mind
With boundless pow'r unbounded virtue join'd,
His own strict judge, and patron of mankind.
Much-suff'ring heroes next their honours claim,
Those of less noisy, and less guilty fame,
Fair Virtue's silent train: supreme of these
Here ever shines the godlike Socrates:
He whom ungrateful Athens could expell,
At all times just, but when he sign'd the Shell:
Here his abode the martyr'd Phocion claims,
With Agis, not the last of Spartan names:
Unconquered Cato shews the wound he tore,
And Brutus his ill Genius meets no more.
But in the centre of the hallow'd choir,
Six pompous columns o'er the rest aspire;
Around the shrine itself of Fame they stand,
Hold the chief honours, and the fane command.
High on the first, the mighty Homer shone; 
Eternal Adamant compos'd his throne;
Father of verse! in holy fillets drest,
His silver beard wav'd gently o'er his breast;
Tho' blind, a boldness in his looks appears;
In years he seem'd, but not impair'd by years.
The wars of Troy were round the Pillar seen:
Here Hector glorious from Patroclus' fall,
Here dragg'd in triumph round the Trojan wall,
Motion and life did ev'ry part inspire,
Bold was the work, and prov'd the master's fire;
A strong expression most he seem'd t' affect,
And here and there disclos'd a brave neglect.

A golden column next in rank appear'd,
On which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd;
Finish'd the whole, and labour'd ev'ry part,
With patient touches of unweary'd art:
The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate,
Compos'd his posture, and his look sedate;
On Homer still he fix'd a rev'rend eye,
Great without pride, in modest majesty.
In living sculpture on the sides were spread
The Latian Wars, and haughty Turnus dead;
Eliza stretch'd upon the fun'ral pyre,
AEneas ending with his aged sire:
Troy flam'd in burning gold, and o'er the throne
Arms of the Man in golden cyphers shone.
Four swans sustain a car of silver bright,
With heads advanc'd, and pinions stretch'd for flight:
Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode,
Across the harp a careless hand he flings,
And boldly sinks into the sounding strings.
The figur'd games of Greece the column grace,
Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race.
The youths hand o'er their chariots as they run;
The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone;
The champions in distorted postures threat;
And all appear'd irregularly great.
Here happy Horace tun'd th' Ausonian lyre
To sweeter sounds, and temper'd Pindar's fire:
Pleas'd with Alcaeus' manly rage t' infuse
The softer spirit of the Sapphic Muse.
The polish'd pillar diff'rent sculptures grace;
A work outlasting monumental brass.
Here smiling Loves and Bacchanals appear,
The Julian star, and great Augustus here,
The Doves that round the infant poet spread
Myrtles and bays, hung hov'ring o'er his head.
Here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light,
Sate fix'd in thought the mighty Stagirite;
His sacred head a radiant Zodiac crown'd,
And various Animals his sides surround;
His piercing eyes, erect, appear to view
Superior worlds, and look all Nature through.
With equal rays immortal Tully shone,
The Roman Rostra deck'd the Consul's throne:
Gath'ring his flowing robe, he seem'd to stand
In act to speak, and graceful stretch'd his hand.
Behind, Rome's Genius waits with Civic crowns,
And the great Father of his country owns.
These massy columns in a circle rise,
O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies:
Scarce to the top I stretch'd my aching sight,
So large it spread, and swell'd to such a height.
Full in the midst proud Fame's imperial seat,
With jewels blaz'd, magnificently great;
The vivid em'ralds there revive the eye,
The flaming rubies shew their sanguine dye,
Bright azure rays from lively sapphrys stream,
And lucid amber casts a golden gleam.
With various-colour'd light the pavement shone,
And all on fire appear'd the glowing throne;
The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze,
And forms a rainbow of alternate rays.
Scarce seem'd her stature of a cubit's height;
But swell'd to larger size, the more I gaz'd,
Till to the roof her tow'ring front she rais'd.
With her, the Temple ev'ry moment grew,
And ampler Vista's open'd to my view:
Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend,
And arches widen, and long aisles extend.
Such was her form as ancient bards have told,
Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold;
And thousand open eyes, and thousand list'ning ears.
Beneath, in order rang'd, the tuneful Nine
(Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine:
With eyes on Fame for ever fix'd, they sing;
For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string;
With time's first birth began the heav'nly lays,
And last, eternal, thro' the length of days.

Around these wonders as I cast a look,
The trumpet sounded, and the temple shoo,
And all the nations, summon'd at the call,
From diff'rent quarters fill the crowded hall:
Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard;
In various garbs promiscuous throngs appear'd;
Thick as the bees, that with the spring renew
Their flow'ry toils, and sip the fragrant dew,
When the wing'd colonies first tempt the sky,
O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly,
Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield,
And a low murmur runs along the field.
Millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend,
The poor, the rich, the valiant and the sage,
And boasting youth, and narrative old-age.
Their pleas were diff'rent, their request the same:
For good and bad alike are fond of Fame.
Some she disgrac'd, and some with honours crown'd;
Unlike successes equal merits found.
Thus her blind sister, fickle Fortune, reigns,
And, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains.
First at the shrine the Learned world appear,
'Long have we sought t' instruct and please mankind,
With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind;
But thank'd by few, rewarded yet by none,
We here appeal to thy superior throne:
On wit and learning the just prize bestow,
For fame is all we must expect below.'
The golden Trumpet of eternal Praise:
From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound,
That fills the circuit of the world around;
Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud;
The notes at first were rather sweet than loud:
By just degrees they ev'ry moment rise,
Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies.
At ev'ry breath were balmy odours shed,
Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread;
Less fragrant scents th' unfolding rose exhales,
Or spices breathing in Arabian gales.
Next these the good and just, an awful train,
Thus on their knees address the sacred fane.
'Since living virtue is with envy curs'd,
And the best men are treated like the worst,
And give each deed th' exact intrinsic worth.'
'Not with bare justice shall your act be crown'd'
(Said Fame) 'but high above desert renown'd:
Let fuller notes th' applauding world amaze,
And the full loud clarion labour in your praise.'
This band dismiss'd, behold another croud
The constant tenour of whose well-spent days
No less deserv'd a just return of praise.
But strait the direful Trump of Slander sounds;
Thro' the big dome the doubling thunder bounds;
Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies,
The dire report thro' ev'ry region flies,
In ev'ry ear incessant rumours rung,
And gath'ring scandals grew on ev'ry tongue.
From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke
Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:
The pois'nous vapour blots the purple skies,
And withers all before it as it flies.
A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore,
And proud defiance in their looks they bore:
'For thee' (they cry'd) 'amidst alarms and strife,
We sail'd in tempests down the stream of life;
For thee whole nations fill'd with flames and blood,
And swam to empire thro' the purple flood.
Those ills we dar'd, thy inspiration own,
What virtue seem'd, was done for thee alone.'
'Be all your acts in dark oblivion drown'd;
There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone,
Your statues moulder'd, and your names unknown!'
A sudden cloud straight snatch'd them from my sight,
And each majestic phantom sunk in night.
Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen;
Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien.
'Great idol of mankind! we neither claim
The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame!
But safe in deserts from th' applause of men,
Would die unheard of, as we liv'd unseen,
'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight
Those acts of goodness, which themselves requite.
To follow virtue ev'n for virtue's sake.'
'And live there men, who slight immortal fame?
Who then with incense shall adore our name?
But mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride
To blaze those virtues, which the good would hide.
Rise! Muses, rise; add all your tuneful breath,
These must not sleep in darkness and in death.'
She said: in air the trembling music floats,
And on the winds triumphant swell the notes;
So soft, tho' high, so loud, and yet so clear,
Ev'n list'ning Angels lean'd from heav'n to hear:
To farthest shores th' Ambrosial spirit flies,
Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies.
Next these a youthful train their vows express'd,
With feathers crown'd, with gay embroid'ry dress'd:
'Hither,' they cry'd, 'direct your eyes, and see
The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry;
Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays,
Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days;
Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care
To pay due visits, and address the fair:
In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade, 
But still in fancy vanquish'd ev'ry maid;
Of unknown Duchesses lewd tales we tell,
Yet, would the world believe us, all were well.
The joy let others have, and we the name,
And what we want in pleasure, grant in fame.'
And at each blast a Lady's honour dies.
Pleas'd with the strange success, vast numbers prest
Around the shrine, and made the same request:
'What? you,' (she cry'd) 'unlearn'd in arts to please,
Slaves to yourselves, and ev'n fatigu'd with ease,
Who lose a length of undeserving days,
Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise?
To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall,
The people's fable, and the scorn of all.'
Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound,
Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round,
Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud,
And scornful hisses run thro' the crowd.
Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done,
Enslave their country, or usurp a throne;
Or who their glory's dire foundation lay'd
On Sov'reigns ruin'd, or on friends betray'd;
Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix,
Of crooked counsels and dark politics;
Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne,
And beg to make th' immortal treasons known.
The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire,
With sparks, that seem'd to set the world on fire.
At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast,
And startled nature trembled with the blast.
This having heard and seen, and snatch'd me from the throne.
Before my view appear'd a structure fair,
Its site uncertain, if in earth or air;
With rapid motion turn'd the mansion round; 
With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound;
Not less in number were the spacious doors,
Than leaves on trees, or sand upon the shores;
Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day,
Pervious to winds, and open ev'ry way.
As flames by nature to the skies ascend,
As weighty bodies to the centre tend,
As to the sea returning rivers toll,
And the touch'd needle trembles to the pole;
Hither, as to their proper place, arise
All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies,
Or spoke aloud, or whisper'd in the ear;
Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here.
As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes
The sinking stone at first a circle makes;
The trembling surface by the motion stir'd,
Spreads in a second circle, then a third;
Wide, and more wide, the floating rings advance,
Fill all the wat'ry plain, and to the margin dance:
Thus ev'ry voice and sound, when first they break,
On neighb'ring air a soft impression make;
Another ambient circle then they move;
That, in its turn, impels the next above;
Thro' undulating air the sounds are sent,
And spread o'er all the fluid element.
There various news I heard of love and strife,
Of peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life,
Of loss and gain, of famine and of store,
Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore,
Of prodigies, and portents seen in air, 
Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair,
Of turns of fortune, changes in the state,
The falls of fav'rites, projects of the great,
Of old mismanagements, taxations new:
All neither wholly false, nor wholly true.
Above, below, without, within, around.
Confus'd, unnumber'd multitudes are found,
Who pass, repass, advance, and glide away;
Hosts rais'd by fear, and phantoms of a day:
Astrologers, that future fates foreshew,
Projectors, quacks, and lawyers not a few;
And priests, and party-zealots, num'rous bands
With home-born lies, or tales from foreign lands;
Each talk'd aloud, or in some secret place,
And wild impatience star'd in ev'ry face.
The flying rumours gather'd as they roll'd,
Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told;
And all who told it added something new,
And all who heard it, made enlargements too,
In ev'ry ear it spread, on ev'ry tongue it grew.
Thus flying east and west, and north and south,
News travel'd with increase from mouth to mouth.
So from a spark, that kindled first by chance,
With gath'ring force the quick'ning flames advance;
Till to the clouds their curling heads aspire,
And tow'rs and temples sink in floods of fire.
When thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung,
Full grown, and fit to grace a mortal tongue,
Thro' thousand vents, impatient, forth they flow,
And rush in millions on the world below.
Fame sits aloft, and points them out their course,
Their date determines, and prescribes their force:
Some to remain, and some to perish soon;
Or wane and wax alternate like the moon.
Around, a thousand winged wonders fly,
Borne by the trumpet's blast, and scatter'd thro' the sky.
There, at one passage, oft you might survey
A lie and truth contending for the way;
And long 'twas doubtful, both so closely pent, 
Which first should issue thro' the narrow vent:
At last agreed, together out they fly,
Inseparable now, the truth and lie;
The strict companions are for ever join'd,
And this or that unmix'd, no mortal e'er shall find.
While thus I stood, intent to see and hear,
One came, methought, and whisper'd in my ear:
What could thus high thy rash ambition raise?
Art thou, fond youth, a candidate for praise?
'Tis true, said I, not void of hopes I came,
For who so fond as youthful bards of Fame?
But few, alas! the casual blessing boast,
So hard to gain, so easy to be lost.
How vain that second life in others breath,
Th' estate which wits inherit after death!
Ease, health, and life, for this they must resign,
(Unsure the tenure, but how vast the fine!)
The great man's curse, without the gains endure,
Be envy'd, wretched, and be flatter'd, poor;
All luckless wits their enemies profest,
And all successful, jealous friends at best.
Nor Fame I slight, nor for her favours call;
She comes unlook'd for, if she comes at all.
But if the purchase costs so dear a price,
As soothing Folly, or exalting Vice:
Oh! if the Muse must flatter lawless sway,
And follow still where fortune leads the way;
Or if no basis bear my rising name,
But the fall'n ruin of another's fame;
Then teach me, heav'n! to scorn the guilty bays,
Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise,
Unblemish'd let me live, or die unknown;
Oh grant an honest fame, or grant me none

Sacred to peace, within a wood's recess,
A blest retreat, where courtiers never press,
A temple stands, where art did never try
With pompous wonders to enchant the eye;
There are no dazzling ornaments, nor vain,
But truth, simplicity, and nature reign:
The virtuous Gauls raised erst the noble shrine,
And sacred vowed to Friendship's power divine.
Mistaken mortals who believed their race,
Would never cease to crowd to such a place!
Orestes' name, and Pylades' appear,
Wrote on the front, names still to Friendship dear:
Pirithous' medal of uncommon size,
Those of soft Nisus and Achates wise.
All these are heroes, and as friends renowned,
These names are great, but still in fable found;
The power to this remote retreat retired,
Nor Tripod boasts, nor priests with truth inspired;
She miracles but seldom can effect,
No popish saint e'er met with such neglect.
Still in her presence faithful truth attends,
And to the goddess needful succor lends:
Truth's every ready to enlighten all,
But few on truth for kind assistance call.
In vain she waits for votaries at her shrine,
None come, though all at wanting her repine;
Her hand holds forth the register exact,
Of every generous, every friendly act;
Favors in which esteem with friendship vied,
Received not meanly, not conferred with pride:
Such favors as those who confer forget,
And who receive, declare without regret.
This history of the virtues of mankind,
Within a narrow compass is confined;
In Gothic characters all these are traced
Upon two sheets, by time almost defaced.
By what strange frenzy is mankind possessed,
Friendship is banished now from every breast;
Yet all usurp of Friend the sacred name,
And vilest hypocrites bring in their claim.
All that they're faithful to her laws maintain,
And even her enemies her rights profane:
In regions subject to the pope's command,
Thus we see beads oft in an atheist's hand.
'Tis said the goddess, each pretended friend,
Once in her presence summoned to attend;
She fixed the day on which they should be there,
A prize proposing for each faithful pair;
Who with a tenderness like hers replete,
Amongst true friends might justly claim a seat;
Then quickly came allured by such a prize,
The French who novelty still idolize:
A multitude before the temple came,
And first, two courtly friends preferred their claim,
By interest joined, thy walked still hand in hand,
And of their union Friendship thought the band:
Post-haste a courier came and made report,
That there was then a vacancy at court;
Away each friend polite that moment flies,
Forsakes at once the temple and the prize;
Thus in a moment friends are turned to foes,
Each swears his rival warmly to oppose:
Four devotees next issue from the throng,
Poring on prayer-books as they pass along;
Their charity to mankind overflows,
And with religious zeal their bosom glows.
A pampered prelate one with fat o'ergrown,
Triple-chinned, much to apoplexy prone;
The swine quite gorged with tithes, and overfed,
At length by indigestion's force lies dead:
Quick the confessor clears the sinner's score,
His soles are greased, his body sprinkled o'er,
And spruced up by the curate of the place,
To go his heavenly journey with good grace;
His three friends o'er him merrily say prayers,
His benefice alone excites their cares:
Devoutly rivals grown, each still pretends
Attachment most sincere to both his friends;
Yet all in making interest at the court,
Their brothers downright Jansenists report.
Two youths of fashion next came arm in arm,
Their eyes and hearts, their mistress letters charm:
These as they passed along they read aloud,
And both displayed their persons to the crowd;
Some favorite airs they sing, while they advance
Up to the altar, just as to a dance:
They fight about some trifle, one is slain,
And Friendship's altar hence receives a stain;
The less mad of the two with conquest crowned,
Left his dear friend expiring on the ground.
Next Lisis, with her much loved Chloe came,
From infancy their pleasures were the same;
Alike their humor, and alike their age,
Those trifles which the female heart engage;
Lisis was prone to Chloe to impart,
They spoke the overflowings of the heart;
At last one lover touched both female friends,
And strange to tell! here all their Friendship ends;
Lisis and Chloe Friendship's shrine forsake,
And the high road to Hatred's temple take.
The beauteous Zara shone forth in her turn,
With eyes that languish, whilst our hearts they burn:
'What languor,' said she, 'reigns in this abode!
By that sad goddess, say what joy's bestowed?
Here dismal melancholy dwells alone,
For love's soft joys are ever here unknown.'
Leaving the place, crowds followed her behind,
And struck with envy, twenty beauties pined:
Where next my Zara went, is known to none,
And Friendship's glorious prize could not be won:
The goddess everywhere so much admired;
So little known, and yet by all admired;
With cold upon her sacred altar froze--
Hence hapless mortals, hence derive your woes. 

Fragile in the tender night, 
I want to kiss you in the moonlight, 
Gently speak your name as you softly gaze
Into a romantic candle’s flickering flame, 
Make you feel like nothing is more important
Than your sacred heartbeats-

I am in love with you
And I want us to wander
Through the exciting city
Of amorous breaths and dreams
Until we are entangled
Inseparably with happiness. 

Cooling the tension
Holding all those lies
Falling apart; 
Give into the moment, 
Feels like life? 
I suppose we’ve always, 
Been alive-
Helping the tension; 
Just one more minute, 
Will provide the awkward
Tilt your thoughts, 
Sweeping into the depths
Of your words
I’ll catch that breath
Of the lost sensuous 
Cold, hard touch
Holding apart-
Feel that fleshy lust
I want your hands, 
I want them-
To warm mine; 
I want your light smile
Please make my sun
Shine-
Hard to say what I mean
Because time stops
For no one-
And it seems to be; 
Making the moment
Pass too quickly


On this day many years ago
Palms on the path they did throw
Later to reject and to damn
The Shepherd that had caused no strife

The Son of Man
For all us sinner's sake
Died at the hand of satan
For forgiveness and eternal life

It's our spirit He shall return to take to wife. 

Some primal termite knocked on wood 
And tasted it, and found it good! 
And that is why your Cousin May 
Fell through the parlor floor today. 

Reality is a question 
of realizing how real 
the world is already. 

Time is Eternity, 
ultimate and immovable; 
everyone's an angel. 

It's Heaven's mystery 
of changing perfection : 
absolute Eternity 

changes! Cars are always 
going down the street, 
lamps go off and on. 

It's a great flat plain; 
we can see everything 
on top of a table. 

Clams open on the table, 
lambs are eaten by worms 
on the plain. The motion 

of change is beautiful, 
as well as form called 
in and out of being. 


Next : to distinguish process 
in its particularity with 
an eye to the initiation 

of gratifying new changes 
desired in the real world. 
Here we're overwhelmed 

with such unpleasant detail 
we dream again of Heaven. 
For the world is a mountain 

of shit : if it's going to 
be moved at all, it's got 
to be taken by handfuls. 


Man lives like the unhappy 
whore on River Street who 
in her Eternity gets only 

a couple of bucks and a lot 
of snide remarks in return 
for seeking physical love 

the best way she knows how, 
never really heard of a glad 
job or joyous marriage or 

a difference in the heart : 
or thinks it isn't for her, 
which is her worst misery. 




'Twas in the year of  and on the h and h of November,
Which the people of Dundee and elsewhere will long remember,
The terrific cyclone that blew down trees,
And wrecked many vessels on the high seas. 

All along the coast the Storm Fiend did loudly roar,
Whereby many ships were wrecked along the shore,


Which caused their children to mourn and their wives. 

Alas! they wiil never see their husbands again,
And to weep for them 'tis all in vain,
Because sorrow never could revive the dead,
Therefore they must weep, knowing all hope is fled. 

The people's hearts in Dundee were full of dread
For fear of chimney-cans falling on their heads,
And the roofs of several houses were hurled to the ground,
And the tenants were affrighted, and their sorrow was profound, 

And scores of wooden sheds were levelled to the ground,
And chimney stalks fell with a crashing rebound :
The gale swept everything before it in its way;
No less than trees and tombstones were blown down at Balgay. 

Oh! it was a pitiful and a terrible sight
To see the fallen trees lying left and right,
Scattered about in the beautiful Hill of Balgay,
Also the tombstones that were swept away. 

At Broughty Ferry the gale made a noise like thunder,
Which made the inhabitants shake with fear and wonder
If their dwellings would be blown to the ground,
While the slates and chimney-cans were falling all around. 

Early on the h a disaster occurred on the Tay :
The wreck of the steamer "Union,"- Oh! horror and dismay!
Whereby four lives have been taken away,
Which will make their friends mourn for many a day. 

The steamer left Newburgh for Dundee with a cargo of sand,
And the crew expected they would safely land,
But by the time the steamer was opposite Dundee,
Alas! stronger blew the gale, and heavier grew the sea. 

And in order to prevent stranding the anchor was let go,
And with the cold the hearts of the crew were full of woe,
While the merciless Storm . 

Fiend loudly did roar,
As the vessel was driven towards the Fife shore. 

Then the crew took shelter in the stokehole,
From the cold wind they could no longer thole,
But the high seas broke over her, one finding its way
Right into the stokehole, which filled the crew's hearts with dismay. 

Then one of the crew, observing that the steamer had broached to,
Immediately went on deck to see what he could do,
And he tried hard to keep her head to the sea,
But the big waves dashed over her furiously. 

Then Strachan shouted that the "Union" was sinking fast,
Which caused his companions to stand aghast,
And Strachan tried to lower the small boat,
But alas! the vessel sunk, and the boat wouldn't float, 

And before he could recover himself he was struggling in the sea,
And battling with the big waves right manfully,
But his companions sank with the "Union" in the Tay,
Which filled Strachan's heart with sorrow and dismay, 

And after a great struggle he reached the beach,
Fortunately so, which he never expected to reach,
For often he was drawn back by the back-wash,
As the big waves against his body did dash. 

But, when nearly exhausted, and near to the land,
A piece of wreckage was near him, which he grasped with his hand,
Which providentially came within his reach,
And bruised, and battered, he was thrown on the beach. 

He was so exhausted, he was unable to stand upright,
He felt so weakly, he was in such a plight,
Because the big waves had done him bodily harm,
Yet on hands and knees he crept to a house at Northfield farm. 

He arrived there at ten minutes past four o'clock,
And when he awakened the inmates, their nerves got a shock,
But under their kind treatment he recovered speedily,
And was able to recount the disaster correctly. 

Oh! it was a fearful, and a destructive storm!
I never mind the like since I was born,
Only the Tay Bridge storm of 
And both these storms will be remembered for a very long time. 


Our life is a fire dampened, or a fire shut up in stone.
                        --Jacob Boehme, De Incarnatione Verbi

Outside everything visible and invisible a blazing maple.
Daybreak: a seam at the curve of the world.  The trousered legs of the women
   shimmered.
They held their arms in front of them like ghosts.

The coal bones of the house clinked in a kimono of smoke.
An attention hovered over the dream where the world had been.

For if Hiroshima in the morning, after the bomb has fallen,
        is like a dream, one must ask whose dream it is. {

Must understand how not to speak would carry it with us.
With bones put into rice bowls.
While the baby crawled over its dead mother seeking milk.

Muga-muchu {: without self, without center.  Thrown up in the sky by a wind.

The way back is lost, the one obsession.
The worst is over.
The worst is yet to come.





Oh King of grief! (a title strange, yet true, 
To thee of all kings only due) 
Oh King of wounds! how shall I grieve for thee, 
Who in all grief preventest me? 
Shall I weep blood? why thou has wept such store
That all thy body was one door.
Shall I be scourged, flouted, boxed, sold? 
'Tis but to tell the tale is told.
Was such a grief as cannot be.
Shall I then sing, skipping, thy doleful story, 
And side with thy triumphant glory? 
Shall thy strokes be my stroking? thorns, my flower? 
Thy rod, my posy? cross, my bower? 
But how then shall I imitate thee, and
Copy thy fair, though bloody hand? 
Surely I will revenge me on thy love, 
And try who shall victorious prove.
If thou dost give me wealth, I will restore
All back unto thee by the poor.
If thou dost give me honour, men shall see, 
The honour doth belong to thee.
I will not marry; or, if she be mine, 
She and her children shall be thine.
My bosom friend, if he blaspheme thy name, 
I will tear thence his love and fame.
One half of me being gone, the rest I give
Unto some Chapel, die or live.
As for thy passion - But of that anon, 
When with the other I have done.
For thy predestination I'll contrive, 
That three years hence, if I survive, 
I'll build a spittle, or mend common ways, 
But mend mine own without delays.
Then I will use the works of thy creation, 
As if I us'd them but for fashion.
The world and I will quarrel; and the year
Shall not perceive, that I am here.
My music shall find thee, and ev'ry string
Shall have his attribute to sing; 
That all together may accord in thee, 
If thou shalt give me wit, it shall appear; 
If thou hast giv'n it me, 'tis here.
Nay, I will read thy book, and never move
Till I have found therein thy love; 
Thy art of love, which I'll turn back on thee, 
O my dear Saviour, Victory! 
Then for thy passion - I will do for that - 


Dearest Son, 


Today is the day that you are born

Your eventual exception to the way I will raise you will remain

Hugs, flowers and kisses, everything that I have I give to you

I wish I could isolate myself from your life

From whom you are going to grow up to be

But how can I? - The apple does not fall far from the tree! 

Therefore my apologies at this time of birth I offer

That my ideas rub off on you and cause you to be who you didn’t want to be

Or that my way of upbringing causes you to be a recluse

But you did all right for yourself as an adult but hated still some of my influences

In time, I would get older and weaker and you will get older and stronger

In time I will lose my faculties and you will get smarter

But label not my ways as foolish I beg of you

What I have, I will give to you - Food, comfort, life

In so far as not to our past we can return to change things, for that is foolish to think

But in time therefore, consider my actions and find them ‘blameless’

I too shall consider your ways ‘blameless’

But by this understanding, that we may pursue life in great fulfillment and joy


I hope you can accept the outcome of your life on this day of your birth



When I walk in my house I see pictures,
bought long ago, framed and hanging
—de Kooning, Arp, Laurencin, Henry Moore—
that I've cherished and stared at for years,
yet my eyes keep returning to the masters 
of the trivial—a white stone perfectly round, 
tiny lead models of baseball players, a cowbell, 
a broken great-grandmother's rocker,
a dead dog's toy—valueless, unforgettable 
detritus that my children will throw away
as I did my mother's souvenirs of trips 
with my dead father, Kodaks of kittens, 
and bundles of cards from her mother Kate. 


I rock and roll with passion
I talk out my soul with a passion

I eat good food with passion
I defeat bad mood with a passion

I sleep well with passion
I weep hell with a passion

I dream endlessly with passion
I gleam ceaselessly with a passion

I aim for money with passion
I do the same for honey with a passion

I listen carefully with passion
I glisten dutifully with a passion

I search for fame with passion
I research to blame with a passion

I walk everyday with passion
I talk and play with a passion

I embrace life with passion
I face nightlife with a passion

I laugh out with passion
I chaffe about with a passion

I cook with others with passion
I look at mothers with a passion

I touch gently with passion
I clutch tightly with a passion

I work hard with a passion
I rock mad with a passion

I gear up goals with passion
I stir up roles with a passion

I make friends with passion
I take weekends with a passion

I love kissing with passion
I love teasing with a passion

I make love with passion
I take from above with a passion

If push comes to shove
Label me old fashioned
For these are things I caption
In life with all my passion


He to Amyntas, Kings of Macedon;
The cruel proud Olympias was his Mother,
She to Epirus warlike King was daughter.
This Prince (his father by Pausanias slain)
The twenty first of's age began to reign.
Great were the Gifts of nature which he had,
His education much to those did adde:
By art and nature both he was made fit,
To 'complish that which long before was writ.
The very day of his Nativity
To ground was burnt Dianaes Temple high:
An Omen to their near approaching woe,
Whose glory to the earth this king did throw.
His Rule to Greece he scorn'd should be confin'd,
The Universe scarce bound his proud vast mind.
This is the He-Goat which from Grecia came,
That ran in Choler on the Persian Ram,
That brake his horns, that threw him on the ground
To save him from his might no man was found:
Philip on this great Conquest had an eye,
But death did terminate those thoughts so high.
The Greeks had chose him Captain General,
Which honour to his Son did now befall.
(For as Worlds Monarch now we speak not on,
But as the King of little Macedon)
Restless both day and night his heart then was,
His high resolves which way to bring to pass;
Yet for a while in Greece is forc'd to stay,
Which makes each moment seem more then a day.
Thebes and stiff Athens both 'gainst him rebel,
Their mutinies by valour doth he quell.
This done against both right and natures Laws,
His kinsmen put to death, who gave no cause;
That no rebellion in in his absence be,
Nor making Title unto Sovereignty.
And all whom he suspects or fears will climbe,
Now taste of death least they deserv'd in time,
Nor wonder is t if he in blood begin,
For Cruelty was his parental sin,
Thus eased now of troubles and of fears,
Next spring his course to Asia he steers;
Leavs Sage Antipater, at home to sway,
And through the Hellispont his Ships made way.
Coming to Land, his dart on shore he throws,
Then with alacrity he after goes;
And with a bount'ous heart and courage brave,
His little wealth among his Souldiers gave.
And being ask'd what for himself was left,
Reply'd, enough, sith only hope he kept.
Thirty two thousand made up his Foot force,
To which were joyn'd five thousand goodly horse.
Then on he marcht, in's way he view'd old Troy,
And on Achilles tomb with wondrous joy
He offer'd, and for good success did pray
To him, his Mothers Ancestors, (men say)
When news of Alexander came to Court,
To scorn at him Darius had good sport;
Sends him a frothy and contemptuous Letter,
Stiles him disloyal servant, and no better;
Reproves him for his proud audacity
To lift his hand 'gainst such a Monarchy.
Then to's Lieftenant he in Asia sends
That he be ta'ne alive, for he intends
To whip him well with rods, and so to bring
That boy so mallipert before the King.
Ah! fond vain man, whose pen ere while
In lower terms was taught a higher stile.
To River Granick Alexander hyes
Which in Phrygia near Propontike lyes.
The Persians ready for encounter stand,
And strive to keep his men from off the land;
Those banks so steep the Greeks yet scramble up,
And beat the coward Persians from the top,
And twenty thousand of their lives bereave,
Who in their backs did all their wounds receive.
This victory did Alexander gain,
With loss of thirty four of his there slain;
Then Sardis he, and Ephesus did gain,
VVhere stood of late, Diana's wondrous Phane,
And by Parmenio (of renowned Fame,)
Miletus and Pamphilia overcame.
Hallicarnassus and Pisidia 
He for his Master takes with Lycia.
Next Alexander marcht towards the black Sea,
And easily takes old Gordium in his way;
Of Ass ear'd Midas, once the Regal Seat,
VVhose touch turn'd all to gold, yea even his meat
VVhere the Prophetick knot he cuts in twain,
Now news of Memnon's death (the Kings Viceroy)
To Alexanders heart's no little joy,
For in that Peer, more valour did abide,
Then in Darius multitude beside:
In's stead, was Arses plac'd, but durst not stay,
Yet set one in his room, and ran away;
His substitute as fearfull as his master,
Runs after two, and leaves all to Disaster.
Then Alexander all Cilicia takes,
No stroke for it he struck, their hearts so quakes.
To Greece he thirty thousand talents sends,
To raise more Force to further his intends:
Then o're he goes Darius now to meet,
Who came with thousand thousands at his feet.
Though some there be (perhaps) more likely write
He but four hundred thousand had to fight,
The rest Attendants, which made up no less,
Both Sexes there was almost numberless.
For this wise King had brought to see the sport,
With him the greatest Ladyes of the Court,
It seems to see the Macedonian slaughters.
Its much beyond my time and little art,
To shew how great Darius plaid his part;
The splendor and the pomp he marched in,
For since the world was no such Pageant seen.
Sure 'twas a goodly sight there to behold,
The Persians clad in silk, and glistering gold,
The stately horses trapt, the lances gilt,
As if addrest now all to run a tilt.
The holy fire was borne before the host,
(For Sun and Fire the Persians worship most)
The Priests in their strange habit follow after,
An object, not so much of fear as laughter.
The King sate in a chariot made of gold,
With crown and Robes most glorious to behold,
Support a party coloured Canopy.
A number of spare horses next were led,
Lest he should need them in his Chariots stead;
But those that saw him in this state to lye,
Suppos'd he neither meant to fight nor flye.
He fifteen hundred had like women drest;
For thus to fright the Greeks he judg'd was best.
Their golden ornaments how to set forth,
Would ask more time then was their bodies worth
Great Sysigambis she brought up the Reer,
Then such a world of waggons did appear,
Like several houses moving upon wheels,
As if she'd drawn whole Shushan at her heels:
This brave Virago to the King was mother,
And as much good she did as any other.
Now lest this gold, and all this goodly stuff
Had not been spoyle and booty rich enough
A thousand mules and Camels ready wait
Loaden with gold, with jewels and with plate:
For sure Darius thought at the first sight,
The Greeks would all adore, but none would fight
But when both Armies met, he might behold
That valour was more worth then pearls or gold,
And that his wealth serv'd but for baits to 'lure
To make his overthrow more fierce and sure.
The Greeks came on and with a gallant grace
Let fly their arrows in the Persians face.
The cowards feeling this sharp stinging charge
Most basely ran, and left their king at large:
Who from his golden coach is glad to 'light,
And cast away his crown for swifter flight:
Of late like some immoveable he lay,
Now finds both legs and horse to run away.
Two hundred thousand men that day were slain,
And forty thousand prisoners also tane,
If Curtius be true in his report.
The Regal Ornaments were lost, the treasure
Divided at the Macedonians pleasure;
Yet all this grief, this loss, this overthrow,
Was but beginning of his future woe.
The royal Captives brought to Alexander 
T'ward them demean'd himself like a Commander
For though their beauties were unparaled,
Conquer'd himself now he had conquered,
Preserv'd their honour, us'd them bounteously,
Commands no man should doe them injury:
And this to Alexander is more fame
Then that the Persian King he overcame.
Two hundred eighty Greeks he lost in fight,
By too much heat, not wounds (as authors write)
No sooner had this Victor won the field,
But all Phenicia to his pleasure yield,
Of which the Goverment he doth commit
Unto Parmenio of all most fit.
Darius now less lofty then before,
To Alexander writes he would restore
Those mournfull Ladies from Captivity,
For whom he offers him a ransome high:
But down his haughty stomach could not bring,
To give this Conquerour the Stile of King.
This Letter Alexander doth disdain,
And in short terms sends this reply again,
A King he was, and that not only so,
But of Darius King, as he should know.
Next Alexander unto Tyre doth goe,
His valour and his victoryes they know:
To gain his love the Tyrians intend,
Therefore a crown and great Provision send,
Their present he receives with thankfullness,
Desires to offer unto Hercules,
Protector of their town, by whom defended,
And from whom he lineally descended.
But they accept not this in any wise,
Lest he intend more fraud then sacrifice,
Sent word that Hercules his temple stood
In the old town, (which then lay like a wood)
With this reply he was so deep enrag'd,
To win the town, his honour he ingag'd:
And now as Babels King did once before,
He leaves not till he made the sea firm shore,
But far less time and cost he did expend,
The former Ruines forwarded his end:
Moreover had a Navy at command,
The other by his men fetcht all by land.
In seven months time he took that wealthy town,
Whose glory now a second time's brought down.
Two thousand of the chief he crucifi'd,
Eight thousand by the sword then also di'd,
And thirteen thousand Gally slaves he made,
And thus the Tyrians for mistrust were paid.
The rule of this he to Philotas gave
Who was the son of that Parmenio brave.
Cilicia to Socrates doth give,
For now's the time Captains like Kings may live.
Zidon he on Ephestion bestowes;
(For that which freely comes, as freely goes)
He scorns to have one worse then had the other,
Ephestion having chief command of th'Fleet,
At Gaza now must Alexander meet.
Darius finding troubles still increase,
By his Ambassadors now sues for peace,
And layes before great Alexanders eyes
The dangers difficultyes like to rise,
First at Euphrates what he's like to 'bide,
And then at Tygris and Araxis side,
These he may scape, and if he so desire,
A league of friendship make firm and entire.
His eldest daughter he in mariage profers,
And a most princely dowry with her offers.
All those rich Kingdomes large that do abide
Betwixt the Hellespont and Halys side.
But he with scorn his courtesie rejects,
And the distressed King no whit respects,
Tells him, these proffers great, in truth were none
For all he offers now was but his own.
But quoth Parmenio that brave Commander,
Was I as great, as is great Alexander,
Darius offers I would not reject,
But th'kingdomes and the Lady soon accept.
To which proud Alexander made reply,
And so if I Parmenio was, would I.
He now to Gaza goes, and there doth meet,
His Favorite Ephestion with his Fleet,
Where valiant Betis stoutly keeps the town,
(A loyal Subject to Darius Crown)
For more repulse the Grecians here abide
Then in the Persian Monarchy beside;
And by these walls so many men were slain,
That Greece was forc'd to yield supply again.
But yet this well defended Town was taken,
For 'twas decree'd, that Empire should be shaken;
Thus Betis ta'en had holes bor'd through his feet,
And by command was drawn through every street
To imitate Achilles in his shame,
Who did the like to Hector (of more fame)
What hast thou lost thy magnimity,
Can Alexander deal thus cruelly?
Sith valour with Heroicks is renown'd,
Though in an Enemy it should be found;
If of thy future fame thou hadst regard,
Why didst not heap up honours and reward?
From Gaza to Jerusalem he goes,
But in no hostile way, (as I suppose)
Him in his Priestly Robes high Jaddus meets,
Whom with great reverence Alexander greets;
The Priest shews him good Daniel's Prophesy,
How he should overthrow this Monarchy,
By which he was so much encouraged,
No future dangers he did ever dread.
From thence to fruitful Egypt marcht with speed,
Where happily in's wars he did succeed;
To see how fast he gain'd was no small wonder,
For in few dayes he brought that Kingdome under.
Then to the Phane of Jupiter he went,
The Pagan Priest through hire, or else mistake,
The Son of Jupiter did streight him make:
He Diobolical must needs remain,
That his humanity will not retain.
Thence back to Egypt goes, and in few dayes;
Fair Alexandria from the ground doth raise;
Then setling all things in less Asia;
In Syria, Egypt, and Phenicia,
Unto Euphrates marcht and overgoes,
For no man's there his Army to oppose;
Had Betis now been there but with his band,
Great Alexander had been kept from Land.
But as the King, so is the multitude,
And now of valour both are destitute.
Yet he (poor prince) another Host doth muster,
Of Persians, Scythians, Indians in a cluster;
Men but in shape and name, of valour none
Most fit, to blunt the Swords of Macedon.
Two hundred fifty thousand by account,
Of Horse and Foot his Army did amount;
For in his multitudes his trust still lay,
But on their fortitude he had small stay;
Yet had some hope that on the spacious plain,
His numbers might the victory obtain.
Who had sore travail and much sorrow seen,
Now bids the world adue, with pain being spent,
Great Alexander mourns as well as he,
The more because not set at liberty;
When this sad news (at first Darius hears,
Some injury was offered he fears:
But when inform'd how royally the King,
Had used her, and hers, in every thing,
Great Alexander for this good regard;
And if they down his Monarchy will throw,
Let them on him this dignity bestow.
And now for peace he sues as once before,
And offers all he did and Kingdomes more;
His eldest daughter for his princely bride,
(Nor was such match in all the world beside)
And all those Countryes which (betwixt) did lye
Phanisian Sea, and great Euphrates high:
With fertile Egypt and rich Syria,
And all those Kingdomes in less Asia.
With thirty thousand Talents to be paid,
And till all this be well perform'd, and sure,
Ochus his Son for Hostage should endure.
To this stout Alexander gives no ear,
No though Parmenio plead, yet will not hear;
Which had he done. (perhaps) his fame he'd kept,
Nor Infamy had wak'd, when he had slept,
For his unlimited prosperity
Him boundless made in vice and Cruelty.
Thus to Darius he writes back again,
The Firmament, two Suns cannot contain.
Two Monarchyes on Earth cannot abide,
Nor yet two Monarchs in one world reside;
The afflicted King finding him set to jar,
Prepares against to morrow, for the war,
Parmenio, Alexander, wisht that night,
To force his Camp, so vanquish them by flight.
For tumult in the night doth cause most dread,
And weakness of a Foe is covered,
But he disdain'd to steal a victory:
The Sun should witness of his valour be,
And careless in his bed, next morne he lyes,
By Captains twice is call'd before hee'l rise,
The Armyes joyn'd a while, the Persians fight,
And spilt the Greeks some bloud before their flight
But long they stood not e're they're forc'd to run,
So made an end, As soon as well begun.
Forty five thousand Alexander had,
But is not known what slaughter here was made,
Some write th'other had a million, some more,
But Quintus Curtius as before.
At Arbela this victory was gain'd,
Together with the Town also obtain'd;
Darius stript of all to Media came,
Accompan'ed with sorrow, fear, and shame,
At Arbela left his Ornaments and Treasure,
Which Alexander deals as suits his pleasure.
This conqueror to Babylon then goes,
Is entertain'd with joy and pompous showes,
With showrs of flours the streets along are strown,
And incense burnt the silver Altars on.
The glory of the Castle he admires,
The strong Foundation and the lofty Spires,
In this, a world of gold and Treasure lay,
Which in few hours was carried all away.
With greedy eyes he views this City round,
Whose fame throughout the world was so renownd
And to possess he counts no little bliss
The towres and bowres of proud Semiramis,
Though worne by time, and rac'd by foes full sore,
Yet old foundations shew'd and somewhat more.
With all the pleasures that on earth are found,
This city did abundantly abound,
Where four and thirty dayes he now did stay,
And gave himself to banqueting and play:
He and his souldiers wax effeminate,
And former discipline begin to hate.
Whilst revelling at Babylon he lyes,
Antipater from Greece sends fresh supplyes.
He then to Shushan goes with his new bands,
But needs no force, tis rendred to his hands.
He likewise here a world of treasure found;
For 'twas the seat of Persian Kings renownd.
Here stood the royal Houses of delight,
Where Kings have shown their glory wealth and might
And of good Mordicai, her kinsman dear,
Those purple hangings, mixt with green and white
Those beds of gold, and couches of delight.
And furniture the richest in all lands,
Now fall into the Macedonians hands.
From Shushan to Persipolis he goes,
Which news doth still augment Darius woes.
In his approach the governour sends word,
For his receipt with joy they all accord,
With open gates the wealthy town did stand,
And all in it was at his high command.
Of all the Cities that on earth was found,
None like to this in riches did abound:
Though Babylon was rich and Shushan too
Yet to compare with this they might not doe:
Here lay the bulk of all those precious things
That did pertain unto the Persian Kings:
For when the souldiers rifled had their pleasure,
And taken money plate and golden treasure,
Statues some gold, and silver numberless,
Yet after all, as storyes do express
The share of Alexander did amount
To an hundred thousand talents by account.
Here of his own he sets a Garison,
(As first at Shushan and at Babylon)
On their old Governours titles he laid,
But on their faithfulness he never staid,
Their place gave to his Captains (as was just)
For such revolters false, what King can trust?
The riches and the pleasures of this town
Now makes this King his virtues all to drown,
That wallowing in all licentiousness,
In pride and cruelty to high excess.
Being inflam'd with wine upon a season,
Filled with madness, and quite void of reason,
He at a bold proud strumpets leud desire,
Commands to set this goodly town on fire.
Parmenio wise intreats him to desist
And layes before his eyes if he persist
His fames dishonour, loss unto his state,
And just procuring of the Persians hate:
But deaf to reason, bent to have his will,
Those stately streets with raging flame did fill.
Then to Darius he directs his way,
Who was retir'd as far as Media,
And there with sorrows, fears & cares surrounded
Had now his army fourth and last compounded.
Which forty thousand made, but his intent
Was these in Bactria soon to augment:
But hearing Alexander was so near,
Thought now this once to try his fortunes here,
And rather chose an honourable death,
Then still with infamy to draw his breath:
But Bessus false, who was his chief Commander
Perswades him not to fight with Alexander.
With sage advice he sets before his eyes
The little hope of profit like to rise:
If when he'd multitudes the day he lost,
Then with so few, how likely to be crost.
This counsel for his safety he pretended,
But to deliver him to's foe intended.
Next day this treason to Darius known
Transported sore with grief and passion,
Grinding his teeth, and plucking off his hair,
Sate overwhelm'd with sorrow and dispair:
Then bids his servant Artabasus true,
Look to himself, and leave him to that crew,
Who was of hopes and comforts quite bereft,
And by his guard and Servitors all left.
Straight Bessus comes, & with his trait'rous hands
Throws him into a Cart, covered with hides,
Who wanting means t'resist these wrongs abides,
Then draws the cart along with chains of gold,
In more despight the thraled prince to hold,
And thus t'ward Alexander on he goes,
Great recompence for this, he did propose:
But some detesting this his wicked fact,
To Alexander flyes and tells this act,
Who doubling of his march, posts on amain,
Darius from that traitors hands to gain.
Bessus gets knowledg his disloyalty
Had Alexanders wrath incensed high,
Whose army now was almost within sight,
His hopes being dasht prepares himself for flight:
Unto Darius first he brings a horse,
And bids him save himself by speedy course:
The wofull King his courtesie refuses,
Whom thus the execrable wretch abuses,
By throwing darts gave him his mortal wound,
Then slew his Servants that were faithfull found,
Yea wounds the beasts that drew him unto death,
And leaves him thus to gasp out his last breath.
Bessus his partner in this tragedy,
Was the false Governour of Media.
This done, they with their host soon speed away,
To hide themselves remote in Bactria.
Darius bath'd in blood, sends out his groans,
Invokes the heav'ns and earth to hear his moans:
His lost felicity did grieve him sore,
But this unheard of treachery much more:
But above all, that neither Ear nor Eye
Should hear nor see his dying misery;
As thus he lay, Polistrates a Greek,
Wearied with his long march, did water seek,
So chanc'd these bloudy Horses to espy,
Whose wounds had made their skins of purple dye
To them repairs then looking in the Cart,
Finds poor Darius pierced to the heart,
Who not a little chear'd to have some eye,
The witness of this horrid Tragedy;
Prays him to Alexander to commend
The just revenge of this his woful end:
And not to pardon such disloyalty,
Of Treason, Murther, and base Cruelty.
If not, because Darius thus did pray,
Yet that succeeding Kings in safety may
Their lives enjoy, their Crowns and dignity,
And not by Traitors hands untimely dye.
He also sends his humble thankfulness,
For all the Kingly grace he did express;
To's Mother, Children dear, and wife now gone.
Which made their long restraint seem to be none:
Might be subjected to his royal hand,
And that his Rule as far extended be,
As men the rising, setting Sun shall see,
This said, the Greek for water doth intreat,
To quench his thirst, and to allay his heat:
Of all good things (quoth he) once in my power,
I've nothing left, at this my dying hour;
Thy service and compassion to reward,
But Alexander will, for this regard.
This said, his fainting breath did fleet away,
And though a Monarch late, now lyes like clay;
And thus must every Son of Adam lye,
Now to the East, great Alexander goes,
To see if any dare his might oppose,
For scarce the world or any bounds thereon,
Could bound his boundless fond Ambition;
Such as submits again he doth restore
Their riches, and their honours he makes more,
On Artabaces more then all bestow'd,
For his fidelity to's Master show'd.
Her Train to Alexander, (as 'tis thought.)
Though most of reading best and soundest mind,
Such Country there, nor yet such people find.
Then tell her errand, we had better spare
To th'ignorant, her title will declare:
As Alexander in his greatness grows,
So dayly of his virtues doth he lose.
He baseness counts, his former Clemency,
And not beseeming such a dignity;
His past sobriety doth also bate,
As most incompatible to his State;
His temperance is but a sordid thing,
No wayes becoming such a mighty King;
His greatness now he takes to represent
And such as shew'd but reverence before,
Now are commanded strictly to adore;
With Persian Robes himself doth dignifie,
Charging the same on his nobility,
His manners habit, gestures, all did fashion
After that conquer'd and luxurious Nation.
His Captains that were virtuously inclin'd,
Griev'd at this change of manners and of mind.
The ruder sort did openly deride,
His feigned Diety and foolish pride;
The certainty of both comes to his Ears,
But yet no notice takes of what he hears:
With those of worth he still desires esteem,
So heaps up gifts his credit to redeem
And for the rest new wars and travails finds,
That other matters might take up their minds,
And hearing Bessus, makes himself a King,
Intends that Traitor to his end to bring.
Now that his Host from luggage might be free,
And with his burthen no man burthened be;
Commands forthwith each man his fardle bring,
Into the market place before the King;
VVhich done, sets fire upon those goodly spoyles,
The recompence of travails wars and toyles.
And thus unwisely in a mading fume,
The wealth of many Kingdomes did consume,
But marvell 'tis that without mutiny,
The Souldiers should let pass this injury;
Nor wonder less to Readers may it bring,
Here to observe the rashness of the King.
Now with his Army doth he post away
False Bessus to find out in Bactria:
But much distrest for water in their march,
The drought and heat their bodies sore did parch.
At length they came to th'river Oxus brink,
Where so immoderately these thirsty drink,
Which more mortality to them did bring,
Then all their warrs against the Persian King.
Here Alexander's almost at a stand,
To pass the River to the other land.
For boats here's none, nor near it any wood,
To make them Rafts to waft them o're the flood:
But he that was resolved in his mind,
Would without means some transportation find.
Then from the Carriages the hides he takes,
And stuffing them with straw, he bundles makes.
On these together ti'd, in six dayes space,
They all pass over to the other place.
Had Bessus had but valour to his will,
With little pain there might have kept them still:
But Coward durst not fight, nor could he fly,
Hated of all for's former treachery,
Is by his own now bound in iron chains,
A Coller of the same, his neck contains.
And in this sort they rather drag then bring
This Malefactor vile before the King,
Who to Darius brother gives the wretch,
With racks and tortures every limb to stretch.
Here was of Greeks a town in Bactria,
Whom Xerxes from their Country led away,
These not a little joy'd, this day to see,
Wherein their own had got the sov'raignty
And now reviv'd, with hopes held up their head
From bondage long to be Enfranchised.
But Alexander puts them to the sword
Without least cause from them in deed or word;
Nor Sex, nor age, nor one, nor other spar'd,
But in his cruelty alike they shar'd:
Nor reason could he give for this great wrong,
But that they had forgot their mother tongue.
While thus some time he spent in Bactria,
And in his camp strong and securely lay,
Down from the mountains twenty thousand came
And there most fiercely set upon the same:
Repelling these, two marks of honour got
Imprinted in his leg, by arrows shot.
The Bactrians against him now rebel;
But he their stubborness in time doth quell.
From hence he to Jaxartis River goes,
Where Scythians rude his army doth oppose,
And with their outcryes in an hideous sort
Beset his camp, or military court,
Of darts and arrows, made so little spare,
They flew so thick, they seem'd to dark the air:
But soon his souldiers forc'd them to a flight,
Their nakedness could not endure their might.
Upon this rivers bank in seventeen dayes
A goodly City doth compleatly raise,
Which Alexandria he doth likewise name,
And sixty furlongs could but round the same.
A third Supply Antipater now sent,
Which did his former forces much augment;
And being one hundred twenty thousand strong;
He enters then the Indian Kings among:
Those that submit, he gives them rule again,
Such as do not, both them and theirs are slain.
His warrs with sundry nations I'le omit,
And also of the Mallians what is writ.
His Fights, his dangers, and the hurts he had,
How to submit their necks at last they're glad.
To Nisa goes by Bacchus built long since,
Whose feasts are celebrated by this prince;
Nor had that drunken god one who would take
His Liquors more devoutly for his sake.
When thus ten days his brain with wine he'd soakt,
And with delicious meats his palate choakt:
To th'River Indus next his course he bends,
Boats to prepare, Ephestion first he sends,
Had to his mind made all things to accord,
The vessels ready were at his command,
And Omphis King of that part of the land,
Through his perswasion Alexander meets,
Fifty six Elephants he brings to's hand,
And tenders him the strength of all his land;
Presents himself first with a golden crown,
Then eighty talents to his captains down:
But Alexander made him to behold
He glory sought, no silver nor no gold;
His presents all with thanks he did restore,
And of his own a thousand talents more.
Thus all the Indian Kings to him submit,
But Porus stout, who will not yeild as yet:
To him doth Alexander thus declare,
His pleasure is that forthwith he repair
Unto his Kingdomes borders, and as due,
His homage to himself as Soveraign doe:
But kingly Porus this brave answer sent,
That to attend him there was his intent,
And come as well provided as he could,
But for the rest, his sword advise him should.
Great Alexander vext at this reply,
Did more his valour then his crown envy,
Is now resolv'd to pass Hydaspes flood,
And there by force his soveraignty make good.
Stout Porus on the banks doth ready stand
To give him welcome when he comes to land.
A potent army with him like a King,
And ninety Elephants for warr did bring:
Had Alexander such resistance seen
On Tygris side, here now he had not been.
Within this spacious River deep and wide
Did here and there Isles full of trees abide.
His army Alexander doth divide
With Ptolemy sends part to th'other side;
Porus encounters them and thinks all's there,
When covertly the rest get o're else where,
And whilst the first he valiantly assail'd,
The last set on his back, and so prevail'd.
Yet work enough here Alexander found,
For to the last stout Porus kept his ground:
Nor was't dishonour at the length to yield,
When Alexander strives to win the field.
The kingly Captive 'fore the Victor's brought,
In looks or gesture not abased ought,
But him a Prince of an undaunted mind
Did Alexander by his answers find:
His fortitude his royal foe commends,
Restores him and his bounds farther extends.
Now eastward Alexander would goe still,
But so to doe his souldiers had no will,
Long with excessive travails wearied,
Could by no means be farther drawn or led,
Yet that his fame might to posterity
Be had in everlasting memory,
Doth for his Camp a greater circuit take,
And for his souldiers larger Cabbins make.
His mangers he erected up so high
As never horse his Provender could eye.
Huge bridles made, which here and there he left,
Which might be found, and for great wonders kept
Twelve altars then for monuments he rears,
Whereon his acts and travels long appears.
But doubting wearing time might these decay,
And so his memory would fade away,
He on the fair Hydaspes pleasant side,
Two Cities built, his name might there abide,
First Nicea, the next Bucephalon,
Where he entomb'd his stately Stalion.
His fourth and last supply was hither sent,
Then down Hydaspes with his Fleet he went;
Some time he after spent upon that shore,
Whether Ambassadors, ninety or more,
Came with submission from the Indian Kings,
Bringing their presents rare, and precious things,
These all he feasts in state on beds of gold,
His Furniture most sumptuous to behold;
His meat & drink, attendants, every thing,
To th'utmost shew'd the glory of a King.
With rich rewards he sent them home again,
Acknowledged their Masters sovereign;
Then sailing South, and coming to that shore,
Those obscure Nations yielded as before:
A City here he built, call'd by his Name,
Which could not sound too oft with too much fame
Then sailing by the mouth of Indus floud,
His Gallyes stuck upon the flats and mud;
Which the stout Macedonians amazed sore,
Depriv'd at once the use of Sail and Oar:
Observing well the nature of the Tide,
In those their fears they did not long abide.
Passing fair Indus mouth his course he steer'd
To th'coast which by Euphrates mouth appear'd;
Whose inlets near unto, he winter spent,
Unto his starved Souldiers small content,
By hunger and by cold so many slain,
That of them all the fourth did scarce remain.
Thus winter, Souldiers, and provisions spent,
From hence he then unto Gedrosia went.
And thence he marcht into Carmania,
And so at length drew near to Persia,
Now through these goodly Countryes as he past,
Much time in feasts and ryoting did waste;
Then visits Cyrus Sepulchre in's way,
Who now obscure at Passagardis lay:
Upon his Monument his Robe he spread,
And set his Crown on his supposed head.
From hence to Babylon, some time there spent,
He at the last to royal Shushan went;
A wedding Feast to's Nobles then he makes,
And Statyra, Darius daughter takes,
Her Sister gives to his Ephestian dear,
That by this match he might be yet more near;
He fourscore Persian Ladies also gave,
At this same time unto his Captains brave:
Six thousand guests unto this Feast invites,
Whose Sences all were glutted with delights.
It far exceeds my mean abilities
To shadow forth these short felicities,
Spectators here could scarce relate the story,
They were so rapt with this external glory:
If an Ideal Paradise a man would frame,
He might this Feast imagine by the same;
To every guess a cup of gold he sends,
So after many dayes the Banquet ends.
Now Alexanders conquests all are done,
And his long Travails past and overgone;
His virtues dead, buried, and quite forgot,
But vice remains to his Eternal blot.
'Mongst those that of his cruelty did tast,
Philotus was not least, nor yet the last,
Accus'd because he did not certifie
The King of treason and conspiracy:
Upon suspition being apprehended,
Nothing was prov'd wherein he had offended
But silence, which was of such consequence,
He was judg'd guilty of the same offence,
But for his fathers great deserts the King
His royal pardon gave for this foul thing.
Yet is Phylotas unto judgment brought,
Must suffer, not for what is prov'd, but thought.
His master is accuser, judge and King,
Who to the height doth aggravate each thing,
Inveighs against his father now absent,
And's brethren who for him their lives had spent.
But Philotas his unpardonable crime,
No merit could obliterate, or time:
He did the Oracle of Jove deride,
By which his Majesty was diefi'd.
Philotas thus o'recharg'd with wrong and grief
Sunk in despair without hope of Relief,
Fain would have spoke and made his own defence,
The King would give no ear, but went from thence
To his malicious Foes delivers him,
To wreak their spight and hate on every limb.
Philotas after him sends out this cry,
O Alexander, thy free clemency
My foes exceeds in malice, and their hate
Thy kingly word can easily terminate.
Such torments great as wit could worst invent,
Or flesh and life could bear, till both were spent
Were now inflicted on Parmenio's son
He might accuse himself, as they had done,
At last he did, so they were justifi'd,
And told the world, that for his guilt he di'd.
But how these Captains should, or yet their master
Look on Parmenio, after this disaster
They knew not, wherefore best now to be done,
Was to dispatch the father as the son.
This sound advice at heart pleas'd Alexander,
Who was so much ingag'd to this Commander,
As he would ne're confess, nor yet reward,
Nor could his Captains bear so great regard:
Wherefore at once, all these to satisfie,
It was decreed Parmenio should dye:
Polidamus, who seem'd Parmenio's friend
To do this deed they into Media send:
He walking in his garden to and fro,
Fearing no harm, because he none did doe,
Most wickedly was slain without least crime,
(The most renowned captain of his time)
This is Parmenio who so much had done
For Philip dead, and his surviving son,
Who from a petty King of Macedon 
By him was set upon the Persian throne,
This that Parmenio who still overcame,
Yet gave his Master the immortal fame,
Who for his prudence, valour, care and trust
Had this reward, most cruel and unjust.
The next, who in untimely death had part,
Was one of more esteem, but less desert;
Clitus belov'd next to Ephestian,
And in his cups his chief companion;
When both were drunk, Clitus was wont to jeer,
Alexander to rage, to kill, and swear;
Nothing more pleasing to mad Clitus tongue,
Nothing toucht Alexander to the quick,
Like this against his Diety to kick:
Both at a Feast when they had tippled well,
Upon this dangerous Theam fond Clitus fell;
From jest to earnest, and at last so bold,
That of Parmenio's death him plainly told.
Which Alexanders wrath incens'd so high,
Nought but his life for this could satisfie;
From one stood by he snatcht a partizan,
And in a rage him through the body ran,
Next day he tore his face for what he'd done,
And would have slain himself for Clitus gone:
This pot Companion he did more bemoan,
Then all the wrongs to brave Parmenio done.
The next of worth that suffered after these,
Was learned, virtuous, wise Calisthenes,
VVho lov'd his Master more then did the rest,
As did appear, in flattering him the least;
Nor would adore him for a Diety:
For this alone and for no other cause,
Against his Sovereign, or against his Laws,
He on the Rack his Limbs in pieces rent,
Thus was he tortur'd till his life was spent.
Of this unkingly act doth Seneca 
This censure pass, and not unwisely say,
Of Alexander this th'eternal crime,
VVhich shall not be obliterate by time.
VVhich virtues fame can ne're redeem by far,
Nor all felicity of his in war.
VVhen e're 'tis said he thousand thousands slew,
Yea, and Calisthenes to death he drew.
The mighty Persian King he overcame,
Yea, and he kill'd Calistthenes of fame.
All Countryes, Kingdomes, Provinces, he wan
From Hellispont, to th'farthest Ocean.
All this he did, who knows' not to be true?
But yet withal, Catisthenes he slew.
From Macedon, his Empire did extend
Unto the utmost bounds o' th'orient:
All this he did, yea, and much more, 'tis true,
But yet withal, Catisthenes he slew.
Now Alexander goes to Media,
Finds there the want of wise Parmenio;
Here his chief favourite Ephestian dies,
He celebrates his mournful obsequies:
Hangs his Physitian, the Reason why
He suffered, his friend Ephestian dye.
To punish where himself deserved blame;
Or of necessity he must imply,
The other was the greatest Diety.
The Mules and Horses are for sorrow shorne,
The battlements from off the walls are torne.
Of stately Ecbatane who now must shew,
A rueful face in this so general woe;
Twelve thousand Talents also did intend,
Upon a sumptuous monument to spend:
What e're he did, or thought not so content,
His messenger to Jupiter he sent,
That by his leave his friend Ephestion,
From Media to Babylon he went,
To meet him there t'Antipater he'd sent,
That he might act also upon the Stage,
And in a Tragedy there end his age.
Not suffering her to meddle with the State,
And by her Letters did her Son incite,
This great indignity he should requite;
His doing so, no whit displeas'd the King,
Though to his Mother he disprov'd the thing.
But now Antipater had liv'd so long,
He might well dye though he had done no wrong;
His service great is suddenly forgot,
Or if remembred, yet regarded not:
The King doth intimate 'twas his intent,
His honours and his riches to augment;
Of larger Provinces the rule to give,
And for his Counsel near the King to live.
So to be caught, Antipater's too wise,
Parmenio's death's too fresh before his eyes;
He was too subtil for his crafty foe.
Nor by his baits could be insnared so:
But his excuse with humble thanks he sends,
His Age and journy long he then pretends;
And pardon craves for his unwilling stay,
He shews his grief, he's forc'd to disobey.
Before his Answer came to Babylon,
The thread of Alexanders life was spun;
Poyson had put an end to's dayes ('twas thought)
By Philip and Cassander to him brought,
Sons to Antipater, and bearers of his Cup,
Lest of such like their Father chance to sup;
By others thought, and that more generally,
That through excessive drinking he did dye:
The thirty third of's Age do all agree,
This Conquerour did yield to destiny.
When this sad news came to Darius Mother,
She laid it more to heart, then any other,
Nor meat, nor drink, nor comfort would she take,
But pin'd in grief till life did her forsake;
All friends she shuns, yea, banished the light,
Till death inwrapt her in perpetual night.
This Monarchs fame must last whilst world doth stand,
And Conquests be talkt of whilest there is land;
His Princely qualities had he retain'd,
Unparalled for ever had remain'd.
But with the world his virtues overcame,
And so with black beclouded, all his fame;
Wise Aristotle Tutor to his youth.
Had so instructed him in moral Truth:
The principles of what he then had learn'd
Might to the last (when sober) be discern'd.
Learning and learned men he much regarded,
And curious Artist evermore rewarded:
The Illiads of Homer he still kept.
And under's pillow laid them when he slept.
Achilles happiness he did envy,
'Cause Homer kept his acts to memory.
Profusely bountifull without desert,
For such as pleas'd him had both wealth and heart
Cruel by nature and by custome too,
As oft his acts throughout his reign doth shew:
Ambitious so, that nought could satisfie,
Vain, thirsting after immortality,
Still fearing that his name might hap to dye,
And fame not last unto eternity.
This Conqueror did oft lament (tis said)
There were no more worlds to be conquered.
This folly great Augustus did deride,
For had he had but wisdome to his pride,
He would had found enough there to be done,
To govern that he had already won.
His thoughts are perisht, he aspires no more,
Nor can he kill or save as heretofore.
Now like a mortal helpless man he lyes.
Of all those Kingdomes large which he had got,
To his Posterity remain'd no jot;
For by that hand which still revengeth bloud,
None of his kindred, nor his race long stood:
But as he took delight much bloud to spill,
So the same cup to his, did others fill.
Four of his Captains now do all divide,
As Daniel before had prophysi'd.
The Leopard down, the four wings 'gan to rise,
The great horn broke, the less did tyranize.
What troubles and contentions did ensue
We may hereafter shew in season due.
Aridaeus.
Great Alexander dead, his Armyes left,
Like to that Giant of his Eye bereft;
When of his monstrous bulk it was the guide,
His matchless force no creature could abide.
But by Ulisses having lost his sight,
All men began streight to contemn his might;
For aiming still amiss, his dreadful blows
Did harm himself, but never reacht his Foes.
Now Court and Camp all in confusion be,
A King they'l have, but who, none can agree;
Each Captain wisht this prize to bear away,
But none so hardy found as so durst say:
Great Alexander did leave Issue none,
Except by Artabasus daughter one;
And Roxane fair whom late he married,
Was near her time to be delivered.
By natures right these had enough to claim,
But meaness of their mothers bar'd the same,
Alledg'd by those who by their subtile Plea
Had hope themselves to bear the Crown away.
A Sister Alexander had, but she
Claim'd not, perhaps, her Sex might hindrance be.
After much tumult they at last proclaim'd
His base born brother Aridaeus nam'd,
That so under his feeble wit and reign,
Their ends they might the better still attain.
This choice Perdiccas vehemently disclaim'd,
And Babe unborn of Roxane he proclaim'd;
Some wished him to take the style of King,
Because his Master gave to him his Ring,
And had to him still since Ephestion di'd
More then to th'rest his favour testifi'd.
But he refus'd, with feigned modesty,
Hoping to be elect more generally.
He hold on this occasion should have laid,
For second offer there was never made.
'Mongst these contentions, tumults, jealousies,
Seven dayes the corps of their great master lies
Untoucht, uncovered slighted and neglected,
So much these princes their own ends respected:
A Contemplation to astonish Kings,
That he who late possest all earthly things,
And yet not so content unless that he
Might be esteemed for a Diety;
Now lay a Spectacle to testifie,
The wretchedness of mans mortality.
After some time, when stirs began to calm,
His body did the Egyptians embalme;
His countenance so lively did appear,
That for a while they durst not come so near:
No sign of poyson in his intrails sound,
But all his bowels coloured, well and sound.
Perdiccas seeing Arideus must be King,
Under his name began to rule each thing.
His chief Opponent who Control'd his sway,
Was Meleager whom he would take away,
And by a wile he got him in his power,
So took his life unworthily that hour.
Using the name, and the command of th'King
To authorize his acts in every thing.
The princes seeing Perdiccas power and pride,
For their security did now provide.
Antigonus for his share Asia takes,
And Ptolemy next sure of Egypt makes:
Seleucus afterward held Babylon,
Antipater had long rul'd Macedon.
These now to govern for the king pretends,
But nothing less each one himself intends.
Perdiccas took no province like the rest,
But held command of th'Army (which was best)
And had a higher project in his head,
His Masters sister secretly to wed:
So to the Lady, covertly he sent,
(That none might know, to frustrate his intent)
But Cleopatra this Suitor did deny,
For Leonatus more lovely in her eye,
To whom she sent a message of her mind,
That if he came good welcome he should find.
In these tumultuous dayes the thralled Greeks,
Their Ancient Liberty afresh now seeks.
And gladly would the yoke shake off, laid on
Sometimes by Philip and his conquering son.
The Athenians force Antipater to fly
To Lamia where he shut up doth lye.
To brave Craterus then he sends with speed
For succours to relieve him in his need.
The like of Leonatus he requires,
(Which at this time well suited his desires)
For to Antipater he now might goe,
His Lady take in th'way, and no man know.
Antiphilus the Athenian General
With speed his Army doth together call;
And Leonatus seeks to stop, that so
He joyne not with Antipater their foe.
The Athenian Army was the greater far,
(Which did his Match with Cleopatra mar)
For fighting still, while there did hope remain
The valiant Chief amidst his foes was slain.
'Mongst all the princes of great Alexander 
For personage, none like to this Commander.
Now to Antipater Craterus goes,
Blockt up in Lamia still by his foes,
Long marches through Cilicia he makes,
And the remains of Leonatus takes:
With them and his he into Grecia went,
Antipater releas'd from prisonment:
After which time the Greeks did never more
Act any thing of worth, as heretofore:
But under servitude their necks remain'd,
Nor former liberty or glory gain'd.
Now di'd about the end of th'Lamian war
Demosthenes, that sweet-tongue'd Orator,
Who fear'd Antipater would take his life
For animating the Athenian strife:
To end his dayes by poison rather chose
Then fall into the hands of mortal foes.
Craterus and Antipater now joyne,
In love and in affinity combine,
Craterus doth his daughter Phila wed
Their friendship might the more be strengthened.
Whilst they in Macedon do thus agree,
In Asia they all asunder be.
Perdiccas griev'd to see the princes bold
So many Kingdomes in their power to hold,
Yet to regain them, how he did not know,
His souldiers 'gainst those captains would not goe
To suffer them go on as they begun,
Was to give way himself might be undone.
With Antipater to joyne he sometimes thought,
That by his help, the rest might low be brought,
But this again dislikes; he would remain,
If not in stile, in deed a soveraign;
(For all the princes of great Alexander 
Acknowledged for Chief that old Commander)
Desires the King to goe to Macedon,
Which once was of his Ancestors the throne,
And by his presence there to nullifie
The acts of his Vice-Roy now grown so high.
Antigonus of treason first attaints,
And summons him to answer his complaints.
This he avoids, and ships himself and son,
goes to Antipater and tells what's done.
He and Craterus, both with him do joyne,
And 'gainst Perdiccas all their strength combine.
Brave Ptolemy, to make a fourth then sent
To save himself from danger imminent.
In midst of these garboyles, with wondrous state
His masters funeral doth celebrate:
In Alexandria his tomb he plac'd,
Which eating time hath scarcely yet defac'd.
Two years and more, since natures debt he paid,
And yet till now at quiet was not laid.
Great love did Ptolemy by this act gain,
And made the souldiers on his side remain.
Perdiccas hears his foes are all combin'd,
'Gainst which to goe, is not resolv'd in mind.
But first 'gainst Ptolemy he judg'd was best,
Neer'st unto him, and farthest from the rest,
Leaves Eumenes the Asian Coast to free
From the invasions of the other three,
And with his army unto Egypt goes
Brave Ptolemy to th'utmost to oppose.
Perdiccas surly cariage, and his pride
Did alinate the souldiers from his side.
But Ptolemy by affability
His sweet demeanour and his courtesie,
Did make his own, firm to his cause remain,
And from the other side did dayly gain.
Perdiccas in his pride did ill intreat
Python of haughty mind, and courage great.
Who could not brook so great indignity,
But of his wrongs his friends doth certifie;
The souldiers 'gainst Perdiccas they incense,
Who vow to make this captain recompence,
And in a rage they rush into his tent,
Knock out his brains: to Ptolemy then went
And offer him his honours, and his place,
With stile of the Protector, him to grace.
Next day into the camp came Ptolemy,
And is receiv'd of all most joyfully.
Their proffers he refus'd with modesty,
Yields them to Python for his courtesie.
With what he held he was now more content,
Then by more trouble to grow eminent.
Now comes there news of a great victory
That Eumenes got of the other three.
Had it but in Perdiccas life ariv'd,
With greater joy it would have been receiv'd.
Thus Ptolemy rich Egypt did retain,
And Python turn'd to Asia again.
Whilst Perdiccas encamp'd in Affrica,
Antigonus did enter Asia,
And fain would Eumenes draw to their side,
But he alone most faithfull did abide:
The other all had Kingdomes in their eye,
But he was true to's masters family,
Nor could Craterus, whom he much did love.
From his fidelity once make him move:
Two Battles fought, and had of both the best,
And brave Craterus slew among the rest:
For this sad strife he poures out his complaints,
And his beloved foe full sore laments.
I should but snip a story into bits
And his great Acts and glory much eclipse,
To shew the dangers Eumenes befel,
His stratagems wherein he did excel:
His Policies, how he did extricate
Himself from out of Lab'rinths intricate:
He that at large would satisfie his mind,
In Plutarchs Lives his history may find.
For all that should be said, let this suffice,
He was both valiant, faithfull, patient, wise.
Python now chose Protector of the state,
Sees Arrideus must not King it long,
If once young Alexander grow more strong,
But that her husband serve for supplement,
To warm his seat, was never her intent.
She knew her birth-right gave her Macedon,
Grand-child to him who once sat on that throne
Who was Perdiccas, Philips eldest brother,
She daughter to his son, who had no other.
Pythons commands, as oft she countermands;
What he appoints, she purposely withstands.
He wearied out at last would needs be gone,
Resign'd his place, and so let all alone:
In's room the souldiers chose Antipater,
From Macedon to Asia he came,
That he might settle matters in the same.
He plac'd, displac'd, control'd rul'd as he list,
And this no man durst question or resist;
For all the nobles of King Alexander 
Their bonnets vail'd to him as chief Commander.
When to his pleasure all things they had done,
Two sons of Alexander, and the rest,
All to be order'd there as he thought best.
The Army to Antigonus doth leave,
And Government of Asia to him gave.
And thus Antipater the ground-work layes,
On which Antigonus his height doth raise,
Who in few years, the rest so overtops,
For universal Monarchy he hopes.
With Eumenes he diverse Battels fought,
And by his slights to circumvent him sought:
But vain it was to use his policy,
'Gainst him that all deceits could scan and try.
In this Epitome too long to tell
How finely Eumenes did here excell,
And by the self same Traps the other laid,
He to his cost was righteously repaid.
But while these Chieftains doe in Asia fight,
To Greece and Macedon lets turn our sight.
When great Antipater the world must leave,
His place to Polisperchon did bequeath,
Fearing his son Cassander was unstaid,
Too rash to bear that charge, if on him laid.
Antigonus hearing of his decease
On most part of Assyria doth seize.
And Ptolemy next to incroach begins,
All Syria and Phenicia he wins,
Then Polisperchon 'gins to act in's place,
Recalls Olimpias the Court to grace.
Antipater had banish'd her from thence
Into Epire for her great turbulence;
This new Protector's of another mind,
Thinks by her Majesty much help to find.
Cassander like his Father could not see,
This Polisperchons great ability,
Slights his Commands, his actions he disclaims,
And to be chief himself now bends his aims;
Such as his Father had advanc'd to place,
Or by his favours any way had grac'd
Are now at the devotion of the Son,
Prest to accomplish what he would have done;
On whom (t'was thought) she set her chief delight:
Unto these helps at home he seeks out more,
Goes to Antigonus and doth implore,
By all the Bonds 'twixt him and's Father past,
And for that great gift which he gave him last.
By these and all to grant him some supply,
To take down Polisperchon grown so high;
For this Antigonus did need no spurs,
Hoping to gain yet more by these new stirs,
Streight furnish'd him with a sufficient aid,
And so he quick returns thus well appaid,
With Ships at Sea, an Army for the Land,
His proud opponent hopes soon to withstand.
But in his absence Polisperchon takes
Such friends away as for his Interest makes
By death, by prison, or by banishment,
That no supply by these here might be lent,
Cassander with his Host to Grecia goes,
Whom Polisperchon labours to oppose;
But beaten was at Sea, and foil'd at Land,
Cassanders forces had the upper hand,
Athens with many Towns in Greece beside,
Firm (for his Fathers sake) to him abide.
Whil'st hot in wars these two in Greece remain,
Antigonus doth all in Asia gain;
Still labours Eumenes, would with him side,
But all in vain, he faithful did abide:
Nor Mother could, nor Sons of Alexander,
Put trust in any but in this Commander.
The great ones now began to shew their mind,
And act as opportunity they find.
Aridaeus the scorn'd and simple King,
More then he bidden was could act no thing.
Polisperchon for office hoping long,
Thinks to inthrone the Prince when riper grown;
Euridice this injury disdains,
And to Cassandar of this wrong complains.
Hateful the name and house of Alexander,
Was to this proud vindicative Cassander;
He still kept lockt within his memory,
His Fathers danger, with his Family;
Nor thought he that indignity was small,
When Alexander knockt his head to th'wall.
Did make him vow her servant to be seen.
Olimpias, Aridaeus deadly hates,
As all her Husbands, Children by his mates,
She gave him poyson formerly ('tis thought)
Which damage both to mind and body brought;
She now with Polisperchon doth combine,
To make the King by force his Seat resigne:
And her young grand-child in his State inthrone,
That under him, she might rule, all alone.
For aid she goes t'Epire among her friends,
The better to accomplish these her ends;
Euridice hearing what she intends,
In haste unto her friend Cassander sends,
To leave his siege at Tegea, and with speed,
To save the King and her in this their need:
Then by intreaties, promises and Coyne,
Some forces did procure with her to joyn.
Olimpias soon enters Macedon,
Calling to mind what sometime she had been;
The wife and Mother of their famous Kings,
Nor darts, nor arrows, now none shoots or flings.
To save their lives t'Amphipolis do fly;
And needs will have their lives as well as State:
The King by extream torments had his end,
A Halter, cup of poyson, and a Sword,
Bids chuse her death, such kindness she'l afford.
At length yields to the Halter her fair neck;
Praying that fatal day might quickly haste,
On which Olimpias of the like might taste.
'Gainst all that lov'd Cassander she was bent;
His Brethren, Kinsfolk and his chiefest friends,
That fell within her reach came to their ends:
Dig'd up his brother dead, 'gainst natures right,
And threw his bones about to shew her spight:
The Courtiers wondring at her furious mind,
Wisht in Epire she had been still confin'd.
In Peloponesus then Cassander lay,
Where hearing of this news he speeds away,
With rage, and with revenge he's hurried on,
But being stopt, at streight Thermopoly,
Sea passage gets, and lands in Thessaly:
His Army he divides, sends post away,
Polisperchon to hold a while in play;
And with the rest Olimpias pursues,
For all her cruelty, to give her dues.
She with the chief o' th'Court to Pydna flyes,
Well fortifi'd, (and on the Sea it lyes)
There by Cassander she's blockt up so long,
Untill the Famine grows exceeding strong,
Her Couzen of Epire did what he might,
To raise the Siege, and put her Foes to flight.
Cassander is resolved there to remain,
So succours and endeavours proves but vain;
Her foe would give no Ear, (such is his hate)
The Souldiers pinched with this scarcity,
By stealth unto Cassander dayly fly;
Olimpias means to hold out to the last,
Expecting nothing but of death to tast:
But his occasions calling him away,
Gives promise for her life, so wins the day.
No sooner had he got her in his hand,
But made in judgement her accusers stand;
And plead the blood of friends and kindreds spilt,
Desiring justice might be done for guilt;
And so was he acquitted of his word,
For justice sake she being put to th'Sword:
Whose fury scarcely parallel'd hath been.
The daughter, sister, Mother, Wife to Kings,
But Royalty no good conditions brings;
To Husbands death ('tis thought) she gave consent,
The murtherer she did so much lament:
With Garlands crown'd his head, bemoan'd his fates,
His Sword unto Apollo consecrates.
Her Outrages too tedious to relate,
How for no cause but her inveterate hate;
Her Husbands wives and Children after's death,
Some slew, some fry'd, of others stopt the breath:
Now in her Age she's forc'd to tast that Cup,
Which she had others often made to sup.
Now many Towns in Macedon supprest,
And Pellas fain to yield among the rest;
The Funerals Cassander celebrates,
Among their Ancestors by him they're laid,
And shews of lamentation for them made.
Old Thebes he then rebuilt so much of fame,
And Cassandria rais'd after his name.
But leave him building, others in their Urne,
Let's for a while, now into Asia turn.
True Eumenes endeavours by all Skill,
To keep Antigonus from Shushan still;
Having command o'th' Treasure he can hire,
Such as no threats, nor favour could acquire.
In divers Battels he had good success,
Antigonus came off still honourless;
When Victor oft he'd been, and so might still,
Peucestes did betray him by a wile.
T'Antigonus, who took his Life unjust,
Because he never would forgoe his trust;
Thus lost he all for his fidelity,
Striving t'uphold his Masters Family.
But to a period as that did haste,
So Eumenes (the prop) of death must tast;
All Persia now Antigonus doth gain,
And Master of the Treasure sole remain:
Then with Seleucus streight at odds doth fall,
And he for aid to Ptolomy doth call,
The Princes all begin now to envy
Antigonus, he growing up so high;
Fearing his force, and what might hap e're long,
Enters into a Combination strong,
Seleucus, Ptolemy, Cassander joynes,
Lysimachus to make a fourth combines:
Antigonus desirous of the Greeks,
To make Cassander odious to them seeks,
Sends forth his declarations near and far,
And clears what cause he had to make this war,
Cassanders outrages at large doth tell,
Shews his ambitious practises as well.
The mother of their King to death he'd put,
His wife and son in prison close had shut:
And aiming now to make himself a king,
And that some title he might seem to bring,
Thessalonica he had newly wed,
Daughter to Philip their renowned head:
Had built and call'd a City by his name,
Which none e're did, but those of royal fame:
And in despight of their two famous Kings
Hatefull Olinthians to Greece rebrings.
Rebellious Thebes he had reedified,
Which their late King in dust had damnified,
Requires them therefore to take up their arms
And to requite this traitor for these harms.
Then Ptolemy would gain the Greeks likewise,
And he declares the others injuryes:
First how he held the Empire in his hands,
Seleucus driven from Goverment and lands,
The valiant Eumenes unjustly slain,
Therefore requests their help to take him down
Before he wear the universal Crown.
These princes at the sea soon had a fight,
Where great Antigonus was put to flight:
His son at Gaza likewise lost the field,
So Syria to Ptolemy did yield:
And Seleucus recovers Babylon,
Still gaining Countryes eastward he goes on.
Demetrius with Ptolemy did fight,
And coming unawares, put him to flight;
But bravely sends the prisoners back again,
With all the spoyle and booty he had tane.
Courteous as noble Ptolemy, or more,
VVho at Gaza did the like to him before.
Antigonus did much rejoyce, his son
VVith victory, his lost repute had won.
At last these princes tired out with warrs,
Sought for a peace, and laid aside their jarrs:
The terms of their agreement, thus express
That each should hold what now he did possess,
Till Alexander unto age was grown,
VVho then should be enstalled in the throne.
This toucht Cassander sore for what he'd done,
Imprisoning both the mother and the son:
He sees the Greeks now favour their young Prince
Whom he in durance held, now, and long since,
That in few years he must be forc'd or glad,
To render up such Kingdomes as he had;
Resolves to quit his fears by one deed done,
So puts to death the Mother and her Son.
This Roxane for her beauty all commend,
But for one act she did, just was her end.
No sooner was great Alexander dead,
But she Darius daughters murthered.
Both thrown into a well to hide her blot,
Perdiccas was her Partner in this plot.
The heavens seem'd slow in paying her the same;
But at the last the hand of vengeance came.
And for that double fact which she had done,
The life of her must goe, and of her son
Perdiccas had before for his amiss,
But by their hands who thought not once of this.
Cassanders deed the princes do detest,
But 'twas in shew; in heart it pleas'd them best.
That he is odious to the world, they'r glad:
When this foul tragedy was past and done,
Polysperchon brings the other son
Call'd Hercules, and elder then his brother,
(But Olimpias would prefer the other)
The Greeks toucht with the murther done of late,
This Orphan prince 'gan to compassionate,
Begin to mutter much 'gainst proud Cassander,
And place their hopes on th'heir of Alexander.
Cassander fear'd what might of this ensue,
So Polisperchon to his counsel drew,
And gives Peloponesus for his hire,
Who slew the prince according to desire.
Thus was the race and house of Alexander 
Extinct by this inhumane wretch Cassander.
Antigonus, for all this doth not mourn,
He knows to's profit, this at last will turn,
But that some Title now he might pretend,
To Cleopatra doth for marriage send;
Lysimachus and Ptolemy the same,
And lewd Cassander too, sticks not for shame:
She then in Lydia at Sardis lay,
Where by Embassage all these Princes pray.
Choice above all, of Ptolemy she makes,
With his Embassador her journy takes;
Antigonus Lieutenant stayes her still,
Untill he further know his Masters will:
Antigonus now had a Wolf by th'Ears,
To hold her still, or let her go he fears.
Resolves at last the Princess should be slain,
So hinders him of her, he could not gain;
Her women are appointed for this deed,
They for their great reward no better speed:
For by command, they streight were put to death,
As vile Conspirators that stopt her breath.
And now he hopes, he's order'd all so well,
The world must needs believe what he doth tell;
Thus Philips house was quite extinguished,
Except Cassanders wife who yet not dead.
And by their means who thought of nothing less,
Then vengeance just, against them to express;
Now blood was paid with blood for what was done
By cruel Father, Mother, cruel Son:
Thus may we hear, and fear, and ever say,
That hand is righteous still which doth repay.
These Captains now the stile of Kings do take,
For to their Crowns their's none can Title make;
Demetrius first the royal stile assum'd,
By his Example all the rest presum'd.
Antigonus himself to ingratiate,
Doth promise liberty to Athens State;
With Arms and with provision stores them well,
The better 'gainst Cassander to rebel.
Demetrius thether goes, is entertain'd
Most grosly base was their great Adulation,
Who Incense burnt, and offered oblation:
These Kings afresh fall to their wars again,
Demetrius of Ptolemy doth gain.
'Twould be an endless Story to relate
Their several Battels and their several fate,
Their fights by Sea, their victories by Land,
How some when down, straight got the upper hand
Antigonus and Seleucus then fight
Near Ephesus, each bringing all his might,
And he that Conquerour shall now remain,
This day 'twixt these two Kings ends all the strife,
For here Antigonus lost rule and life:
Nor to his Son, did e're one foot remain
Of those vast Kingdomes, he did sometimes gain.
Demetrius with his Troops to Athens flyes,
Hopes to find succours in his miseries;
But they adoring in prosperity,
Now shut their gates in his adversity:
He sorely griev'd at this his desperate State
Tryes Foes, sith friends will not compassionate.
His peace he then with old Seleucus makes,
Who his fair daughter Stratonica takes,
Antiochus, Seleucus, dear lov'd Son,
Is for this fresh young Lady quite undone;
Falls so extreamly sick, all fear'd his life,
Yet durst not say, he lov'd his Fathers wife,
When his disease the skill'd Physitian found,
His Fathers mind he wittily did sound,
Who did no sooner understand the same,
But willingly resign'd the beautious Dame:
Cassander now must dye his race is run,
And leaves the ill got Kingdomes he had won.
Two Sons he left, born of King Philips daughter,
Who had an end put to their dayes by slaughter;
Which should succeed at variance they fell,
The Mother would, the youngest might excell:
The eld'st inrag'd did play the Vipers part,
And with his Sword did run her through the heart:
Rather then Philips race should longer live,
He whom she gave his life her death shall give.
This by Lysimacus was after slain,
Whose daughter he not long before had ta'ne;
Demetrius is call'd in by th'youngest Son,
Against Lysimachus who from him won.
But he a Kingdome more then's friend did eye,
Seaz'd upon that, and slew him traitrously.
Thus Philips and Cassander's race both gone,
And so falls out to be extinct in one;
And though Cassander died in his bed,
His Seed to be extirpt, was destined;
For blood, which was decre'd that he should spill,
Yet must his Children pay for Fathers ill;
Jehu in killing Ahab's house did well,
Yet be aveng'd must blood of Jezerel.
Demetrius thus Cassander's Kingdoms gains,
And now in Macedon as King he reigns;
Though men and mony both he hath at will,
In neither finds content if he sits still:
That Seleucus holds Asia grievs him sore,
Those Countryes large his Father got before.
These to recover, musters all his might,
And with his Son in Law will needs go fight;
A mighty Navy rig'd, an Army stout,
With these he hopes to turn the world about:
Leaving Antigonus his eldest Son,
In his long absence to rule Macedon.
Demetrius with so many troubles met,
As Heaven and Earth against him had been set;
Disaster on disaster him pursue,
His story seems a Fable more then true.
At last he's taken and imprisoned
Within an Isle that was with pleasures fed,
Injoy'd what ere beseem'd his Royalty,
Only restrained of his liberty:
After three years he died, left what he'd won,
In Greece unto Antigonus his Son.
For his Posterity unto this day,
Did ne're regain one foot in Asia;
His Body Seleucus sends to his Son,
Whose obsequies with wondrous pomp was done.
Next di'd the brave and noble Ptolemp,
Renown'd for bounty, valour, clemency,
Rich Egypt left, and what else he had won,
To Philadelphus his more worthy Son.
Of the old Heroes, now but two remain,
Seleucus and Lysimachus these twain,
Must needs go try their fortune and their might,
And so Lysimachus was slain in fight;
'Twas no small joy unto Seleucus breast,
That now he had out-lived all the rest:
Possession of Europe thinks to take,
And so himself the only Monarch make;
Whilst with these hopes in Greece he did remain,
He was by Ptolemy Ceraunus slain.
The second Son of the first Ptolemy,
Who for Rebellion unto him did fly;
Seleucus was a Father and a friend,
Yet by him had this most unworthy end.
Thus with these Kingly Captains have we done,
A little now how the Succession run,
Antigonus, Seleucus and Cassander,
With Ptolemy, reign'd after Alexander;
Cassander's Sons soon after's death were slain,
So three Successors only did remain:
Antigonus his Kingdomes lost and life,
Unto Seleucus, Author of that strife.
His Son Demetrius, all Cassanders gains,
And his posterity, the same retains;
Demetrius Son was call'd Antigonus,
And his again was nam'd Demetrius.
I must let pass those many Battels fought,
Betwixt those Kings, and noble Pyrrhus stout,
And his Son Alexander of Epire,
Whereby immortal honour they acquire;
Demetrius had Philip to his Son,
(Part of whose Kingdomes Titus Quintius won)
Philip had Perseus, who was made a Thrale
T'Emilius the Roman General;
Him with his Sons in Triumph lead did he,
Such riches too as Rome did never see:
This of Antigonus, his Seed's the Fate,
VVhose Empire was subdu'd to th'Roman State.
Longer Seleucus held the royalty,
In Syria by his Posterity;
Antiochus Soter his Son was nam'd,
To whom the old Berosus (so much fam'd,)
His Book of Assurs Monarchs dedicates,
Tells of their names, their wars, their riches, fates;
But this is perished with many more,
VVhich oft we wish was extant as before.
Antiochus Theos was Soter's Son,
VVho a long war with Egypts King begun;
The Affinityes and Wars Daniel sets forth,
And calls them there the Kings of South & North,
This Theos murther'd was by his lewd wife,
Seleucus reign'd, when he had lost his life.
A third Seleucus next sits on the Seat,
And then Antiochus sirnam'd the great,
VVhose large Dominions after was made small,
By Scipio the Roman General;
Fourth Seleucus Antiochus succeeds,
And next Epiphanes whose wicked deeds,
Horrid Massacres, Murthers, cruelties,
Amongst the Jews we read in Machabees.
Antiochus Eupater was the next,
By Rebels and Impostors dayly vext;
So many Princes still were murthered,
The Royal Blood was nigh extinguished;
Then Tygranes the great Armenian King,
To take the Government was called in,
Lucullus, Him, (the Roman General)
Vanquish'd in fight, and took those Kingdomes all;
Of Greece and Syria thus the rule did end,
In Egypt next, a little time wee'l spend.
First Ptolemy being dead, his famous Son
Call'd Philadelphus, did possess the Throne.
At Alexandria a Library did build,
And with seven hundred thousand Volumes fill'd;
The seventy two Interpreters did seek,
They might translate the Bible into Greek.
His Son was Evergetes the last Prince,
That valour shew'd, virtue, or excellence,
Philopater was Evergetes Son,
After Epiphanes sate on the Throne;
Philometor, Evergetes again,
And after him, did false Lathurus reign:
Then Alexander in Lathurus stead,
Next Auletes, who cut off Pompeys head.
To all these names, we Ptolemy must add,
For since the first, they still that Title had.
Fair Cleopatra next, last of that race,
Whom Julius Caesar set in Royal place,
She with her Paramour, Mark Anthony 
Held for a time, the Egyptian Monarchy,
Till great Augustus had with him a fight
At Actium, where his Navy's put to flight;
He seeing his honour lost, his Kingdome end,
Did by his Sword his life soon after send.
His brave Virago Aspes sets to her Arms,
To take her life, and quit her from all harms;
For 'twas not death nor danger she did dread,
But some disgrace in triumph to be led.
Here ends at last the Grecian Monarchy,
Which by the Romans had its destiny;
Thus King & Kingdomes have their times & dates,
Their standings, overturnings, bounds and fates:
Now up, now down now chief, & then broght under,
The heavn's thus rule, to fil the world with wonder
The Assyrian Monarchy long time did stand,
But yet the Persian got the upper hand;
The Grecian them did utterly subdue,
And millions were subjected unto few:
The Grecian longer then the Persian stood,
Then came the Roman like a raging flood;
And with the torrent of his rapid course,
Their Crowns their Titles, riches bears by force.
The first was likened to a head of gold.
Next Arms and breast of silver to behold,
The third, Belly and Thighs of brass in sight,
And last was Iron, which breaketh all with might;
The stone out of the mountain then did rise,
and smote those feet those legs, those arms & thighs
Then gold, silver, brass, Iron and all the store,
Became like Chaff upon the threshing Floor.
The first a Lion, second was a Bear,
The third a Leopard, which four wings did rear;
The last more strong and dreadful then the rest,
Whose Iron teeth devoured every Beast,
And when he had no appetite to eat,
The residue he stamped under feet;
Yet shall this Lion, Bear, this Leopard, Ram,
All trembling stand before the powerful Lamb.
With these three Monarchyes now have I done,
But how the fourth, their Kingdomes from them won,
And how from small beginnings it did grow,
To fill the world with terrour and with woe;
My tyred brain leavs to some better pen,
This task befits not women like to men:
For what is past, I blush, excuse to make,
But humbly stand, some grave reproof to take;
Pardon to crave for errours, is but vain,
The Subject was too high, beyond my strain,
To frame Apology for some offence,
Converts our boldness into impudence:
This my presumption some now to requite,
Ne sutor ultra crepidum may write.
The End of the Grecian Monarchy. 



STROPHE I.
Whilst I rehearse the illustrious House's Praise,
Thrice Victor in Olympia's sportive war,
To friends and strangers open; let my lays
The fame of happy Corinth bear afar:
Which as a gate to Neptune's Isthmus stands,
Proud of her blooming youth and manly bands;
There, fair Eunomia, with her sister train
Blest Peace and Justice, hold their steady reign;
Who wealth and smiling ease on mortals shower,
From Themis' genial care drawing their natal hour.

ANTISTROPHE I.
But bloated insolence and fell disdain
Far from their peaceful seats they drive away.
Now lovely deeds inspire my sounding strain,
And honest boldness swells my rising lay; 
When native worth the generous bosoms feel,
'Tis hard the shining virtues to conceal.
Corinth, on thee the blooming hours bestow
The envied wreaths from manly deeds that flow,
And teach thy daedal sons with careful heart,
First to explore the way of many a useful art.

EPODE I.
Who bade the bullock sacred bleed
To Bacchus in the Dithyrambic Rite?
Who first with reins the generous steed
Directed in his rapid flight?
And bade the sculptur'd bird of Jove 
The temple's massy roofs above,
For ever fix'd on either end,
His ornamental wings extend?
While the sweet Muse her silver sounds inspires,
And Mars with glorious flame the warriors bosom fires.

STROPHE II.
Olympia's honor'd Patron! potent Jove!
Whose sovereign mandates o'er the world extend,
O with propitious ear my strain approve,
And, to fair Corinth's virtuous sons a friend,
On Xenophon let gales propitious breathe,
And take with hand benign the victor wreath
He won: surpassing, when on Pisa's shore,
What mortal valor had perform'd before;
The Stadic Course re-echo'd his renown,
And with knit limbs he gain'd the Pentathletic Crown.

ANTISTROPHE II.
And twice conspicuous on the trophied Course
The Isthmian Parsley graced his Victor brow;
Nor Nemea's Cirque contemn'd the Hero's Force.—
And where the sacred waves of Alpheus flow 
His father Thessalus the Olive wore
By swiftness gain'd, and since on Pythia's shore,
One sun beheld his might, 'mid wondering eyes
Obtain the Stadic, and Diaulic Prize;
And the same month, to grace his lovely brow,
The third triumphal Wreath did Attica bestow.

EPODE II.
Seven times Hellotia crown'd his force,
And since on Isthmus sea-encircled plain,
Victors in Neptune's sacred course,
He and his Sire the Prize obtain.
The swelling joy, the sounding song,
Still follow as they go along;
What wreaths! what honors! too, they bore
From Pythia's, and from Nemea's shore!— 
He who recounts their various crowns, as well
May number all the sands where ocean's billows swell.

STROPHE III.
Some medium though will every praise beseem,—
Which 'tis the first of wisdom still to know.—
While, with no alien voice, the much-lov'd theme
The fame of Corinth from my lips shall flow;
And I her Chiefs, and prudent Sires rehearse,
No sounds fallacious shall disgrace my verse:
There Sisyphus arose, whose wiles could shine
With matchless force and lustre near divine;
Medea there, whom Venus' flames inspire
The Grecian ship to save, and cheat her cruel sire.

ANTISTROPHE III.
When warr'd the Greeks on Phrygia's hostile strand,
On either side her sons embattled stood,
Though to bear Helen from the ill-fated land;
Her warriors with the Atridae cross'd the flood;
Yet some, who those with vengeful spears repell'd
From Corinth's race their honor'd lineage held,
For Lycian Glaucus to the Achaian host
Trembling before his lance, would often boast
His sire's abode, and wealth, and wide domain,
Where fair Pirene's waves enrich the fertile plain.

EPODE III.
Who by the silver fountain's side
Much labor found, and much affliction knew, 
While winged Pegasus he tried
Medusa's offspring to subdue;
Till, sleeping on his native plains,
Minerva gave the golden reins;
‘Awake, aeolian King! awake!
‘This sacred gift with transport take;
‘While at his hallow'd Shrine the votive bullock bleeds.’


STROPHE IV.
The aegis-bearing Maid Minerva spoke,
While midnight slumbers clos'd his heavy eyes;
Straight from the dull embrace of sleep he broke,
And seiz'd with eager hand the glittering prize:
Caeranus' son he sought, the neighbouring Seer,
And pour'd the wond'rous tidings in his ear; 
That, as in awful Pallas' holy Fane,
Sleep o'er his temples spread her leaden reign,
Before him stood confess'd the warlike Maid,
And by his side at once the golden bridle laid.

ANTISTROPHE IV.
The wondering Augur bade him straight obey
Each mystic mandate of the dream divine;
To Neptune first the votive bullock pay,
Then to equestrian Pallas rear a shrine:
The object of his wishes soon fulfil;
For brave Bellerophon, with joyful look,
The sacred present of the Immortals took;
Threw it with ease about his arching head,
And peaceful in his hand the ethereal courser led.


EPODE IV.
Now, shining in refulgent arms,
The winged Pegasus his limbs bestrode;
And, seeking war's severe alarms,
To Amazonia's plains he rode;
And, 'midst the chilling reign of frost,
O'ercame the Female Archer-Host.
His arms Chimaera's flames subdue;
The dauntless Solymi he slew.—
I pass the death his cruel fate decreed,
When Jove's eternal stalls receiv'd the immortal Steed.

STROPHE V.
While thus the shafts of harmony I throw,
Let me not aim too wide with erring hand;
The Muses now command the strain to flow
To Olygaethidae's triumphant band; 
Recount the early praise and young renown,
On Isthmus' and on Nemea's Cirque they won;
In verse concise stupendous deeds display,
And with an oath confirm the wonderous lay;
On either course alike their skill was fam'd,
For sixty Victor Wreaths the Herald's voice proclaim'd.

ANTISTROPHE V.
How oft their brows the Olympic Olive graced,
To Fame already have my numbers given;
What future crowns shall on their heads be placed,
Though we may hope, is only known to Heaven:
Yet if new strifes their genius bids them prove,
We trust the event to Mars, and mighty Jove.
Oft from Parnassus' heights the meed they bore
And Argos' fields, and Thebes' resounding shore; 
And in Lycaean Jove's imperial Fane
Recorded stand their toils on fair Arcadia's plain.

EPODE V.
Pellene's fields, and Sycion's coast;
Megara, and the aeacides' domain;
Eleusis's cirque, and, Freedom's boast,
Fair Marathon's triumphant plain;
Proud aetna, and Eubœa green,
Have their victorious trophies seen.
Through Grecia's realms their large amount
Of wreaths, in vain the Muse would count.—
Assist, immortal Jove! my soaring lays,
And crown with honor'd ease my calm-revolving days. 


Into the skies, one summer's day, 
I sent a little Thought away; 
Up to where, in the blue round, 
The sun sat shining without sound. 

Then my Thought came back to me.—
Little Thought, what did you see 
In the regions whence you come? 
And when I spoke, my Thought was dumb. 

But she breathed of what was there, 
In the pure bright upper air; 
And, because my Thought so shone, 
I knew she had been shone upon. 

Next, by night a Thought I sent 
Up into the firmament; 
When the eager stars were out,
And the still moon shone about. 

And my Thought went past the moon 
In between the stars, but soon 
Held her breath and durst not stir, 
For the fear that covered her;
Then she thought, in this demur: 

'Dare I look beneath the shade, 
Into where the worlds are made; 
Where the suns and stars are wrought? 
Shall I meet another Thought?

'Will that other Thought have wings? 
Shall I meet strange, heavenly things? 
Thought of Thoughts, and Light of Lights, 
Breath of Breaths, and Night of Nights?' 

Then my Thought began to hark
In the illuminated dark, 
Till the silence, over, under, 
Made her heart beat more than thunder. 

And my Thought, came trembling back, 
But with something on her track,
And with something at her side; 
Nor till she has lived and died, 
Lived and died, and lived again, 
Will that awful thing seem plain. 


It actually frightens me
The though of you
Because there are countless things
That it can make me do

The thought of you can make my heart race
It can leave me restless at night
Can make me fidgety to the point where I pace

The thought of you can leave me buzzing with an unknown high
It can form a pit in my stomach
And can leave me love sick and sighing

The thought of you above all other thoughts in my mind shines
It can send shivers down my spine
And make me long for you to be mine

The thought of you can take my breath away
The thought of you from my mind never really strays

But even though the thought of you can send me flying sky high
I'm not gonna lie
I haven't forgotten my heartaching past
Which is why part of me hopes this infatuation doesn't last

But until the thought of you finally fades away
I guess I'll enjoy it
After all
Who knows how long the thought of you will be here to stay


Something is very gently, 
invisibly, silently, 
pulling at me-a thread 
or net of threads 
finer than cobweb and as 
elastic. I haven't tried 
the strength of it. No barbed hook 
pierced and tore me. Was it 
not long ago this thread 
began to draw me? Or 
way back? Was I 
born with its knot about my 
neck, a bridle? Not fear 
but a stirring 
of wonder makes me 
catch my breath when I feel 
the tug of it when I thought 
it had loosened itself and gone. 


Truth is a golden thread, seen here and there 
In small bright specks upon the visible side 
Of our strange being's parti-coloured web. 
How rich the universe! 'Tis a vein of ore 
Emerging now and then on Earth's rude breast, 
But flowing full below. Like islands set 
At distant intervals on Ocean's face, 
We see it on our course; but in the depths 
The mystic colonnade unbroken keeps 
Its faithful way, invisible but sure. 
Oh, if it be so, wherefore do we men 
Pass by so many marks, so little heeding?.
It was three morning-crisp days ago
three mystic autumn days ago
three frost-bitten days ago
three fallen days ago
when nothing was as it seemed
and seeming was better than seeing
and there was more to reality than senses could sense
It was that kind of morning-crisp mystic fallen autumn day
when nature slipped on another overcoat and 
the tree turned from summer dress and garb
and became a Regency era beauty
all beclad and beclothed in gold
sunlight captured in every leaf
bedecked with the fall of life
a seasonal gypsy coming alive
dancing and swaying and plying its charms
clad in gold coin and romantic Romani veils
a natural bedlam more fetching than found
gleaming and sparkling in any moonspun dream 
behold this bright sun-yellow tree
come to brighten the chill of fallen autumn days


The age that was
The age that is now
The age to come




         Away to the west as the sun went down;
     Each thought on the woman who loved him the best,
         And the children stood watching them out of the town;
         For men must work, and women must weep,
         And there's little to earn, and many to keep,
           Though the harbour bar be moaning.

       Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,
         And they trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;
   They looked at the squall, and they looked at the shower,
       And the night-rack came rolling up ragged and brown.
       But men must work, and women must weep,
       Though storms be sudden, and waters deep,
         And the harbour bar be moaning.

     Three corpses lay out on the shining sands
       In the morning gleam as the tide went down,
   And the women are weeping and wringing their hands
       For those who will never come home to the town;
       For men must work, and women must weep,
      And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep;
         And good-bye to the bar and its moaning. 


The grapes upon the Vicar's wall
Were ripe as ripe could be;
And yellow leaves in sun and wind
Were falling from the tree.

On the hedge-elms in the narrow lane
Still swung the spikes of corn:
Young Edward's marriage-morn.

Up through that wood behind the church,
There leads from Edward's door
A mossy track, all over boughed,
For half a mile or more.

And from their house-door by that track
The bride and bridegroom went;
Sweet Mary, though she was not gay,
Seemed cheerful and content.

But when they to the church-yard came,
I've heard poor Mary say,
As soon as she stepped into the sun,
Her heart it died away.

And when the Vicar join'd their hands,
Her limbs did creep and freeze;
But when they prayed, she thought she saw
Her mother on her knees.

And o'er the church-path they returned--
I saw poor Mary's back,
Just as she stepped beneath the boughs
Into the mossy track.

Her feet upon the mossy track
The married maiden set:
That moment--I have heard her say--
She wished she could forget.

The shade o'er-flushed her limbs with heat--
Then came a chill like death:
And when the merry bells rang out,
They seemed to stop her breath.

Beneath the foulest mother's curse
No child could ever thrive:
A mother is a mother still,
The holiest thing alive.

So five months passed: the mother still
Would never heal the strife;
But Edward was a loving man,
And Mary a fond wife.

'My sister may not visit us,
My mother says her nay:
O Edward! you are all to me,
I wish for your sake I could be
More lifesome and more gay.

'I'm dull and sad! indeed, indeed
I know I have no reason!
Perhaps I am not well in health,
And 'tis a gloomy season.'

'Twas a drizzly time--no ice, no snow!
And on the few fine days
She stirred not out, lest she might meet
Her mother in the ways.

But Ellen, spite of miry ways
And weather dark and dreary,
Trudged every day to Edward's house,
And made them all more cheery.

Oh! Ellen was a faithful friend,
More dear than any sister!
As cheerful too as singing lark;
And she ne'er left them till 'twas dark,
And then they always missed her.

And now Ash-Wednesday came-that day
But few to church repair:
For on that day you know we read
The Commination prayer.

Our late old Vicar, a kind man,
Once, Sir, he said to me,
He wished that service was clean out
Of our good Liturgy.

The mother walked into the church--
To Ellen's seat she went:
Though Ellen always kept her church
All church-days during Lent.

And gentle Ellen welcomed her
With courteous looks and mild:
Thought she, 'What if her heart should melt,
And all be reconciled!'

The day was scarcely like a day--
The clouds were black outright:
And many a night, with half a moon,
I've seen the church more light.

The wind was wild; against the glass
The rain did beat and bicker;
The church-tower swinging over head,
You scarce could hear the Vicar!

And then and there the mother knelt,
And audibly she cried-
'Oh! may a clinging curse consume
This woman by my side!

Although you take my life--
O curse this woman, at whose house
Young Edward woo'd his wife.

'By night and day, in bed and bower,
O let her cursed be!!! '
So having prayed, steady and slow,
She rose up from her knee!

And left the church, nor e'er again
The church-door entered she.
I saw poor Ellen kneeling still,
So pale! I guessed not why:
When she stood up, there plainly was
A trouble in her eye.

And when the prayers were done, we all
Came round and asked her why:
Giddy she seemed, and sure, there was
A trouble in her eye.

But ere she from the church-door stepped
She smiled and told us why:
'It was a wicked woman's curse,'
Quoth she, 'and what care I?'

She smiled, and smiled, and passed it off
Ere from the door she stept--
But all agree it would have been
Much better had she wept.

And if her heart was not at ease,
This was her constant cry--
'It was a wicked woman's curse--

There was a hurry in her looks,
Her struggles she redoubled:
'It was a wicked woman's curse,
And why should I be troubled?'

These tears will come--I dandled her
When 'twas the merest fairy--
Good creature! and she hid it all:
She told it not to Mary.

But Mary heard the tale: her arms
Round Ellen's neck she threw;
'O Ellen, Ellen, she cursed me,
And now she hath cursed you!'

I saw young Edward by himself
Stalk fast adown the lee,
He snatched a stick from every fence,
A twig from every tree.

He snapped them still with hand or knee,
And then away they flew!
As if with his uneasy limbs
He knew not what to do!

You see, good Sir! that single hill?
His farm lies underneath:
He heard it there, he heard it all,
And only gnashed his teeth.

Now Ellen was a darling love
In all his joys and cares:
And Ellen's name and Mary's name
Fast-linked they both together came,
Whene'er he said his prayers.

And in the moment of his prayers
He loved them both alike:
Yea, both sweet names with one sweet joy
Upon his heart did strike!

He reach'd his home, and by his looks
They saw his inward strife:
And they clung round him with their arms,
Both Ellen and his wife.

And Mary could not check her tears,
So on his breast she bowed;
Then frenzy melted into grief,
And Edward wept aloud.

Dear Ellen did not weep at all,
But closelier did she cling,
And turned her face and looked as if
She saw some frightful thing.

PART II.

To see a man tread over graves
I hold it no good mark;
'Tis wicked in the sun and moon,
And bad luck in the dark!

O Sir! the child of my old age
Lies there as cold as clay.

Except that grave, you scarce see one
That was not dug by me;
I'd rather dance upon 'em all
Than tread upon these three!

'Aye, Sexton!


'tis a touching tale.'
You, Sir! are but a lad;
This month I'm in my seventieth year,
And still it makes me sad.

And Mary's sister told it me,
For three good hours and more;
Though I had heard it, in the main,
From Edward's self, before.

Well! it passed off! the gentle Ellen
Did well nigh dote on Mary;
And she went oftener than before,
And Mary loved her more and more:
She managed all the dairy.

To market she on market-days,
To church on Sundays came;
All seemed the same: all seemed so, Sir!
But all was not the same!

Had Ellen lost her mirth? Oh! no!
But she was seldom cheerful;
And Edward look'd as if he thought
That Ellen's mirth was fearful.

When by herself, she to herself
Must sing some merry rhyme;
She could not now be glad for hours,
Yet silent all the time.

And when she soothed her friend, through all
Her soothing words 'twas plain
She had a sore grief of her own,
A haunting in her brain.

And oft she said, I'm not grown thin!
And then her wrist she spanned;
And once when Mary was down-cast,
She took her by the hand,
And gazed upon her, and at first
She gently pressed her hand;

Then harder, till her grasp at length
Did gripe like a convulsion!
'Alas!' said she, 'we ne'er can be
Made happy by compulsion!'

And once her both arms suddenly
Round Mary's neck she flung,
And her heart panted, and she felt
The words upon her tongue.

She felt them coming, but no power
Had she the words to smother;
And with a kind of shriek she cried,

So gentle Ellen now no more
Could make this sad house cheery;
And Mary's melancholy ways
Drove Edward wild and weary.

Lingering he raised his latch at eve,
Though tired in heart and limb:
He loved no other place, and yet
Home was no home to him.

One evening he took up a book,
And nothing in it read;
Then flung it down, and groaning cried,
'O! Heaven! that I were dead.'

Mary looked up into his face,
And nothing to him said;
She tried to smile, and on his arm
Mournfully leaned her head.

And he burst into tears, and fell
Upon his knees in prayer:
It is too great to bear!'

'Twas such a foggy time as makes
Old sextons, Sir! like me,
Rest on their spades to cough; the spring
Was late uncommonly.

And then the hot days, all at once,
They came, we knew not how:
You looked about for shade, when scarce
A leaf was on a bough.

It happened then ('twas in the bower,
A furlong up the wood:
Perhaps you know the place, and yet
I scarce know how you should,)

No path leads thither, 'tis not nigh
To any pasture-plot;
But clustered near the chattering brook,
Lone hollies marked the spot.

Those hollies of themselves a shape
As of an arbour took,
A close, round arbour; and it stands
Not three strides from a brook.

Within this arbour, which was still
With scarlet berries hung,
Were these three friends, one Sunday morn,
Just as the first bell rung.

'Tis sweet to hear a brook, 'tis sweet
To hear the Sabbath-bell,
'Tis sweet to hear them both at once,
Deep in a woody dell.

His limbs along the moss, his head
Upon a mossy heap,
With shut-up senses, Edward lay:
That brook e'en on a working day
Might chatter one to sleep.

And he had passed a restless night,
And was not well in health;
The women sat down by his side,
And talked as 'twere by stealth.

'The Sun peeps through the close thick leaves,
See, dearest Ellen! see!
'Tis in the leaves, a little sun,
No bigger than your ee;

'A tiny sun, and it has got
A perfect glory too;
Ten thousand threads and hairs of light,
Make up a glory gay and bright
Round that small orb, so blue.'

And then they argued of those rays,
What colour they might be;
Says this, 'They're mostly green'; says that,
'They're amber-like to me.'

So they sat chatting, while bad thoughts
Were troubling Edward's rest;
But soon they heard his hard quick pants,
And the thumping in his breast.

'A mother too!' these self-same words
Did Edward mutter plain;
His face was drawn back on itself,
With horror and huge pain.

Both groan'd at once, for both knew well
What thoughts were in his mind;
When he waked up, and stared like one
That hath been just struck blind.

He sat upright; and ere the dream
Had had time to depart,
'I have torn out her heart.'

Then Ellen shrieked, and forthwith burst
Into ungentle laughter;
And Mary shivered, where she sat,
And never she smiled after.




Mary peered through the window grate.

'You glorious Kings, I bid you stay, 
Though the house is abounding with beasts and bay.'

They bowed their heads beneath the door, 
And bend their knees down to the floor.

'Three Kings we are, we came from afar, 
But you, sweet child, much greater you are.

'No crown you wear, no gown of gold, 
Though you are the King of whom we are told.

Your heart glows bright, will be the crown
For man and woman in every town.'

The Kings departed. In awe and surprise
Mary sat down with tears in her eyes.

(after: Otto Julius Bierbaum (-  : Die heiligen drei Könige)I've been entered in a three-legged race, 
And somehow, I'm tied up to Jane, 
Oh goodness me, Oh, No! No! No! , 
She's fallen down again.

The handkerchief's tied up far too tight, 
Now it's really cutting into my ankle, .
I've tried to release it, with all of my might, 
But now it's beginning to rankle.

Oops! Oh Lor! She's now keeling over, 
She'll never be steady at this game, 
At least she has fallen onto the clover, 
Ouch!  That was a real shocking pain! 

We are wobbling off across the lawn, 
But certainly not running as 'one', 
I've a feeling that my ligament's been torn 
This cannot possibly be rated as fun.

She clearly doesn't have the knack at all, 
We're not even of the same height, 
But if I had partnered the nice boy Paul, 
Both of us would have stayed upright! 

No way are we going to win this race, 
Oh. Goodness, now I've lost my shoe, 
And Jane's got grass stains all over her face, 
I wish that these 'legs' were just my two. 

The animal I really dig,
Above all others is the pig.
Pigs are noble. Pigs are clever,
Pigs are courteous. However,
Now and then, to break this rule,
One meets a pig who is a fool.
What, for example, would you say,
If strolling through the woods one day,
Right there in front of you you saw
A pig who'd built his house of STRAW?
The Wolf who saw it licked his lips,
And said, 'That pig has had his chips.' 
'Little pig, little pig, let me come in!'
'No, no, by the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin!'
'Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!'

The little pig began to pray,
But Wolfie blew his house away.
He shouted, 'Bacon, pork and ham!
Oh, what a lucky Wolf I am!'
And though he ate the pig quite fast,
He carefully kept the tail till last.
Wolf wandered on, a trifle bloated.
Surprise, surprise, for soon he noted
Another little house for pigs,
And this one had been built of TWIGS!

'Little pig, little pig, let me come in!'
'No, no, by the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin!'
'Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!'

The Wolf said, 'Okay, here we go!'
He then began to blow and blow.
The little pig began to squeal.
He cried, 'Oh Wolf, you've had one meal!
Why can't we talk and make a deal?
The Wolf replied, 'Not on your nelly!'
And soon the pig was in his belly.

'Two juicy little pigs!' Wolf cried,
'But still I'm not quite satisfied!
I know how full my tummy's bulging,
But oh, how I adore indulging.'
So creeping quietly as a mouse,
The Wolf approached another house,
A house which also had inside
A little piggy trying to hide.
'You'll not get me!' the Piggy cried.
'I'll blow you down!' the Wolf replied.
'You'll need,' Pig said, 'a lot of puff,
And I don't think you've got enough.'
Wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew.
The house stayed up as good as new. 
'If I can't blow it down,' Wolf said,
I'll have to blow it up instead.
I'll come back in the dead of night
And blow it up with dynamite!'
Pig cried, 'You brute! I might have known!'
Then, picking up the telephone,
He dialed as quickly as he could
The number of red Riding Hood.

'Hello,' she said. 'Who's speaking? Who?
Oh, hello, Piggy, how d'you do?'
Pig cried, 'I need your help, Miss Hood!
Oh help me, please! D'you think you could?'
'I'll try of course,' Miss Hood replied.
'What's on your mind. ?' 'A Wolf!' Pig cried.
'I know you've dealt with wolves before,
And now I've got one at my door!'

'My darling Pig,' she said, 'my sweet,
That's something really up my street.
I've just begun to wash my hair.
But when it's dry, I'll be right there.'

A short while later, through the wood,
Came striding brave Miss Riding Hood.
The Wolf stood there, his eyes ablaze,
And yellowish, like mayonnaise.
His teeth were sharp, his gums were raw,
And spit was dripping from his jaw.
Once more the maiden's eyelid flickers.
She draws the pistol from her knickers.
Once more she hits the vital spot,
And kills him with a single shot.
Pig, peeping through the window, stood
And yelled, 'Well done, Miss Riding Hood!'

Ah, Piglet, you must never trust
Young ladies from the upper crust.
For now, Miss Riding Hood, one notes,
Not only has two wolfskin coats,
But when she goes from place to place,
She has a PIGSKIN TRAVELING CASE. 

There were three ravens sat on a tree, 
They were as black as they might be.

The one of them said to his mate, 
'Where shall we our breakefast take?'

'Downe in yonder greene field, 
There lies a knight slain under his shield.

'His hounds they lie downe at his feete, 
So well they can their master keepe.

There's no fowle dare come him nie.'

Downe there comes a fallow doe, 
As great with yong as she might goe.

She lift up his bloudy hed, 
And kist his wounds that were so red.

She got him up upon her backe, 
And carried him to earthen lake.

She buried him before the prime, 
She was dead herselfe ere even-song time.


Though friendships differ endless  in degree , 
   The  sorts , methinks, may be reduced to three.
    Ac quaintance many, and  Con quaintance few;
   But for  In quaintance I know only two--
   The friend I've mourned with, and the maid I woo

Far are those tranquil hills,
Dyed with fair evening's rose;
On urgent, secret errand bent,
A traveller goes.

Approach him strangers three,
Barefooted, cowled; their eyes
Scan the lone, hastening solitary
With dumb surmise.

One instant in close speech
With them he doth confer:
That anxious traveller


I was that man — in a dream:
And each world's night in vain
I patient wait on sleep to unveil
Those vivid hills again.

Would that they three could know
How yet burns on in me
Love — from one lost in Paradise — 
For their grave courtesy. 

Son, what will you do 
The teacher stares at the years old student 
With a deep sigh
Adam’s tears roll back
His eyes as sharp as a razor blade 
Glancing at Mr. Cool
Not a word spoken
He picks up his pen and starts to write
He folds up the written piece 
And hand it over to the teacher
One condition applies
The teacher should read it when he got home
Adam is a gifted kid 
Born with silver spoon in his mouth
The only son in a family of four
Before he goes to bed
With a deep breathe 
Mr. Cool reads the note
My first wish
I want to be an orphan
I want to feel the suffering
I want to feel the painstaking

So that when I grow up
I’d know what hardship is
My second wish
I want to be blind
I want to feel the darkness
I want to feel the gloom
I want to feel the beauty of the world

Without looking
I want to feel the agony of the world
Without seeing
My third wish
I want to be the richest man on earth
I want to share my wealth with the poor
I want to help the homeless

The jobless
The education less
The family less
The loveless

If there is any fourth wish
I want the three wishes
Mr. Cool’s tears roll back
He goes to sleep
With a smile


Musing I met, in no strange land,
What meet thou must to understand:
An Angel. There was none but he,
Yet 'twas a glorious company.
In altering wedlock flamed benign.
The Youth i' the midst did shadowy seem,
Till merged in either blest extreme,
But could, by choosing, each way turn,
And, whether he chose Hers or His,
He glow'd at once with either's bliss.
A solar force, an infant's smile;
Breasted the Wonder was and loin'd
With Man and Woman's beauties join'd;
And thence, O, moonlike and most sweet,
Which, when they felt the one the other,
Felt each like Cupid and his Mother. 
Unwearying, since I caught that sight,
Him have I praised by whose word's might
The Heavens and the Earth did breathe
And the gay Waters underneath. 


The clock ticks, and rings a chime, 
A signal of the passing time.
The night outside is brisk and cold, 
But here we are, and you I hold.

Quiet words of passion and love
Wing from lips like a graceful dove.
Hands fly over bare body and skin, 
Pausing gently above your chin.

As we speak though, the night is fading, 
Nature takes hold, she does no waiting.
We kiss again, wishing we could stay
Instead of leaving to face the day. 



The Tide
The Spill Canvas


Verse #And there’s three
Count um three
Children playing on the beach.
They were eager to learn, 
To be taught, 
And to teach.
There’s Veronica.
She’s biting her lips as she watches the waves turn white at the tip.
And there’s Veta.
She’s radiating with joy, 
And like a leash she still can’t stand the sight of a boy.
And lastly there’s Dave.
His hair dances in the wind 
And he’s wondering 
What love is.
And why
It has to 
End.

And he didn’t understand
How everyone goes on breathing when true love ends.
His mother whispers quietly.
Heavens not a place that you go when you die
It’s that moment in life when you actually feel alive.
So live for the moment.
And take this advice
 Live by every word.
Love is just a hoax 
So forget everything that you have heard.
And live for the moment now.


Verse #And there’s three
Count um three
Children growing on the beach.
They were eager to learn
To be taught and to teach
There’s Veronica
She’s licking her lips 
As she waits for her real first passionate kiss.
And there’s Veta
She can’t admit her jealousy 
Of her sister veronica 
And how she’s so pretty.
And lastly there Dave
Still sitting on the dock.
He ponders his life 
And he
Skips his rocks.
And he wonders 
When his father will return. 
But he’s not coming back. 
 
And he didn’t understand
How everyone goes on breathing when true love ends.
His mother whispers quietly.
Heavens not a place that you go when you die
It’s that moment in life when you actually feel alive.
So live for the moment.
And take this advice 
Live by every word.
Love is just a hoax 
So forget everything that you have heard.
And live for the moment now.


Forget everything

Verse #And there’s three
Count um three
Children missing from the beach.
They were eager to learn
To be taught and to teach.
But the sad thing 
Is that they never lived past the age of fifteen
Due to neglect
From their mother
Who was bedridden from her ex lover
And their father. 
And she didn’t even notice 
Or pay much attention
As the tide came in
And swept her three into the ocean.
Now all her advice 
It seems
Useless.


 No heavens not a place that you go when you die
It’s that moment in life when you touch her and you feel alive.
So live for the moment.
And take this advice 
Live by every word.
Loves completely real.
So forget everything that you have heard.
And live for the moment now. 

It may look the same -
On the surface
Life is continuing as before – 
without the goal, without the purpose

Are you tired of the old paradigm? 
Now is the time for a wild ride! 
Don’t you feel the change in currents? 
Don’t you see the rising of the tide? 

The tide is coming
Everywhere and all at once
The facades will dropp on a dime
They stand no chance

The dogmas of the establishment
Like the broken crust
Will go the way of dinosaurs –
To die they surely must

Even the time itself
Is not immune to change
The Mayan calendar is over
We need a new Stonehenge

The time is rushing faster and faster
Did you hear that the h race is over? 
Humanity starts on its h race

your cheeks magnify a submissive madness 
modulating through joy and laughter 
I translate the music of those moments



Tiger! Tiger! burning bright
In the forests of the night, 
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 

In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes? 
On what wings dare he aspire? 
What the hand dare seize the fire? 

And what shoulder and what art, 
Could twist the sinews of thy heart? 
And when thy heart began to beat, 
What dread hand and what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain? 
In what furnace was thy brain? 
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp? 

When the stars threw down their spears, 
And watered heaven with their tears, 
Did he smile his work to see? 
Did he who made the Lamb make thee? 

Tiger! Tiger! burning bright
In the forests of the night, 
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry

Friend? hope for the Guest while you are alive. 
Jump into experience while you are alive!
Think.  and think.  while you are alive.
What you call 'salvation' belongs to the time 
before death.

If you don't break your ropes while you're alive,
do you think ghosts will do it after?

The idea that the soul will join with the ecstatic
just because the body is rotten -- 
that is all fantasy.
What is found now is found then.
If you find nothing now,
you will simply end up with an apartment in the
City of Death.
If you make love with the divine now, in the next 
life you will have the face of satisfied desire.

So plunge into the truth, find out who the Teacher is,
Believe in the Great Sound!

Kabir says this: When the Guest is being searched for,
it is the intensity of the longing for the Guest
that does all the work.

Look at me, and you will see a slave of that intensity. 

The time I like best is m
when the snow is inches deep
which I'm yet to discover
'cause I'm under the covers
fast, fast asleep. 

The time indicator of clock 
Is going round and round
And I am getting older
And the pages of Calendar 
Are its daily reminder.

Through the pain of loneliness 
Insult and shame
I am passing my best time of youth
And I don't even know your name.

Time is running out 
The burden of sorrow is increasing day by day
And all interest to be alive is fading away.

In my lifetime shall I be so lucky
To hold you close to me? 
Babe this difficult question
Is recurring in my brain 
Over and over again. 

The time is here
To take a bow and call it a day
To wipe the tears of joy and move on to greener pastures
To stay within my dreams 
To believe in faith and go on to my destiny
The journey has been long
Even longer yet it is
But I continue
You, on my side
Our families united 
A thousand stars I take with me on this journey
To brighten the darkest of days and fill me with hope
A thousand waters I take with me on this journey
To quench my thirst, so I hunger not for the desires of the flesh
Nor the selfish desires that will causes me to stray
And loose focus
For your thoughts are always with me, to whisper to me
If ever I am lonely
Or to perk me up
If ever I am sad
I go on: 
To find hope
To find a future
I believe in you
I believe in our future

I wish my flowing tears; stood witness, 
to a crashing loneliness, in this cess.
O'had we not made a forsaken start, 
and none had bet for a broken heart.
Hopes, heart, dashed to bits on distant isles, 
to impassable barriers of a million miles.
The armada's hopeless tryst with far-off rifts, 
stands alone, cluthing, fistful sands, as it drifts.
Lost to anguish, hurting wistful desires, 
ambers doused afore the raging fires.
I wish those memories; would just wash, 
spare me the pain and enduring splosh. 
Heaven intercede, to completely erase, 
the mindless waves, sadness and craze.




More than halfway up the pass
Was a spring with a broken drinking glass,
And whether the farmer drank or not
His mare was sure to observe the spot
By cramping the wheel on a water-bar,
turning her forehead with a star,
And straining her ribs for a monster sigh;
To which the farmer would make reply,
'A sigh for every so many breath,
And for every so many sigh a death.
That's what I always tell my wife
Is the multiplication table of life.'
The saying may be ever so true;
But it's just the kind of a thing that you
Nor I, nor nobody else may say,
Unless our purpose is doing harm,
And then I know of no better way
To close a road, abandon a farm,
Reduce the births of the human race,
And bring back nature in people's place. 


love is enfolded in love
for lovers

but does it last, that
must be answered in time

time to love, and time to
quarrel

finally, the question is
answered


What hast thou ever done for me? 
Defeated every good endeavor; 
I never can through life agree 
To place my confidence in thee, 
Not ever, no, never! 

Often have I thy steam admired, 
Thou nothing hast avail'd me ever; 
Vain have I thought myself inspired, 
Say, have I else but pain acquired? 
Not ever, no, never! 

No earthly good, no stream of health, 
Flows from thy fount, thou cheerful giver; 
From thee, affluence sinks to stealth, 
From thee I pluck no bloom of health, 
Whatever, no, never! 

Thou canst impart a nobel mind, 
Power from my tongue flows like a river; 
The gas flows dead, I'm left behind, 
To all that's evil down confined, 
To flourish more never! 

With thee I must through life complain, 
Thy powers at large will union sever; 
Disgorge no more thy killing bane, 
The bird hope flies from thee in pain, 
To return more never

O whisper, O my soul! The afternoon 
Is waning into evening, whisper soft! 
Peace, O my rebel heart! for soon the moon 
From out its misty veil will swing aloft! 
Be patient, weary body, soon the night 
Will wrap thee gently in her sable sheet, 
And with a leaden sigh thou wilt invite 
To rest thy tired hands and aching feet. 
The wretched day was theirs, the night is mine; 
Come tender sleep, and fold me to thy breast. 
But what steals out the gray clouds like red wine? 
O dawn! O dreaded dawn! O let me rest 
Weary my veins, my brain, my life! Have pity! 
No! Once again the harsh, the ugly city. 


Send me some token, that my hope may live,
 Or that my easeless thoughts may sleep and rest;
Send me some honey to make sweet my hive,
 That in my passions I may hope the best.
I beg no riband wrought with thine own hands,
 To knit our loves in the fantastic strain
Of new-touched youth; nor ring to show the stands
 Of our affection, that as that's round and plain,
So should our loves meet in simplicity;
 No, nor the corals which thy wrist enfold,
Laced up together in congruity,
 To show our thoughts should rest in the same hold;
No, nor thy picture, though most gracious,
 And most desired, because best like the best;
Nor witty lines, which are most copious,
 Within the writings which thou hast addressed.


Send me nor this, nor that, to increase my store,
But swear thou think'st 'I love thee,' and no more. 

The buried temple shows by the sewer-mouth’s
Sepulchral slobber of mud and rubies,
Some abominable statue of Anubis,
The muzzle lit like a ferocious snout

Or as when a dubious wick twists in the new gas,
Having, we know, to wipe out insults suffered
Haggardly kindling an immortal pubis, 
Whose flight strays according to the lamp

What votive leaves, dried in cities without evening
Could bless, as she can, vainly sitting
Against the marble of Baudelaire

Shudderingly absent from the veil that clothes her
She, his shade, a protective poisonous air
Always to be breathed, although we die of her. 

Such as at last eternity transforms into Himself,
The Poet rouses with two-edged naked sword,
His century terrified at having ignored 
Death triumphant in so strange a voice!

They, like a spasm of the Hydra, hearing the angel
Once grant a purer sense to the words of the tribe,
Loudly proclaimed it a magic potion, imbibed
From some tidal brew black, and dishonourable.

From soil, and hostile cloud, O grief,
If our imagination can’t carve a bas-relief
With which to deck Poe’s dazzling sepulchre,

Calm block fallen here from some dark disaster,
Let your granite at least mark a boundary forever
To dark flights of Blasphemy scattered in the future. 


The tombstone told when she died.
Her two surnames stopped me still.
A virgin married at rest.
She married in this pouring place,
That I struck one day by luck,
Before I heard in my mother's side
Or saw in the looking-glass shell
The rain through her cold heart speak
And the sun killed in her face.
More the thick stone cannot tell.
Before she lay on a stranger's bed
With a hand plunged through her hair,
Or that rainy tongue beat back
Through the devilish years and innocent deaths
To the room of a secret child,
Among men later I heard it said
She cried her white-dressed limbs were bare
And her red lips were kissed black,
She wept in her pain and made mouths,
Talked and tore though her eyes smiled.
I who saw in a hurried film
Death and this mad heroine
Meet once on a mortal wall
Heard her speak through the chipped beak
Of the stone bird guarding her:
I died before bedtime came
But my womb was bellowing
And I felt with my bare fall
A blazing red harsh head tear up
And the dear floods of his hair. 


The tongue 
Can utter sweet words
Of love and affection
Of praise and gratitude
To fill the mind.

The same tongue
Can become a sharp knife
Of  cutting with words crude
Without drawing blood 
To kill the mind. 

We too, we too, descending once again
The hills of our own land, we too have heard
Far off --- Ah, que ce cor a longue haleine ---
The horn of Roland in the passages of Spain,
The first, the second blast, the failing third,
And with the third turned back and climbed once more
The steep road southward, and heard faint the sound
Of swords, of horses, the disastrous war,
And crossed the dark defile at last, and found
At Roncevaux upon the darkening plain
The dead against the dead and on the silent ground
The silent slain---the topic is love
and how it turns to hate
the topic is how I lose my self each day
the topic of today’s lesson will be how love falls apart
the lesson will be great
from the very start
lets all learn how to crush our lovers dreams
lets pretend we care
and act like we understand
lets learn how to hold someone hand
lets do this thing
the right way
lets forget how to forgive
and lose sight of what’s important
Lets all learn to love
with as much hate as possible
today’s topic.
Love
but, it’s really just a different type of hate. 


I could see the electric poles fly apart
Lines snap asunder
Giant trees  uprooted like weed 
Cars uplifted like matchbox 
And smashed onto the ground with disdain, 
While the landscape was engulfed
In an eerie dusty darkness
And the sound of the tornado
Pounding menacingly 
Raged in my ears
Threatening to reduce into smithereens
Anything and everything
That came its way.


I could see, that my mind was in a whirl
My aching heart in a swirl - 
No! It was not a horrible tornado 
But a passing anger, ranting and raving. 

Said the tortoise to the hare
"Why are you so fast out there"
The hare then replied, 
That "It’s just my stride
And the thought I can run anywhere"Within my house of patterned horn 
I sleep in such a bed 
As men may keep before they're born 
And after when they're dead.


Sticks and stones may break their bones, 
And words may make them bleed; 
There is not one of them who owns 
An armour to his need.

Tougher than hide or lozenged bark, 
Snow-storm and thunder proof, 
And quick with sun, and thick with dark, 
Is this my darling roof.

Men's troubled dreams of death and birth 
Puls mother-o'-pearl to black; 
I bear the rainbow bubble Earth 
Square on my scornful back. 


Their strength had fed on this when Death's white arms 
Curling across the jungle's ferny floor, 
Becking each fevered brain. On bleak divides, 
Where Sleep grew niggardly for nipping cold 
That twinged blue lips into a mouthed curse, 
Not back to Seville and its sunny plains 
Winged their brief-biding dreams, but once again, 
They guarded Montezuma's treasure-hoard. 
Gold, like some finny harvest of the sea, 
Poured out knee deep around the rifted floors, 
Shiny and sparkling, -- arms and crowns and rings: 
Gold, sweet to toy with as beloved hair, -- 
To plunge the lustful, crawling fingers down, 
Arms elbow deep, and draw them out again, 
And watch the glinting metal trickle off, 
Even as at night some fisherman, home bound 
With speckled cargo in his hollow keel 
Caught off Campeche or the Isle of Pines, 
Dips in his paddle, lifts it forth again, 
And laughs to see the luminous white drops 
Fall back in flakes of fire. . . . Gold was the dream 
That cheered that desperate enterprise. And now? . . . 
Victory waited on the arms of Spain, 
Fallen was the lovely city by the lake, 
The sunny Venice of the western world; 
There many corpses, rotting in the wind, 
Poked up stiff limbs, but in the leprous rags 
No jewel caught the sun, no tawny chain 
Gleamed, as the prying halberds raked them o'er. 
Pillage that ran red-handed through the streets 
Came railing home at evening empty-palmed; 
And they, on that sad night a twelvemonth gone, 
Who, ounce by ounce, dear as their own life's blood 
Retreating, cast the cumbrous load away: 
They, when brown foemen lopped the bridges down, 
Who tipped thonged chests into the stream below 
And over wealth that might have ransomed kings 
Passed on to safety; -- cheated, guerdonless -- 
Found (through their fingers the bright booty slipped) 
A city naked, of that golden dream 
Shorn in one moment like a sunset sky. 


Deep in a chamber that no cheerful ray 
Purged of damp air, where in unbroken night 
Black scorpions nested in the sooty beams, 
Helpless and manacled they led him down -- 
Cuauhtemotzin -- and other lords beside -- 
All chieftains of the people, heroes all -- 
And stripped their feathered robes and bound them there 
On short stone settles sloping to the head, 
But where the feet projected, underneath 
Heaped the red coals. Their swarthy fronts illumed, 
The bearded Spaniards, helmed and haubergeoned, 
Paced up and down beneath the lurid vault. 
Some kneeling fanned the glowing braziers; some 
Stood at the sufferers' heads and all the while 
Hissed in their ears: "The gold . . . the gold . . . the gold. 
Where have ye hidden it -- the chested gold? 
Speak -- and the torments cease!" 


They answered not. 
Past those proud lips whose key their sovereign claimed 
No accent fell to chide or to betray, 
Only it chanced that bound beside the king 
Lay one whom Nature, more than other men 
Framing for delicate and perfumed ease, 
Not yet, along the happy ways of Youth, 
Had weaned from gentle usages so far 
To teach that fortitude that warriors feel 
And glory in the proof. He answered not, 
But writhing with intolerable pain, 
Convulsed in every limb, and all his face 
Wrought to distortion with the agony, 
Turned on his lord a look of wild appeal, 
The secret half atremble on his lips, 
Livid and quivering, that waited yet 
For leave -- for leave to utter it -- one sign -- 
One word -- one little word -- to ease his pain. 


As one reclining in the banquet hall, 
Propped on an elbow, garlanded with flowers, 
Saw lust and greed and boisterous revelry 
Surge round him on the tides of wine, but he, 
Staunch in the ethic of an antique school -- 
Stoic or Cynic or of Pyrrho's mind -- 
With steady eyes surveyed the unbridled scene, 
Himself impassive, silent, self-contained: 
So sat the Indian prince, with brow unblanched, 
Amid the tortured and the torturers. 
He who had seen his hopes made desolate, 
His realm despoiled, his early crown deprived him, 
And watched while Pestilence and Famine piled 
His stricken people in their reeking doors, 
Whence glassy eyes looked out and lean brown arms 
Stretched up to greet him in one last farewell 
As back and forth he paced along the streets 
With words of hopeless comfort -- what was this 
That one should weaken now? He weakened not. 
Whate'er was in his heart, he neither dealt 
In pity nor in scorn, but, turning round, 
Met that racked visage with his own unmoved, 
Bent on the sufferer his mild calm eyes, 
And while the pangs smote sharper, in a voice, 
As who would speak not all in gentleness 
Nor all disdain, said: "Yes! And am -I- then 
Upon a bed of roses?" 


Stung with shame -- 
Shame bitterer than his anguish -- to betray 
Such cowardice before the man he loved, 
And stilled his struggling limbs and moaning cries, 
And shook away his tears, and strove to smile, 
And turned his face against the wall -- and died. 


Tell me who can
Catch a toucan?
Lou can.

Just how few can
Ride the toucan?
Two can.

What kind of goo can
Stick you to the toucan?
Glue can.

Who can write some
More about the toucan?
You can


i looked up into the deep blue sky
little white clouds were floating by
i looked upon this young girls face
she held it down in disgrace.

i looked upon her cheeks so fair
she looked up to me to see if i care
i looked at her with content
and she knew right there it was heaven sent.

she smiled at me, and our eyes then touched
we knew then, it was much to much.
our hearts entwined and her lips met mine
we felt right there it was a love divine. 


For months my hand was sealed off 
in a tin box. Nothing was there but the subway railings. 
Perhaps it is bruised, I thought, 
and that is why they have locked it up. 
You could tell time by this, I thought, 
like a clock, by its five knuckles 
and the thin underground veins. 
It lay there like an unconscious woman 
fed by tubes she knew not of. 

The hand had collapse, 
a small wood pigeon 
that had gone into seclusion. 
I turned it over and the palm was old, 
its lines traced like fine needlepoint 
and stitched up into fingers. 
It was fat and soft and blind in places. 
Nothing but vulnerable. 

And all this is metaphor. 
An ordinary hand - just lonely 
for something to touch 
that touches back. 
The dog won't do it. 
Her tail wags in the swamp for a frog. 
I'm no better than a case of dog food. 
She owns her own hunger. 
My sisters won't do it. 
They live in school except for buttons 
and tears running down like lemonade. 
My father won't do it. 
He comes in the house and even at night 
he lives in a machine made by my mother 
and well oiled by his job, his job. 

The trouble is 
that I'd let my gestures freeze. 
The trouble was not 
in the kitchen or the tulips 
but only in my head, my head. 

Then all this became history. 
Your hand found mine. 
Life rushed to my fingers like a blood clot. 
Oh, my carpenter, 
the fingers are rebuilt. 
They dance with yours. 
They dance in the attic and in Vienna. 
My hand is alive all over America. 
Not even death will stop it, 
death shedding her blood. 
Nothing will stop it, for this is the kingdom 
and the kingdom come. 


Time, who with soft pale ashes veils the brand
Of many a hope that flared against the sky
To plant its heaven-storming banners high,
Has touched you with no desecrating hand;
Your beauty wins a ripeness sweet and bland
As opulent summer, and your glancing eye
Glows with a deeper lustre, and your sigh
Of love is still my clamouring heart's command.

Yet what if all your fairness were defaced,
Wilted by passionate whirlwinds, battle-scarred,
Your skin of delicate satin hard and dry?
Still you would be the laughing girl who graced
A gloomy manhood, by forebodings marred,
In the deep wood where still we love to lie. 




Joust First.


    I.

Bright shone the lists, blue bent the skies,
 And the knights still hurried amain
To the tournament under the ladies' eyes,
 Where the jousters were Heart and Brain.

    II.

Flourished the trumpets:  entered Heart,
 A youth in crimson and gold.
Flourished again:  Brain stood apart,
 Steel-armored, dark and cold.

    III.

Heart's palfrey caracoled gayly round,
 Heart tra-li-ra'd merrily;
But Brain sat still, with never a sound,
 So cynical-calm was he.

    IV.

Heart's helmet-crest bore favors three
 From his lady's white hand caught;
While Brain wore a plumeless casque; not he
 Or favor gave or sought.

    V.

The herald blew; Heart shot a glance
 To find his lady's eye,
But Brain gazed straight ahead his lance
 To aim more faithfully.

    VI.

They charged, they struck; both fell, both bled.
 Brain rose again, ungloved,
Heart, dying, smiled and faintly said,
 "My love to my beloved!"





  Joust Second.


    I.

A-many sweet eyes wept and wept,
 A-many bosoms heaved again;
A-many dainty dead hopes slept
 With yonder Heart-knight prone o' the plain.

    II.

Yet stars will burn through any mists,
 And the ladies' eyes, through rains of fate,
Still beamed upon the bloody lists
 And lit the joust of Love and Hate.

    III.

O strange! or ere a trumpet blew,
 Or ere a challenge-word was given,
A knight leapt down i' the lists; none knew
 Whether he sprang from earth or heaven.

    IV.

His cheek was soft as a lily-bud,
 His grey eyes calmed his youth's alarm;
Nor helm nor hauberk nor even a hood
 Had he to shield his life from harm.

    V.

No falchion from his baldric swung,
 He wore a white rose in its place.
No dagger at his girdle hung,
 But only an olive-branch, for grace.

    VI.

And "Come, thou poor mistaken knight,"
 Cried Love, unarmed, yet dauntless there,
 Sans sword, sans shield; yet, Hate, beware!"

    VII.

Spurred furious Hate; he foamed at mouth,
 His breath was hot upon the air,
His breath scorched souls, as a dry drought
 Withers green trees and burns them bare.

    VIII.

Straight drives he at his enemy,
 His hairy hands grip lance in rest,
His lance it gleams full bitterly,

    IX.

Love's grey eyes glow with a heaven-heat,
 Love lifts his hand in a saintly prayer;
Look!  Hate hath fallen at his feet!
 Look!  Hate hath vanished in the air!

    X.

Then all the throng looked kind on all;
 Eyes yearned, lips kissed, dumb souls were freed;
Two magic maids' hands lifted a pall
 And the dead knight, Heart, sprang on his steed.

    XI.

Then Love cried, "Break me his lance, each knight!
 Ye shall fight for blood-athirst Fame no more!"
And the knights all doffed their mailed might
 And dealt out dole on dole to the poor.

    XII.

Then dove-flights sanctified the plain,
 And hawk and sparrow shared a nest.
And the great sea opened and swallowed Pain,
 And out of this water-grave floated Rest




I
burning-flower from Sparta, the beautiful sea-flower
Cut in clear stone, crowned with the fragrant golden mane, she
the ageless, the uncontaminable-
This Clytemnestra was her sister, low-statured, fierce-lipped, not
dark nor blonde, greenish-gray-eyed,
Sinewed with strength, you saw, under the purple folds of the
Standing between the gilded wooden porch-pillars, great steps of
stone above the steep street,
Awaiting the King.
Most of his men were quartered on the town;
he, clanking bronze, with fifty
a hundred in the street and a hundred
Lining the ramp, eighty on the great flags of the porch; she
raising her white arms the spear-butts
Thundered on the stone, and the shields clashed; eight shining
clarions
Let fly from the wide window over the entrance the wildbirds of
their metal throats, air-cleaving
Over the King come home. He raised his thick burnt-colored
beard and smiled; then Clytemnestra,
Gathering the robe, setting the golden-sandaled feet carefully,
stone by stone, descended
One half the stair. But one of the captives marred the comeliness
of that embrace with a cry
Gull-shrill, blade-sharp, cutting between the purple cloak and
the bronze plates, then Clytemnestra:
Who was it? The King answered: A piece of our goods out of
the snatch of Asia, a daughter of the king,
So treat her kindly and she may come into her wits again. Eh,
You've not been the poorer for me.- In heart, in the widowed
chamber, dear, she pale replied, though the slaves
Toiled, the spearmen were faithful. What's her name, the slavegirl's?
AGAMEMNON Come up the stair. They tell me my kinsman's
Lodged himself on you.
CLYTEMNESTRA Your cousin Aegisthus? He was out of refuge,
flits between here and Tiryns.
Dear: the girl's name?
AGAMEMNON Cassandra. We've a hundred or so other
captives; besides two hundred
Rotted in the hulls, they tell odd stories about you and your
guest: eh? no matter: the ships
Ooze pitch and the August road smokes dirt, I smell like an
old shepherd's goatskin, you'll have bath-water?
CLYTEMNESTRA
They're making it hot. Come, my lord. My hands will pour it.
(They enter the palace.)
CASSANDRA
In the holy city,
In Troy, when the stone was standing walls and the ash
Was painted and carved wood and pictured curtains,
And those lived that are dead, they had caged a den
Of wolves out of the mountain, and I a maiden
Was led to see them: it stank and snarled,
The smell was the smell here, the eyes were the eyes
Let me die easily.
So cried Cassandra the daughter of King Priam, treading the steps
of the palace at Mycenae.
Swaying like a drunken woman, drunk with the rolling of the
ship, and with tears, and with prophecy.
The stair may yet be seen, among the old stones that are Mycenae;
tall dark Cassandra, the prophetess,
captive, shamefully stained
With the ship's filth and the sea's, rolled her dark head upon her
shoulders like a drunken woman
And trod the great stones of the stair. The captives, she among
them, were ranked into a file
On the flagged porch, between the parapet and the spearmen.
The people below shouted for the King,
King Agamemnon, returned conqueror, after the ten years of
battle and death in Asia.
Then cried Cassandra:
Good spearmen you did not kill my father, not you
Violated my mother with the piercing
That makes no life in the womb, not you defiled
My tall blond brothers with the masculine lust
That strikes its loved one standing,
And leaves him what no man again nor a girl
Ever will gaze upon with the eyes of desire:
Therefore you'll tell me
Whether it's an old custom in the Greek country
The cow goring the bull, break the inner door back
And see in what red water how cloaked your King
Bathes, and my brothers are avenged a little.
One said: Captive be quiet. And she: What have I to be quiet for,
you will not believe me.
Such wings my heart spreads when the red runs out of any
Greek, I must let the bird fly. O soldiers
He that mishandled me dies! The first, one of your two brute
Aj axes, that threw me backward
On the temple flagstones, a hard bride-bed, I enduring him
heard the roofs of my city breaking,
The roar of flames and spearmen: what came to Ajax? Out of a
cloud the loud-winged falcon lightning
Came on him shipwrecked, clapped its wings about him, clung
to him, the violent flesh burned and the bones
Broke from each other in that passion; and now this one, returned
While she yet spoke a slave with haggard eyes darted from the
door; there were hushed cries and motions
issued, smiling. She drew
Her cloak up, for the brooch on the left shoulder was broken; the
fillet of her hair had come unbound;
spoke: Men of Mycenae, I have made
Sacrifice for the joy this day has brought to us, the King come
home, the enemy fallen, fallen,
In the ashes of Asia. I have made sacrifice. I made the prayer
with my own lips, and struck the bullock
With my own hand. The people murmured together, She's not
What has she done there, what wild sayings
CLYTEMNESTRA I have something to tell you.
Too much joy is a message-bearer of misery.
A little is good; but come too much and it devours us. Therefore
we give of a great harvest
pour the quarter. No man
Rides into the house in the last basket. I have been twelve years
And I am accountable for you.
CASSANDRA
Why should a man kill his own mother?
The cub of the lion being grown
Will fight with the lion, but neither lion nor wolf
Nor the unclean jackal
Bares tooth against the womb that he dropped out of:
Yet I have seen
CLYTEMNESTRA
Strike that captive woman with your hand, spearman; and then
if the spirit
Of the she-wolf in her will not quiet, with the butt of the spear.
CASSANDRA -the blade in the child's hand
Enter the breast that the child sucked-that woman's-
The left breast that the robe has dropped from, for the brooch is
broken,
That very hillock of whiteness, and she crying, she kneeling
(The spearman 'who is nearest CASSANDRA covers her mouth
twith his hand.)
CLYTEMNESTRA
My sister's beauty entered Troy with too much gladness. They
forgot to make sacrifice.
Therefore destruction entered; therefore the daughters of Troy
cry out in strange dispersals, and this one
Grief has turned mad. I will not have that horror march under
the Lion-gate of Mycenae
That split the citadel of Priam. Therefore I say I have made
sacrifice; I have subtracted
A fraction from immoderate joy. For consider, my people,
the army. King Agamemnon,
My dear, my husband, my lord and yours,
whose folly
Brought many times many great evils
On all the heads and fighting hopes of the Greek force. Why,
even before the fleet made sail,
While yet it gathered on Boeotian Aulis, this man offended. He
slew one of the deer
Of the sacred herd of Artemis, out of pure impudence, hunter's
pride that froths in a young boy
Laying nock to string of his first bow: this man, grown, a grave
king, leader of the Greeks.
Blew therefore from the horn of the Trojan shore storm without
end, no slackening, no turn, no slumber
Of the eagle bound to break the oars of the fleet and split the
hulls venturing: you know what answer
Calchas the priest gave: his flesh must pay whose hand did the
evil-his flesh! mine also. His? My daughter.
They knew that of my three there was one that I loved.
Blameless white maid, my Iphigenia, whose throat the knife,
Whose delicate soft throat the thing that cuts sheep open was
drawn across by a priest's hand
And the soft-colored lips drained bloodless
That had clung here-here- Oh!
(Drawing the robe from her breasts.)
These feel soft, townsmen; these are red at the tips, they have
neither blackened nor turned marble.
King Agamemnon hoped to pillow his black-haired breast upon
them, my husband, that mighty conqueror,
Come home with glory. He thought they were still a woman's,
they appear a woman's. I'll tell you something.
Since fawn slaughtered for slaughtered fawn evened the debt
these that feel soft and warm are wounding ice,
They ache with their hardness . . .
Shall I go on and count the other follies of the King? The
That brought down plague, and brought Achilles' anger against
Against all hope: therefore rejoice.
But lest too much rejoicing slay us I have made sacrifice. A little
girl's brought you over the sea.
What could be great enough for safe return? A sheep's death?
A bull's? What thank-offering?
All these captives, battered from the ships, bruised with captivity,
damaged flesh and forlorn minds?
he demands. I dared. I, I,
Dared.
Men of the Argolis, you that went over the sea and you that
guarded the home coasts
And high stone war-belts of the cities: remember how many
spearmen these twelve years have called me
What I bring you is accomplished.
VOICES
King Agamemnon. The King. We will hear the King.
CLYTEMNESTRA What I bring you is accomplished.
Accept it, the cities are at peace, the ways are safe between
You will not refuse it . 
VOICES The King. We will hear the King. Let
us see the King.
CLYTEMNESTRA
You will not refuse it; I have my faithful They would run, the
red rivers,
From the gate and by the graves through every crooked street
of the great city, they would run in the pasture
Outside the walls: and on this stair: stemmed at this entrance-
CASSANDRA
Ah, sister, do you also behold visions? I was watching red
water-
CLYTEMNESTRA
Be wise, townsmen. As for the King: slaves will bring him to you
when he has bathed; you will see him.
The slaves will carry him on a litter, he has learned Asian ways in
Asia, too great a ruler
To walk, like common spearmen.
CASSANDRA Who is that, standing behind
Dark in the doorway?
CLYTEMNESTRA Deal you with your own demons. You
know what I have done, captive. You know
I am holding lions with my two eyes: if I turn and loose
them . . .
CASSANDRA It is . . . the King. There! There! Ah!
CLYTEMNESTRA
Or of I should make any move to increase confusion. If I should
say for example, Spearman
Kill that woman. I cannot say it this moment; so little as from
one spear wound in your body
A trickle would loose them on us.
CASSANDRA Yet he stands behind you.
A-ah! I can bear it. I have seen much lately
Worse.
A CAPTAIN (down the stair; standing forward from his men)
lives), may ask you to speak
Otherwise than you will. You have spoken in riddles to the
people . . .
CASSANDRA Not me! Why will you choose
Me! I submitted to you living, I was forced, you entered me . . .
THE CAPTAIN Also there was a slave here,
Whose eyes stood out from his chalk face, came buzzing from
the palace postern gate, whimpering
A horrible thing. I killed him. But the men have heard it.
CASSANDRA You were the king, I was your slave.
Here you see, here, I took the black-haired breast of the bull,
I endured it, I opened my thighs, I suffered
The other thing besides death that you Greeks have to give
us . 
THE CAPTAIN Though this one raves and you are silent,
CASSANDRA That was the slave's part: but this
time . . . dead King . . .
I
will . . . not submit. Ah! Ah! No!
If you will steal the body of someone living take your wife's,
take that soldier's there
THE CAPTAIN
stone chamber; she increases confusion,
The soldiers cannot know some terrible thing may not have
happened; you men and the King's grin
Like wolves over the kill, the whole city totters on a swordedge
over sudden
CASSANDRA (screaming)
Drive him off me! Pity, pity!
I have no power; I thought when he was dead another man would
use me, your Greek custom,
Not he, he, newly slain.
He is driving me out, he enters, he possesses, this is my last defilement.
Ah . . . Greeks . . .
Pity Cassandra!
With the voice the spirit seemed to fly out.
She upflung her shining
Arms with the dreadful and sweet gesture of a woman surrendering
utterly to force and love,
She in the eyes of the people, like a shameless woman, and fell
writhing, and the dead King's soul
Captain: and you,
soldiers, that shift unsoldierly
The weapons that should be upright, at attention, like stiff
grass-blades: and you, people of Mycenae:
While this one maddened, and you muttered, echoing together,
and you, soldier, with anxious questions
Increased confusion: who was it that stood firm, who was it that
stood silent, who was it that held
With her two eyes the whole city from splitting wide asunder?
And now I will answer what you asked.
It is true. . . . He
has died.
My little son Orestes will grow up and govern you.
While she
spoke the body of Cassandra
Arose among the shaken spears, taller than the spears, and stood
among the waving spears
Stone-quiet, like a high war-tower in a windy pinewood, but
deadly to look at, with blind and tyrannous
people of Mycenae: quietness is wisdom.
No tumult will call home a dead man out of judgment. The end
is the end. Ah, soldiers! Down spears!
What, now Troy's fallen you think there's not a foreigner in
the world bronze may quench thirst on? Lion-cubs,
If you will tear each other in the lair happy the wolves, happy
the hook-nose vultures.
you, you will hear me out before you whistle
The foul beaks from the mountain nest. I tell you I will forget
mercy if one man moves now.
I rule you, I.
shall not one drop of the blood of the city
lower,
And the great ghost of the King: my slaves will bring out the
King's body decently before you
And set it here, in the eyes of the city: spices the ships bring from
the south will comfort his spirit;
Mycenae and Tiryns and the shores will mourn him aloud; sheep
will be slain for him; a hundred beeves
Spill their thick blood into the trenches; captives and slaves go
down to serve him, yes all these captives
Burn in the ten-day fire with him, unmeasured wine quench it,
urned in pure gold the gathered ashes
Rest forever in the sacred rock; honored; a conqueror. . . .
Slaves, bring the King out of the house.
Alas my husband! she cried, clutching the brown strands of her
hair in both her hands, you have left me
A woman among lions! Ah, the King's power, ah the King's
victories! Weep for me, Mycenae!
Widowed of the King!
The people stood amazed, like sheep that
snuff at their dead shepherd, some hunter's
Ill-handled arrow having struck him from the covert, all by
mischance; he is fallen on the hillside
Between the oak-shadow and the stream; the sun burns his dead
face, his staff lies by him, his dog
Licks his hand, whining. So, like sheep, the people
Regarded that dead majesty whom the slaves brought out of the
house on a gold bed, and set it
Between the pillars of the porch. His royal robe covered his
wounds, there was no stain
Nor discomposure.
Then that captain who had spoken before:
The punishment: tell us who has done this. She raised her head,
and not a woman but a lioness
Blazed at him from her eyes: Dog, she answered, dog of the
army,
Who said Speak dog, and you dared speak? Justice is mine.
Then he was silent; but Cassandra's
Body standing tall among the spears, over the parapet, her body
but not her spirit
Cried with a man's voice: Shall not even the stones of the stair,
shall not the stones under the columns
Speak, and the towers of the great wall of my city come down
against the murderess? O Mycenae
I yearned to night and day under the tents by Troy, O Tiryns,
O Mycenae, the door
Of death, and the gate before the door!
CLYTEMNESTRA That woman lies, or the
spirit of a lie cries from her. Spearman,
Kill that woman!
But Cassandra's body set its back against the
parapet, its face
Terribly fronting the raised knife; and called the soldier by his
name, in the King's voice, saying
Sheathe it; and the knife lowered, and the soldier
Fell on his knees before the King in the woman's body; and the
body of Cassandra cried from the parapet:
Horrible things, horrible things this house has witnessed: but here
is the most vile, that hundreds
Of spears are idle while the murderess, Clytemnestra the murderess,
the snake that came upon me
Naked and bathing, the death that lay with me in bed, the death
that has borne children to me,
Stands there unslain.
CLYTEMNESTRA Cowards, if the bawling of that bewildered
heifer from Troy fields has frightened you
How did you bear the horns of her brothers? Bring her to me.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA
Let no man doubt, men of Mycenae,
She has yet the knife hid in her clothes, the very blade that
stabbed her husband and the blood is on it.
Look, she handles it now. Look, fellows. The hand under the
robe. Slay her not easily, that she-wolf.
Do her no honor with a spear! Ah! If I could find the word, if
I could find it,
The name of her, to say husband-slayer and bed-defiler, bitch
and wolf-bitch, king's assassin
And beast, beast, beast, all in one breath, in one word: spearmen
You would heap your shields over this woman and crush her
slowly, slowly, while she choked and screamed,
No, you would peel her bare and on the pavement for a bridebed
with a spear-butt for husband
Dig the lewd womb until it burst: this for Agamemnon, this for
Aegisthus Agh, cowards of the city
Do you stand quiet?
CLYTEMNESTRA Truly, soldiers,
I think it is he verily. No one could invent the abominable voice,
the unspeakable gesture,
The actual raging insolence of the tyrant. I am the hand ridded
the Argolis of him.
I here, I killed him, I, justly.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA You have heard her, you have
heard her, she has made confession.
Now if she'll show you the knife too
CLYTEMNESTRA Here. I kept it for safety.
And, as that beast said, his blood's yet on it.
Look at it, with so little a key I unlocked the kingdom of destruction.
Lead home this ghost to the dark country
So many Greeks have peopled, through his crimes, his violence,
his insolence, stand firm till that moment
And through the act of this hand and of this point no man shall
suffer anything again forever
Of Agamemnon.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA
I say if you let this woman live, this crime go
unpunished, what man among you
Will be safe in his bed? The woman ever envies the man, his
strength, his freedom, his loves.
Her envy is like a snake beside him, all his life through, her envy
and hatred: law tames that viper:
It will be poison in your meat or a knife to bleed you sleeping.
They fawn and slaver over us
And then we are slain.
CLYTEMNESTRA (to one of the slaves that carried the King’s
body)
Is my lord Aegisthus
Slain on the way? How long? How long?
(To the people) He
came, fat with his crimes.
Greek valor broke down Troy, your valor, soldiers, and the brain
of Odysseus, the battle-fury of Achilles,
The stubborn strength of Menelaus, the excellence of you all:
this dead man here, his pride
Ruined you a hundred times: he helped nowise, he brought bitter
destruction: but he gathered your glory
For the cloak of his shoulders. I saw him come up the stair, I saw
my child Iphigenia
Killed for his crime; I saw his harlot, the captive woman there,
crying out behind him, I saw . . .
I saw
I saw . . . how can I speak what crowd of the dead
faces of the faithful Greeks,
Your brothers, dead of his crimes; those that perished of plague
and those that died in the lost battles
After he had soured the help of Achilles for another harlot
those dead faces of your brothers,
Some black with the death-blood, many trampled under the
hooves of horses, many spotted with pestilence,
Flew all about him, all lamenting, all crying out against him,
horrible horrible I gave them
Vengeance; and you freedom.
(To the slave) Go up and look,
Look toward the mountain. Bring me word quickly, my strength
breaks,
How can I hold all the Argolis with my eyes forever? I alone?
Hell cannot hold her dead men,
Keep watch there-send me word by others-go, go!
(To the people) He
came triumphing.
Magnificent, abominable, all in bronze.
I brought him to the bath; my hands undid the armor;
My hands poured out the water;
Dead faces like flies buzzed all about us;
He stripped himself before me, loathsome, unclean, with laughter;
The labors of the Greeks had made him fat, the deaths of the
faithful had swelled his belly;
I threw a cloak over him for a net and struck, struck, struck,
Blindly, in the steam of the bath; he bellowed, netted,
And bubbled in the water;
All the stone vault asweat with steam bellowed;
And I undid the net and the beast was dead, and the broad vessel
Stank with his blood.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA
If ever I gave you bulls teach me that word, the name for her,
the name for her!
A SLAVE (running from the door; to CLYTEMNESTRA)
approaches the Lion-gate.
CLYTEMNESTRA It is time. I am tired now.
Meet him and tell him to come in the postern doorway.
THE CAPTAIN (on the stair: addressing the soldiers and the people
below)
city into gray ashes
We must make haste. Judge now and act. For the husband-slayer
I say she must die, let her pay forfeit. And for the great ghost
of the King, let all these captives,
But chiefly the woman Cassandra, the crier in a man's voice there,
be slain upon his pyre to quiet him.
(To the soldiers above, on the ramp and the porch)
Comrades: Mycenae is greater
die: let the city live. Comrades,
We suffered something in Asia, on the stranger's coast, laboring
for you. We dreamed of home there
In the bleak wind and drift of battle; we continued ten years,
laboring and dying; we accomplished
The task set us; we gathered what will make all the Greek cities
glorious, a name forever;
We shared the spoil, taking our share to enrich Mycenae. O but
our hearts burned then, O comrades
But our hearts melted when the great oars moved the ships, the
water carried us, the blue sea-waves
Slid under the black keel; I could not see them, I was blind with
tears, thinking of Mycenae.
We have come home. Behold the dear streets of our longing,
The stones that we desired, the steep ways of the city and the
sacred doorsteps
Reek and steam with pollution, the accursed vessel
Spills a red flood over the floors.
A common murderess. Comrades join us
will mourn together at the King's burying,
And a good year will come, we will rejoice together.
CLYTEMNESTRA Dog, you dare
something. Fling no spear, soldiers,
He has a few fools back of him would attempt the stair if the
dog were slain: I will have no one
Killed out of need.
ONE OF HER MEN ON THE PORCH (flinging his spear)
Not at him: at you
Murderess!
great bronze tip grazing her shoulder
Clanged on the stones behind: the gong of a change in the dance:
now Clytemnestra, none to help her,
One against all, swayed raging by the King's corpse, over the
golden bed: it is said that a fire
Stood visibly over her head, mixed in the hair, pale flames and
radiance.
CLYTEMNESTRA Here am I, thieves, thieves,
Drunkards, here is my breast, a deep white mark for cowards to
aim at: kings have lain on it.
No spear yet, heroes, heroes?
See, I have no blemish: the arms are white, the breasts are deep
and white, the whole body is blemishless:
You are tired of your brown wives, draw lots for me, rabble,
thieves, there is loot here, shake the dice, thieves, a game yet!
One of you will take the bronze and one the silver,
One the gold, and one me,
Me Clytemnestra a spoil worth having:
Kings have kissed me, this dead dog was a king, there is another
King at the gate: thieves, thieves, would not this shining
Breast brighten a sad thief's hut, roll in his bed's filth
Shiningly? You could teach me to draw water at the fountain,
A dirty child on the other hip: where are the dice? Let me
throw first, if I throw sixes
I choose my masters: closer you rabble, let me smell you.
Don't fear the knife, it has king's blood on it, I keep it for an
ornament,
It has shot its sting.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA Fools, fools, Strike!
Are your hands dead?
CLYTEMNESTRA You Would see all of me
Before you choose whether to kill or dirtily cherish? If what
the King's used needs commending
To the eyes of thieves for thieves' use: give me room, give me
room, fellows, you'll see it is faultless.
The dress . . . there . . .
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA Fools this wide whore played wife
When she was going about to murder me the King; you, will
you let her trip you
With the harlot's trick? Strike! Make an end!
CLYTEMNESTRA I have not my
sister's, Troy's flame's beauty, but I have something.
This arm, round, firm, skin without hair, polished like marble:
the supple-jointed shoulders:
Men have praised the smooth neck, too,
The strong clear throat over the deep wide breasts . . .
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA She is
buying an hour: sheep: it may be Aegisthus
Is at the Lion-gate.
CLYTEMNESTRA If he were here, Aegisthus,
I’d not be the pedlar of what trifling charms I have for an
hour of life yet. You have wolves' eyes:
Yet there is something kindly about the blue ones there yours,
young soldier, young soldier. . . . The last,
The under-garment? You won't buy me yet? This dead dog,
The King here, never saw me naked: I had the night for nurse:
turn his head sideways, the eyes
Are only half shut. If I should touch him, and the blood came,
you'd say I had killed him. Nobody, nobody,
Killed him: his pride burst.
Ah, no one has pity!
I can serve well, I have always envied your women, the public ones.
Who takes me first? Tip that burnt log onto the flagstones,
This will be in a king's bed then. Your eyes are wolves' eyes:
So many, so many, so famishing
I will undo it, handle me not yet, I can undo it . 
Or I will tear it.
And when it is off me then I will be delivered to you beasts . . .
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA
Then strip her and use her to the bones, wear her through, kill
her with it.
CLYTEMNESTRA
When it is torn
You'll say I am lovely: no one has seen before . . .
It won't tear: I'll slit it with this knife
(Aegisthus, with many spearmen, issues from the great door.
CLYTEMNESTRA stabs right and left with the knife; the
men are too close to strike her with their long spears.)
CLYTEMNESTRA
It's time. Cowards, goats, goats. Here! Aegisthus!
Aegisthus
I am here. What have they done?
CLYTEMNESTRA
Nothing: clear the porch: I have done something. Drive them
on the stair!
Three of them I've scarred for life: a rough bridegroom, the
rabble, met a fierce bride.
(She catches up her robe.)
I held them with my eyes, hours, hours. I am not tired. . . .
My lord, my lover:
I have killed a twelve-point stag for a present for you: with my
own hands: look, on the golden litter.
You arrive timely.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA
Tricked, stabbed, shamed, mocked at, the spoil of a lewd woman,
despised
I lie there ready for her back-stairs darling to spit on. Tricked,
stabbed, sunk in the drain
And gutter of time. I that thundered the assault, I that mustered
the Achaeans. Cast out of my kingdom,
Cast out of time, out of the light.
CLYTEMNESTRA One of the captives, dear.
It left its poor wits
Over the sea. If it annoys you I'll quiet it. But post your sentinels.
All's not safe yet, though I am burning with joy now.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA O single-eyed
glare of the sky
Flying southwest to the mountain: sun, through a slave's eyes,
My own broken, I see you this last day; my own darkened, no
dawn forever; the adulterers
Will swim in your warm gold, day after day; the eyes of the
murderess will possess you;
nor sky loves justice; and having tasted
The toad that serves women for heart. From now on may all
bridegrooms
Marry them with swords. Those that have borne children
Their sons rape them with spears.
CLYTEMNESTRA More yet, more, more, more,
while my hand's in? It's not a little
You easily living lords of the sky require of who'd be like you,
who'd take time in the triumph,
Build joy solid. Do we have to do everything? I have killed
what I hated:
Kill what I love? The prophetess said it, this dead man says it:
my little son, the small soft image
That squirmed in my arms be an avenger? Love, from your loins
Seed: I begin new, I will be childless for you. The child my son,
the child my daughter!
Though I cry I feel nothing.
AEGISTHUS O strongest spirit in the world.
We have dared enough, there is an end to it.
We may pass nature a little, an arrow-flight,
But two shots over the wall you come in a cloud upon the feasting
CLYTEMNESTRA
Dear: make them safe. They may try to run away, the children.
Set spears to watch them: no harm, no harm,
But stab the nurse if they go near a door. Watch them, keep the
gates, order the sentinels,
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA The sun's gone; that glimmer's
I'll come in a moment.
CLYTEMNESTRA (at the head of the great stairs)
Soldiers: townsmen: it seems
I am not at the end delivered to you: dogs, for the lion came:
the poor brown and spotted women
Will have to suffice you. But is it nothing to have come within
handling distance of the clear heaven
Is it nothing to you?
It is something to me to have felt the fury
And concentration of you: I will not say I am grateful: I am
not angry: to be desired
I had nearly enough.
Mycenae is my city. If you grin at me
I have spears: also Tiryns and all the country people of the
Argolis will come against you and swallow you,
Empty out these ways and walls, stock them with better subjects.
A rock nest for new birds here, townsfolk:
You are not essential.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA. I hear him calling through the shewolf's
noise, Agamemnon, Agamemnon,
CLYTEMNESTRA So choose.
What choices? To reenter my service
Unpunished, no thought of things past, free of conditions . . .
Or dine at this man's table, have new mouths made in you to
eat bronze with.
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA Who is Agamemnon?
CLYTEMNESTRA
You letting go of the sun: is it dark the land you are running
away to?
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA It is dark.
CLYTEMNESTRA IS it Sorrowful?
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA
There is nothing but misery.
CLYTEMNESTRA Has any man ever come back thence?
THE BODY OF CASSANDRA No man has ever.
CLYTEMNESTRA
Go then, go, go down. You will not choose to follow him, people
of the rock-city? No one
Will choose to follow him. I have killed: it is easy: it may be
I shall kill nearer than this yet:
But not you, townsfolk, you will give me no cause; I want
security; I want service, not blood.
I have been desired of the whole city, publicly; I want service,
not lust. You will make no sign
Of your submission; you will not give up your weapons; neither
shall your leaders be slain;
And he that flung the spear, I have forgotten his face.
AEGISTHUS (entering) Dearest,
they have gone, the nurse and the children,
No one knows where.
CLYTEMNESTRA I am taming this people: send men after
them. If any harm comes to the children
Bring me tokens. I will not be in doubt, I will not have the arch
fall on us. I dare
What no one dares. I envy a little the dirty mothers of the city.
O, O!
Nothing in me hurts. I have animal waters in my eyes, but the
spirit is not wounded. Electra and Orestes
Are not to live when they are caught. Bring me sure tokens.
CASSANDRA Who is this woman like a beacon
Lit on the stair, who are these men with dogs' heads?
I have ranged time and seen no sight like this one.
CLYTEMNESTRA
Have you returned, Cassandra? . . . The dead king has gone
down to his place, we may bury his leavings.
CASSANDRA
I have witnessed all the wars to be; I am not sorrowful
For one drop from the pail of desolation
Spilt on my father's city; they were carrying it forward
To water the world under the latter starlight.
CLYTEMNESTRA (to her slaves)
Take up the poles of the bed; reverently; careful on the stair;
give him to the people. (To the people) O soldiers
This was your leader; lay him with honor in the burial-chapel;
guard him with the spears of victory;
Mourn him until to-morrow, when the pyre shall be built.
Ah, King of men, sleep, sleep, sleep!
. . . But when shall I?
They are after their corpse, like
dogs after the butcher's cart. Cleomenes, that captain
With the big voice: Neobulus was the boy who flung the spear
and missed. I shall not miss
When spear-flinging-time comes. . . . Captive woman, you have
seen the future, tell me my fortune.
(Aegisthus comes from the doorway.)
Aegisthus,
Have your hounds got them?
AEGISTHUS I've covered every escape with men,
they'll not slip through me. But commanded
To bring them here living.
CLYTEMNESTRA That's hard: tigresses don't do it: I
have some strength yet: don't speak of it
And I shall do it.
AEGISTHUS It is a thing not to be done: we'll guard them
closely: but mere madness
Lies over the wall of too-much.
CLYTEMNESTRA King of Mycenae, new-crowned
king, who was your mother?
AEGISTHUS Pelopia.
What mark do you aim at?
CLYTEMNESTRA And your father?
AEGISTHUS Thyestes.
CLYTEMNESTRA And her father?
AEGISTHUS The
same man, Thyestes.
CLYTEMNESTRA
See, dearest, dearest? They love what men call crime, they have
taken her crime to be the king of Mycenae.
Here is the stone garden of the plants that pass nature: there is
no too-much here: the monstrous
Old rocks want monstrous roots to serpent among them. I will
have security. I'd burn the standing world
Up to this hour and begin new. You think I am too much used
for a new brood? Ah, lover,
I have fountains in me. I had a fondness for the brown cheek
of that boy, the curl of his
lip,
The widening blue of the doomed eyes
I will be spared
nothing. Come in, come in, they'll have news for us.

CASSANDRA
If anywhere in the world
Were a tower with foundations, or a treasure-chamber
With a firm vault, or a walled fortress
That stood on the years, not staggering, not moving
As the mortar were mixed with wine for water
And poppy for lime: they reel, they are all drunkards,
The piled strengths of the world: no pyramid
In bitter Egypt in the desert
But skips at moonrise; no mountain
Over the Black Sea in awful Caucasus
But whirls like a young kid, like a bud of the herd,
Under the hundredth star: I am sick after steadfastness
Watching the world cataractlike
Pour screaming onto steep ruins: for the wings of prophecy
Take home the gift of the bridleless horse
The stallion, the unbitted stallion: the bed
Naked to the sky on Mount Ida,
The soft clear grass there,
Be blackened forever, may vipers and Greeks
In that glen breed
Come golden from the sun
Gave me for a bride-gift prophecy and I took it for a treasure:
I a fool, I a maiden,
I would not let him touch me though love of him maddened me
Till he fed me that poison, till he planted that fire in me,
The girdle flew loose then.

blocks of Mycenae's acropolis;
Monstrous they seemed to her, solid they appeared to her, safe
rootage for monstrous deeds: Ah fierce one
Who knows who laid them for a snare? What people in the
world's dawn breathed on chill air and the vapor
Of their breath seemed stone and has stood and you dream it is
established? These also are a foam on the stream
Of the falling of the world: there is nothing to lay hold on:
No crime is a crime, the slaying of the King was a meeting of
two bubbles on the lip of the cataract,
One winked . . . and the killing of your children would be
nothing: I tell you for a marvel that the earth is a dancer,
The grave dark earth is less quiet than a fool's fingers,
That old one, spinning in the emptiness, blown by no wind in
vain circles, light-witted and a dancer.
CLYTEMNESTRA (entering)
You are prophesying: prophesy to a purpose, captive woman.
My children, the boy and the girl,
Have wandered astray, no one can find them.
CASSANDRA Shall I tell the lioness
Where meat is, or the she-wolf where the lambs wander astray?
CLYTEMNESTRA But look into the darkness
And foam of the world: the boy has great tender blue eyes,
brown hair, disdainful lips, you'll know him
By the gold stripe bordering his garments; the girl's eyes are
my color, white her clothing
CASSANDRA Millions
Of shining bubbles burst and wander
On the stream of the world falling . . .
CLYTEMNESTRA These are my children!
CASSANDRA I see
mountains, I see no faces.
CLYTEMNESTRA
Tell me and I make you free; conceal it from me and a soldier's
spear finishes the matter.
CASSANDRA
I am the spear's bride, I have been waiting, waiting for that
ecstasy
CLYTEMNESTRA (striking her) Live then. It will not be unpainful.
(CLYTEMNESTRA goes in.)
CASSANDRA
O fair roads north where the land narrows
Over the mountains between the great gulfs,
that I too with the King's children
Might wander northward hand in hand.
Mine are worse wanderings:
They will shelter on Mount Parnassus,
For me there is no mountain firm enough,
The storms of light beating on the headlands,
The storms of music undermine the mountains, they stumble
and fall inward,
Such music the stars
Make in their courses, the vast vibration
Plucks the iron heart of the earth like a harp-string.
Iron and stone core, O stubborn axle of the earth, you also
Dissolving in a little time like salt in water,
What does it matter that I have seen Macedon
Roll all the Greek cities into one billow and strand in Asia
The anthers and bracts of the flower of the world?
That I have seen Egypt and Nineveh
Crumble, and a Latian village
Plant the earth with javelins? It made laws for all men, it dissolved
like a cloud.
I have also stood watching a storm of wild swans
Rise from one river-mouth . . . O force of the earth rising,
O fallings of the earth: forever no rest, not forever
From the wave and the trough, from the stream and the slack,
from growth and decay: O vulture-
Pinioned, my spirit, one flight yet, last, longest, unguided,
Try into the gulf,
Over Greece, over Rome, you have space O my spirit for the
years

II
Are not few of captivity: how many have I stood here
Go in and out of the gate, wearing light linen
For summer and the wet spoils of wild beasts
In the season of storms: and the stars have changed, I have
watched
The grievous and unprayed-to constellations
Pile steaming spring and patient autumn
Over the enduring walls: but you over the walls of the world,
Over the unquieted centuries, over the darkness-hearted
Millenniums wailing thinly to be born, O vulture-pinioned
Try into the dark,
Watch the north spawn white bodies and red-gold hair,
Race after race of beastlike warriors; and the cities
Burn, and the cities build, and new lands be uncovered
In the way of the sun to his setting
go on farther, what
profit
In the wars and the toils? but I say
Where are prosperous people my enemies are, as you pass them
O my spirit
Curse Athens for the joy and the marble, curse Corinth
For the wine and the purple, and Syracuse
For the gold and the ships; but Rome, Rome,
With many destructions for the corn and the laws and the javelins,
the insolence, the threefold
Abominable power: pass the humble
And the lordships of darkness, but far down
Smite Spain for the blood on the sunset gold, curse France
For the fields abounding and the running rivers, the lights in the
cities, the laughter, curse England
For the meat on the tables and the terrible gray ships, for old
laws, far dominions, there remains
A mightier to be cursed and a higher for malediction
When America has eaten Europe and takes tribute of Asia, when
the ends of the world grow aware of each other
And are dogs in one kennel, they will tear
The master of the hunt with the mouths of the pack: new fallings,
new risings, O winged one
No end of the fallings and risings? An end shall be surely,
Though unnatural things are accomplished, they breathe in the
sea's depth,
They swim in the air, they bridle the cloud-leaper lightning to
carry their messages:
Though the eagles of the east and the west and the falcons of
the north were not quieted, you have seen a white cloth
Cover the lands from the north and the eyes of the lands and the
claws of the hunters,
The mouths of the hungry with snow
Were filled, and their claws
Took hold upon ice in the pasture, a morsel of ice was their
catch in the rivers,
That pure white quietness
Waits on the heads of the mountains, not sleep but death, will
the fire
Of burnt cities and ships in that year warm you my enemies?
The frost, the old frost,
Like a cat with a broken-winged bird it will play with you,
It will nip and let go; you will say it is gone, but the next
Season it increases: O clean, clean,
White and most clean, colorless quietness,
Without trace, without trail, without stain in the garment, drawn
down
To my sore hurt: I am growing to come to another: O grave
and kindly
Last of the lords of the earth, I pray you lead my substance
Speedily into another shape, make me grass, Death, make me
stone,
Make me air to wander free between the stars and the peaks;
but cut humanity
Out of my being, that is the wound that festers in me,
Not captivity, not my enemies: you will heal the earth also,
Death, in your time; but speedily Cassandra.
You rock-fleas hopping in the clefts of Mycenae,
Suckers of blood, you carrying the scepter farther, Persian,
Emathian,
Roman and Mongol and American, and you half-gods
Indian and Syrian and the third, emperors of peace, I have seen
on what stage
You sing the little tragedy; the column of the ice that was before
on one side flanks it,
The column of the ice to come closes it up on the other: audience
nor author
I have never seen yet: I have heard the silence: it is I Cassandra,
Eight years the bitter watchdog of these doors,
Have watched a vision
And now approach to my end. Eight years I have seen the
phantoms
Walk up and down this stair; and the rocks groan in the night,
the great stones move when no man sees them.
And I have forgotten the fine ashlar masonry of the courts of my
father. I am not Cassandra
But a counter of sunrises, permitted to live because I am crying
to die; three thousand,
Pale and red, have flowed over the towers in the wall since I was
here watching; the deep east widens,
The cold wind blows, the deep earth sighs, the dim gray finger
of light crooks at the morning star.
The palace feasted late and sleeps with its locked doors; the last
drunkard from the alleys of the city
Long has reeled home. Whose foot is this then, what phantom
Toils on the stair?
A VOICE BELOW Is someone watching above? Good sentinel I
am only a girl beggar.
I would sit on the stair and hold my bowl.
CASSANDRA I here eight years have
begged for a thing and not received it.
THE VOICE
You are not a sentinel? You have been asking some great boon,
out of all reason.
CASSANDRA No: what the meanest
Beggar disdains to take.
THE GIRL BEGGAR Beggars disdain nothing: what is it that
they refuse you?
CASSANDRA What's given
Even to the sheep and to the bullock.
THE GIRL Men give them salt, grass
they find out for themselves.
CASSANDRA Men give them
The gift that you though a beggar have brought down from the
north to give my mistress.
THE GIRL You speak riddles.
I am starving, a crust is my desire.
CASSANDRA Your voice is young though
winds have hoarsened it, your body appears
Flexible under the rags: have you some hidden sickness, the
young men will not give you silver?
THE GIRL
I have a sickness: I will hide it until I am cured. You are not
a Greek woman?
CASSANDRA But you
Born in Mycenae return home. And you bring gifts from Phocis:
for my once master who's dead
Vengeance; and for my mistress peace, for my master the King
peace, and, by-shot of the doom's day,
Peace for me also. But I have prayed for it.
THE GIRL I know you, I knew
you before you spoke to me, captive woman,
And I unarmed will kill you with my hands if you babble
prophecies.
That peace you have prayed for, I will bring it to you
If you utter warnings.
CASSANDRA To-day I shall have peace, you cannot
Eight years ago I watched you and your brother going north
Move in my eyes: I would not tell her where you were when
she commanded me: I will not betray you
To-day either: it is not doleful to me
To see before I die generations of destruction enter the doors
of Agamemnon.
Where is your brother?
ELECTRA Prophetess: you see all: I will tell you
nothing.
CASSANDRA He has well chosen his ambush,
It is true Aegisthus passes under that house to-day, to hunt in
the mountain.
ELECTRA Now I remember
Your name. Cassandra.
CASSANDRA Hush: the gray has turned yellow, the
standing beacons
Stream up from the east; they stir there in the palace; strange,
is it not, the dawn of one's last day's
Like all the others? Your brother would be fortunate if to-day
were also
The last of his.
ELECTRA He will endure his destinies; and Cassandra hers;
and Electra mine.
He has been for years like one tortured with fire: this day will
quench it.
CASSANDRA They are opening the gates: beg now.
To your trade, beggar-woman.
THE PORTER (coming out) Eh, pillar of miseries,
You still on guard there? Like a mare in a tight stall, never lying
down. What's this then?
A second ragged one? This at least can bend in the middle and
sit on a stone.
ELECTRA Dear gentleman
I am not used to it, my father is dead and hunger forces me to
beg, a crust or a penny.
THE PORTER
This tall one's licensed in a manner. I think they'll not let two
bundles of rag
Camp on the stair: but if you'd come to the back door and please
me nicely: with a little washing
It'd do for pastime.
ELECTRA I was reared gently: I will sit here, the King
will see me,
And none mishandle me.
THE PORTER I bear no blame for you.
I have not seen you: you came after the gates were opened.
(He goes in.)
CASSANDRA
O blossom of fire, bitter to men,
Watchdog of the woeful days,
How many sleepers
Bathing in peace, dreaming themselves delight,
All over the city, all over the Argolid plain, all over the dark
earth,
(Not me, a deeper draught of peace
And darker waters alone may wash me)
Do you, terrible star, star without pity,
Wolf of the east, waken to misery.
To the wants unaccomplished, to the eating desires,
To unanswered love, to hunger, to the hard edges
And mold of reality, to the whips of their masters.
They had flown away home to the happy darkness,
They were safe until sunrise.
(King Aegisthus, with his retinue, comes from the great
door.)
AEGISTHUS
Even here, in the midst of the city, the early day
Has a clear savor. (To ELECTRA) What, are you miserable, holding
the bowl out?
We'll hear the lark to-day in the wide hills and smell the mountain.
I'd share happiness with you.
What's your best wish, girl beggar?
ELECTRA It is covered, my lord, how
should a beggar
Know what to wish for beyond a crust and a dark corner and a
little kindness?
AEGISTHUS Why do you tremble?
ELECTRA
I was reared gently; my father is dead.
AEGISTHUS Stand up: will you take
service here in the house? What country
Bred you gently and proved ungentle to you?
ELECTRA I have wandered
north from the Eurotas, my lord,
Begging at farmsteads.
use you kindly. She'll be coming
In a moment, then I'll speak for you. -Did you bid them yoke
the roans into my chariot, Menalcas,
The two from Orchomenus?
ONE OF THE RETINUE Yesterday evening, my lord,
I sent to the stable.
AEGISTHUS They cost a pretty penny, we'll see how they
carry it. She's coming: hold up your head, girl.
(CLYTEMNESTRA, with two serving-women, comes from
the door.)
CLYTEMNESTRA
Good hunt, dearest. Here's a long idle day for me to look to.
Kill early, come home early.
AEGISTHUS
There's a poor creature on the step who's been reared nicely
and slipped into misery. I said you'd feed her,
And maybe find her a service. Farewell, sweet one.
CLYTEMNESTRA Where did she come from? How long have you
been here?
AEGISTHUS She says she has begged her way up from Sparta.
The horses are stamping on the cobbles, good-by, good-by.
(He goes down the stair with his huntsmen.)
CLYTEMNESTRA Good-by, dearest. Well. Let me see your face.
ELECTRA It is filthy to look at. I am ashamed.
CLYTEMNESTRA (to one of her serving-women) Leucippe do
you think this is a gayety of my lord's, he's not used to be
so kindly to beggars?
-Let me see your face.
LEUCIPPE She is very dirty, my lady. It is possible one of the
house-boys . . .
CLYTEMNESTRA I say draw that rag back, let me see your face.
I'd have him whipped then.
ELECTRA It was only in hope that someone would put a crust
in the bowl, your majesty, for I am starving. I didn't think
your majesty would see me.
CLYTEMNESTRA Draw back the rag.
ELECTRA I am very faint and starving but I will go down; I am
ashamed.
CLYTEMNESTRA Stop her, Corinna. Fetch the porter, Leucippe.
You will not go so easily. (ELECTRA sinks down on the steps
indeed, when even the beggars refuse my bidding.
(LEUCIPPE comes in 'with the porter.) You have a dirty stair,
porter. How long has this been here?
THE PORTER O my lady it has crept up since I opened the doors,
it was not here when I opened the doors.
CLYTEMNESTRA Lift it up and uncover its face. What is that
cry in the city? Stop: silent: I heard a cry . . .
Prophetess, your nostrils move like a dog's, what is that shouting?
. . .
I have grown weak, I am exhausted, things frighten me . 
Tell her to be gone, Leucippe, I don't wish to see her, I don't
wish to see her.
(ELECTRA rises.)
CLYTEMNESTRA No
no
be gone.
ELECTRA (uncovering her face)
Mother: I have come home: I am humbled. This house keeps
a dark welcome
For those coming home out of far countries.
CLYTEMNESTRA I Won't look: how
could I know anyone? I am old and shaking.
He said, Over the wall beyond nature
I will not kill what I gave life to.
Whoever you are, go, go, let me grow downward to the grave
quietly now.
ELECTRA I cannot
Go: I have no other refuge. Mother! Will you not kiss me, will
you not take me into the house,
Your child once, long a wanderer? Electra my name. I have
begged my way from Phocis, my brother is dead there,
Who used to care for me.
CLYTEMNESTRA Who is dead, who?
ELECTRA My brother Orestes,
Killed in a court quarrel
CLYTEMNESTRA (weeping) Oh, you lie! The widening blue
blue eyes,
The little voice of the child . . . Liar.
ELECTRA It is true. I have wept
long, on every mountain. You, mother,
Have only begun weeping. Far off, in a far country, no fit
burial . . .
CLYTEMNESTRA And do you bringing
Bitterness
or lies . . . look for a welcome? I have only
loved two:
The priest
killed my daughter for a lamb on a stone and now
you say the boy too . . . dead, dead?
The world's full of it, a shoreless lake of lies and floating rumors
. . . pack up your wares, peddler,
treacherous beast, that shouting comes nearer,
What's in the city?
ELECTRA I am a stranger, I know nothing of the city,
I know only
My mother hates me, and Orestes my brother
Died pitifully, far off.
CLYTEMNESTRA Too many things, too many things call
me, what shall I do? Electra,
Electra help me. This comes of living softly, I had a lion's
strength
Once.
ELECTRA Me for help? I am utterly helpless, I had help in my
brother and he is dead in Phocis.
Give me refuge: but each of us two must weep for herself, one
sorrow. An end of the world were on us
What would it matter to us weeping? Do you remember him,
Mother, mother?
CLYTEMNESTRA I have dared too much: never dare anything,
Electra, the ache is afterward,
At the hour it hurts nothing. Prophetess, you lied.
You said he would come with vengeance on me: but now he is
dead, this girl says: and because he was lovely, blue-eyed,
And born in a most unhappy house I will believe it. But the
world's fogged with the breath of liars,
And if she has laid a net for me . . .
I'll call up the old lioness lives yet in my body, I have dared,
I have dared, and tooth and talon
Carve a way through. Lie to me?
ELECTRA Have I endured for months,
with feet bleeding, among the mountains,
Between the great gulfs alone and starving, to bring you a lie
now? I know the worst of you, I looked for the worst,
Mother, mother, and have expected nothing but to die of this
home-coming: but Orestes
Has entered the cave before; he is gathered up in a lonely mountain
quietness, he is guarded from angers
In the tough cloud that spears fall back from.
CLYTEMNESTRA Was he still beautiful?
The brown mothers down in the city
Keep their brats about them; what it is to live high! Oh!
Tell them down there, tell them in Tiryns,
Tell them in Sparta,
her wrists, for the boy, for the boy
Born of her body, whom she, fool, fool, fool,
Drove out of the world. Electra,
Make peace with me.
Oh, Oh, Oh!
I have labored violently all the days of my life for nothing--
nothing-worse than anything- this death
Was a thing I wished. See how they make fools of us.
Amusement for them, to watch us labor after the thing that will
tear us in
pieces. . . . Well, strength's good.
And not go mad now.
ELECTRA Mother, what are the men
With spears gathering at the stair's foot? Not of Mycenae by
their armor, have you mercenaries
Wanting pay? Do they serve . . . Aegisthus?
CLYTEMNESTRA What men? I seem
not to know . . .
Who has laid a net for me, what fool
For me, me? Porter, by me.
Leucippe, my guards; into the house, rouse them. I am sorry
for him,
I am best in storm. You, Electra?
The death you'll die, my daughter. Guards, out! Was it a lie?
No matter, no matter, no matter,
Here's peace. Spears, out, out! They bungled the job making
me a woman. Here's youth come back to me,
And all the days of gladness.
ORESTES (a sword in his hand, 'with spearmen following, comes
from the door) Where is that woman
ELECTRA Brother: let her not speak, kill quickly.
Is the other one safe now?
ORESTES That dog
Fell under his chariot, we made sure of him between the wheels
and the hooves, squealing. Now for this one.
CLYTEMNESTRA
Wait. I was weeping, Electra will tell you, my hands are wet
still,
For your blue eyes that death had closed she said away up in
Phocis. I die now, justly or not
Is out of the story, before I die I'd tell you wait, child, wait.
Did I quiver
Or pale at the blade? I say, caught in a net, netted in by my
enemies, my husband murdered,
Myself to die, I am joyful knowing she lied, you live, the only
creature
Under all the spread and arch of daylight
That I love, lives.
ELECTRA The great fangs drawn fear craftiness now,
kill quickly.
CLYTEMNESTRA As for her, the wife of a shepherd
Suckled her, but you
These very breasts nourished: rather one of your northern
spearmen do what's needful; not you
beware them.
Openly commanded.
CLYTEMNESTRA Ah, child, child, who has mistaught you and
How was it different from a man's and did you see him? Who
sent the priest presents? They fool us,
Phocis has lent you counsel as he lent you
Men: let one of them do it. Life's not jewel enough
That I should plead for it: this much I pray, for your sake, not
with your hand, not with your hand, or the memory
Will so mother you, so glue to you, so embracing you,
Not the deep sea's green day, no cleft of a rock in the bed of
the deep sea, no ocean of darkness
Outside the stars, will hide nor wash you. What is it to me that
I have rejoiced knowing you alive,
child, O precious to me, O alone loved, if now dying by my
manner of death
I make nightmare the heir, nightmare, horror, in all I have of
you;
And you haunted forever, never to sleep dreamless again, never
to see blue cloth
But the red runs over it; fugitive of dreams, madman at length,
the memory of a scream following you houndlike,
Inherit Mycenae? Child, for this has not been done before, there
is no old fable, no whisper
Out of the foundation, among the people that were before our
people, no echo has ever
Moved among these most ancient stones, the monsters here, nor
stirred under any mountain, nor fluttered
Under any sky, of a man slaying his mother. Sons have killed
fathers
ORESTES And a woman her son's father
CLYTEMNESTRA
O many times: and these old stones have seen horrors: a house
of madness and blood
I married into: and worse was done on this rock among the older
people before: but not this,
Not the son his mother; this the silent ones,
The old hard ones, the great bearers of burden have not seen yet,
Nor shall, to-day nor yet to-morrow, nor ever in the world.
Let her do it, it is not unnatural,
The daughter the mother; the little liar there,
Electra do it. Lend her the blade.
ELECTRA Brother though the great house
is silent hark the city,
That buzzes like the hive one has dipped a wand in. End this.
Then look to our safety.
ORESTES Dip in my sword
Into my fountain? Did I truly, little and helpless,
Lie in the arms, feed on the breast there?
ELECTRA Another, a greater, lay
in them, another kissed the breast there,
You forget easily, the breaker of Asia, the over-shadower, the
great memory, under whose greatness
We have hung like hawks under a storm, from the beginning,
and he when this poison destroyed him
Was given no room to plead in.
ORESTES Dip my wand into my fountain?
CLYTEMNESTRA Men do not kill the meanest
Without defence heard
ELECTRA Him-Agamemnon?
CLYTEMNESTRA But you, O my son, my son,
Moulded in me, made of me, made of my flesh, built with my
blood, fed with my milk, my child
I here, I and no other, labored to bear, groaning-
ELECTRA This that
makes beastlike lamentation
Hunted us to slay us, we starving in the thicket above the stream
three days and nights watched always
Her hunters with spears beating the field: prophetess was it for
love that she looked after us?
CASSANDRA That love
The King had tasted; that was her love.
ELECTRA And mourning for our
father on the mountain we judged her;
ORESTES If they'd give me time, the pack there how can I
think,
And all the whelps of Mycenae yelling at the stair-foot? Decision:
a thing to be decided:
The arm's lame, dip in, dip in? Shut your mouths, rabble.
CLYTEMNESTRA There is one thing no man can do.
ORESTES What, enter
his fountain?
ELECTRA
O coward!
ORESTES I will be passive, I'm blunted. She's not this fellow's
mother.
ELECTRA O spearman, spearman, do it!
One stroke: it is just.
THE SPEARMAN As for me, my lord . . .
CLYTEMNESTRA (calling loudly) Help, help, men
Rush the stair, there are only ten hold it. Up, up, kill.
ORESTES I will kill.
CLYTEMNESTRA (falling on her knees) Child,
Spare me, let me live! Child! Ai! . . .
ELECTRA You have done well.
ORESTES I have done
I have done . . .
Who ever saw such a flow . . . was I made out of this, I'm not
red, am I?
See, father?
It was someone else did it but I told him to. Drink, drink, dog.
Drink dog.
He reaches up a tongue between the stones, lapping it. So thirsty
old dog, uh?
Rich and sticky.
CLYTEMNESTRA (raising herself a little) Sleep
for me . 
yes.
Not you . . . any more . . . Orestes
I shall be there. You
will beg death . . . vainly as I have begged . . . life. Ah
. . . beast that I unkennelled! (She dies.)
ORESTES (crouching by her) Ooh . . . Ooh . . .
ELECTRA
The face is lean and terrible. Orestes!
They are fighting on the stair. Man yourself. Come. Pick up the
sword.
Let her be, two of ours are down, they yield on the stair. Stand
up, speak or fight, speak to the people
Or we go where she is.
ORESTES There's a red and sticky sky that you
can touch here.
And though it's unpleasant we are at peace.
ELECTRA (catching up the sword) Agamemnon failed
here. Not in me. Hear, Mycenaeans.
I am Agamemnon's daughter, we have avenged him, the crime's
paid utterly.
You have not forgotten the great King what, in eight years?
I am Electra, I am his daughter.
My brother is Orestes. My brother is your King and has killed
his murderers. The dog Aegisthus is dead,
ORESTES (standing up) Must I dip my wand
into my fountain, give it to me.
The male plaything. (He catches ELECTRA'S army snatching at
the sword.)
ELECTRA For what? Be quiet, they have heard me.
ORESTES You said I must do it, I will do it.
ELECTRA It is done!
Brother, brother? (ORESTES takes the sword from her by force.)
O Mycenae
With this sword he did justice, he let it fall, he has retaken it,
He is your King.
ORESTES Whom must I pierce, the girl that plotted with
me in the mountain? There was someone to kill . . .
Sweet Electra?
ELECTRA It is done, it is finished!
CASSANDRA The nearest, the most
loved, her, truly. Strike! Electra,
My father has wanted vengeance longer.
THE PEOPLE BELOW Orestes, Orestes!
ELECTRA (pointing to CASSANDRA) Her
your mother she killed him.
ORESTES (turning and striking) How tall you have grown,
mother.
CASSANDRA (falling) I
waited long for it . 
ORESTES
I have killed my mother and my mother-two mothers-see,
there they lie-I have gone home twice. You put it in
And the flesh yields to it
(He goes down the stair.) Now,
to find her again
All through the forest . . .
ELECTRA Let him pass, Mycenaeans. Avoid his
sword. Let him pass, pass. The madness of the house
Perches on him.
A LEADER OF THE MYCENAEANS Daughter of Agamemnon,
You with constancy and force
In the issueless thing have found an issue. Now it is for us the
kingless city
To find a ruler. Rest in the house. As for the young man,
Though he has done justice, and no hand in Mycenae is raised
against him, for him there is no issue.
We let him go on; and if he does not slay himself with the red
sword he will die in the mountain.
With us be peace. Rest in the house, daughter of Agamemnon.
The old madness, with your brother,
Go out of our gates.
ELECTRA A house to rest in!
Gather up the
dead: I will go in; I have learned strength.

III
They carried the dead down the great stair; the slaves with pails
of water and sand scoured the dark stains.
The people meeting in another place to settle the troubled city
the stair was left vacant,
The porch untrampled, and about twilight one of the great
stones: the world is younger than we are,
Yet now drawing to an end, now that the seasons falter. Then
another, that had been spared the blood-bath:
What way do they falter? There fell warm rain, the first answered,
in the midst of summer. A little afterward
Cold rain came down; and sand was rubbed over me as when the
winds blow. This in the midst of summer.
I did not feel it, said the second sleepily. And a third: The
noisy and very mobile creatures
Will be quieted long before the world's end. What creatures?
The active ones, that have two ends let downward,
A mongrel race, mixed of soft stone with fugitive water. The
night deepened, the dull old stones
Droned at each other, the summer stars wheeled over above them.
Before dawn the son of Agamemnon
Came to the stair-foot in the darkness.
ORESTES O stones of the house:
I entreat hardness: I did not live with you
Long enough in my youth.
I will go up to where I killed
her. . . . We must face things down, mother,
Or they'd devour us.
Nobody? . . . Even the stones have
been scrubbed. A keen housekeeper, sweet Electra.
.  It would be childish to forget it; the woman has certainly
been killed, and I think it was I
Her son did it. Something not done before in the world. Here is
the penalty:
You gather up all your forces to the act, and afterward
Silence, no voice, no ghost, vacancy, but all's not expended.
Those powers want bitter action. No object.
Deeds are too easy. Our victims are too fragile, they ought to have
thousands of lives, you strike out once only
The sky breaks like a bubble. . . . No, wife of Aegisthus, why
should I mask it? mother, my mother,
The one soft fiber that went mad yesterday's
Burnt out of me now, there is nothing you could touch if you
should come; but you have no power, you dead
Are a weak people. This is the very spot: I was here, she here:
and I walk over it not trembling,
Over the scrubbed stones to the door. (He knocks with the
sword-hilt.) They sleep well. But my sister having all her
desire
Better than any. (He knocks again.)
THE PORTER (through the door) Who is there?
ORESTES The owner of the house. Orestes.
THE PORTER Go away, drunkard.
ORESTES Shall I tell my servants to break in the door and whip
the porter?
THE PORTER Oh, Oh! You men from Phocis, stand by me while
I speak to the door. (Having opened the door, holding a
torch.) Is it you truly, my lord? We thought, we thought
.  we pray you to enter the house, my lord Orestes.
ORESTES You are to waken my sister.
I'll speak with her here.
ELECTRA (at the door) Oh! You are safe, you are well! Did you
think I could be sleeping? But it is true,
I have slept soundly. Come, come.
ORESTES A fellow in the forest
Told me you'd had the stone scrubbed
I mean, that you'd
entered the house, received as Agamemnon's daughter
In the honor of the city. So I free to go traveling have come with
what's the word, Electra? farewell.
Have come to bid you farewell.
ELECTRA It means you are going somewhere?
Come into the house, Orestes, tell me . 
ORESTES
The cape's rounded. I have not shipwrecked.
ELECTRA Around the rock
we have passed safely is the hall of this house,
The throne in the hall, the shining lordship of Mycenae.
ORESTES No:
the open world, the sea and its wonders.
You thought the oars raked the headland in the great storm
what, for Mycenae?
ELECTRA Not meanest of the Greek cities:
Whose king captained the world into Asia. Have you suddenly
Agamemnon's royalty? O come in, come in. I am cold, cold.
I pray you.
ORESTES Fetch a cloak, porter.
If I have outgrown the city a little


I have earned it. Did you
notice, Electra, she caught at the sword
As the point entered: the palm of her right hand was slashed to
the bone before the mercy of the point
Slept in her breast: the laid-open palm it was that undermined
me . . . Oh, the cloak. It's a blond night,
Well walk on the stones: no chill, the stars are mellow. If I dare
remember
Yesterday . . . because I have conquered, the soft fiber's burnt
out.
ELECTRA You have conquered: possess: enter the house,
Take up the royalty.
ORESTES You were in my vision to-night in the
forest, Electra, I thought I embraced you
More than brotherwise . . . possessed, you call it
entered
the fountain
ELECTRA Oh, hush. Therefore you would not kill her!
ORESTES
I killed. It is foolish to darken things with words. I was here, she
there, screaming. Who if not I?
ELECTRA
The hidden reason: the bitter kernel of your mind that has made
you mad: I that learned strength
Yesterday, I have no fear.
ORESTES Fear? The city is friendly and took
you home with honor, they'll pay
Phocis his wage, you will be quiet.
ELECTRA Are you resolved to understand
nothing, Orestes?
I am not Agamemnon, only his daughter. You are Agamemnon.
Beggars and the sons of beggars
May wander at will over the world, but Agamemnon has his
honor and high Mycenae
Is not to be cast.
ORESTES Mycenae for a ship: who will buy kingdom
And sell me a ship with oars?
ELECTRA Dear: listen. Come to the parapet
where it hangs over the night:
The ears at the door hinder me. Now, let the arrow-eyed stars
No one can know them, whether they be angry or pleased, tall
and terrible, standing apart,
When they make signs out of the darkness.
I cannot tell you.
. . . You will stay here, brother?
ORESTES I'll go
To the edge and over it. Sweet sister, if you've got a message for
them, the dark ones?
ELECTRA You do not mean
Death; but a wandering; what does it matter what you mean?
I know two ways and one will quiet you.
You shall choose either.
ORESTES But I am quiet. It is more regular than
a sleeping child's: be untroubled,
Yours burns, it is you trembling.
ELECTRA Should I not tremble? It is only
a little to offer,
But all that I have.
ORESTES Offer?
ELECTRA It is accomplished: my father is
avenged: the fates and the body of Electra
Are nothing. But for Agamemnon to rule in Mycenae: that is not
nothing. O my brother
You are Agamemnon: rule: take all you will: nothing is denied
And clamped the balance.
ORESTES No doubt they have done what they desired.
ELECTRA And yours,
yours? I will not suffer her
Justly punished to dog you over the end of the world. Your desire?
Speak it openly, Orestes.
She is to be conquered: if her ghost were present on the stones
let it hear you. I will make war on her
With my life, or with my body.
ORESTES What strange martyrdom, Electra,
what madness for sacrifice
Makes your eyes burn like two fires on a watch-tower, though
the night darkens?
ELECTRA What you want you shall have:
And rule in Mycenae. Nothing, nothing is denied you. If I knew
which of the two choices
Would quiet you, I would do and not speak, not ask you. Tell
me, tell me. Must I bear all the burden,
I weaker, and a woman? You and I were two hawks quartering
the field for living flesh Orestes
Under the storm of the memory
Of Agamemnon: we struck: we tore the prey, that dog and that
woman. Suddenly since yesterday
You have shot up over me and left me,
You are Agamemnon, you are the storm of the living presence,
the very King, and I, lost wings
Under the storm, would die for you. . , . You do not speak yet?
. . . Mine to say it all? . . . You know me a maiden, Orestes,
You have always been with me, no man has even touched my
cheek. It is not easy for one unmarried
And chaste, to name both choices. The first is easy. That terrible
dream in the forest: if fear of desire
Drives you away: it is easy for me not to be. I never have known
Sweetness in life: all my young days were given
ORESTES I thought to
be silent was better,
And understand you: afterwards I'll speak.
ELECTRA to the noise of
blood crying for blood, a crime to be punished,
A house to be emptied: these things are done: and now I am
lonely, and what becomes of me is not important.
There's water, and there are points and edges, pain's only a
moment: I'd do it and not speak, but nobody knows
Whether it would give you peace or madden you again, I'd not
be leagued with that bad woman against you,
And these great walls sit by the crater, terrible desires blow
through them. O brother I'll never blame you,
I share the motherhood and the fatherhood, I can conceive the
madness, if you desire too near
The fountain: tell me: I also love you: not that way, but enough
to suffer. What needs to be done
To make peace for you, tell me. I shall so gladly die to make it
for you: or so gladly yield you
What you know is maiden. You are the King; have all your will:
only remain in steep Mycenae,
In the honor of our father. Not yet: do not speak yet. You have
said it is not
Remorse drives you away: monsters require monsters, to have
let her live a moment longer
Would have been the crime: therefore it cannot be but desire
drives you: or the fear of desire: dearest,
It is known horror unlocks the heart, a shower of things hidden:
if that which happened yesterday unmasked
A beautiful brother's love and showed more awful eyes in it: all
Let me see the face, let the eyes pierce me. What, dearest? Here
in the stiff cloth of the sacred darkness
Fold over fold hidden, above the sleeping city,
By the great stones of the door, under the little golden falcons
that swarm before dawn up yonder,
In the silence . . . must I dare to woo you,
I whom man never wooed? to let my hand glide under the cloak.
. . . O you will stay! these arms
Making so soft and white a bond around you
I also begin
to love that way, Orestes,
Feeling the hot hard flesh move under the loose cloth, shudder
against me. . . . Ah, your mouth, Ah,
The burning-kiss me-
ORESTES We shall never ascend this mountain.
So it might come true: we have to be tough against them,
Our dreams and visions, or they true themselves into flesh. It is
sweet: I faint for it: the old stones here
Have seen more and not moved. A custom of the house. To
accept you, little Electra, and go my journey
To-morrow: you'd call cheating. Therefore: we shall not go up
this mountain dearest, dearest,
To-night nor ever. It's Clytemnestra in you. But the dead are a
weak tribe. If I had Agamemnon's
We'd live happily sister and lord it in Mycenae-be a king like
the others royalty and incest
Run both in the stream of the blood. Who scrubbed the stones
there?
ELECTRA Slaves. O fire burn me! Enter and lay waste,
Deflower, trample, break down, pillage the little city,
Make what breach you will, with flesh or a spear, give it to the
spoiler. See, as I tear the garment.
What if I called it cheating? Be cruel and treacherous: I'll run
my chances
On the bitter mercies of to-morrow.
ORESTES Bitter they would be. No.
ELECTRA It's clear
that for this reason
You'd sneak out of Mycenae and be lost outward. Taste first, bite
the apple, once dared and tried
Desire will be not terrible. It's doglike to run off whining. Remember
it was I that urged
Yesterday's triumph. You: life was enough: let them live. I drove
on, burning; your mind, reluctant metal,
I dipped it in fire and forged it sharp, day after day I beat and
burned against you, and forged
A sword: I the arm. Are you sorry it's done? Now again with
hammer and burning heat I beat against you,
You will not be sorry. We two of all the world, we alone,
Are fit for each other, we have so wrought . . . O eyes scorning
the world, storm-feathered hawk my hands
Caught out of the air and made you a king over this rock, O axe
with the gold helve, O star
Alone over the storm, beacon to men over blown seas, you will
not flee fate, you will take
ruler or slave the choice is,
Or a runaway slave, your pilgrim portion, buffeted over the
borders of the lands, publicly
Whipped in the cities. But you, you will bind the north-star on
your forehead, you will stand up in Mycenae
Stone, and a king.
ORESTES I am stone enough not to be changed by
words, nor by the sweet and burning flame of you,
Beautiful Electra.
ELECTRA Well then: we've wasted our night. See, there's
the morning star
I might have draggled into a metaphor of you. A fool: a boy:
no king.
ORESTES It would have been better
To have parted kindlier, for it is likely
We shall have no future meeting.
ELECTRA You will let this crime (the
Make division forever?
ORESTES Not the crime, the wakening. That deed is
past, it is finished, things past
Make no division afterward, they have no power, they have become
nothing at all: this much
I have learned at a crime's knees.
ELECTRA Yet we are divided.
ORESTES Because I
have suddenly awakened, I will not waste inward
Upon humanity, having found a fairer object.
ELECTRA Some nymph of
the field? I knew this coldness
Had a sick root: a girl in the north told me about the hill-shepherds
who living in solitude
Turn beast with the ewes, their oreads baa to them through the
matted fleece and they run mad, what madness
Met you in the night and sticks to you?
ORESTES I left the madness of the
house, to-night in the dark, with you it walks yet.
How shall I tell you what I have learned? Your mind is like a
hawk's or like a lion's, this knowledge
Is out of the order of your mind, a stranger language. To wild
beasts and the blood of kings
A verse blind in the book.
ELECTRA At least my eyes can see dawn graying:
tell and not mock me, our moment
Dies in a moment.
ORESTES Here is the last labor
To spend on humanity. I saw a vision of us move in the dark:
all that we did or dreamed of
Regarded each other, the man pursued the woman, the woman
clung to the man, warriors and kings
Strained at each other in the darkness, all loved or fought inward,
each one of the lost people
Sought the eyes of another that another should praise him; sought
never his own but another's; the net of desire
Had every nerve drawn to the center, so that they writhed like a
full draught of fishes, all matted
In the one mesh; when they look backward they see only a man
standing at the beginning,
Or forward, a man at the end; or if upward, men in the shining
bitter sky striding and feasting,
It is all turned inward, all your desires incestuous, the woman the
serpent, the man the rose-red cavern,
Both human, worship forever . . .
ELECTRA You have dreamed wretchedly.
ORESTES I have
seen the dreams of the people and not dreamed them.
As for me, I have slain my mother.
ELECTRA No more?
ORESTES And the gate's open,
the gray boils over the mountain, I have greater
Kindred than dwell under a roof. Didn't I say this would be dark
to you? I have cut the meshes
And fly like a freed falcon. To-night, lying on the hillside, sick
with those visions, I remembered
The knife in the stalk of my humanity; I drew and it broke;
I entered the life of the brown forest
And the great life of the ancient peaks, the patience of stone,
I felt the changes in the veins
In the throat of the mountain, a grain in many centuries, we have
our own time, not yours; and I was the stream
Draining the mountain wood; and I the stag drinking; and I was
the stars,
Boiling with light, wandering alone, each one the lord of his own
summit; and I was the darkness
Outside the stars, I included them, they were a part of me. I was
mankind also, a moving lichen
On the cheek of the round stone . . . they have not made words
for it, to go behind things, beyond hours and ages,
And be all things in all time, in their returns and passages, in the
motionless and timeless center,
In the white of the fire . . . how can I express the excellence
I have found, that has no color but clearness;
No honey but ecstasy; nothing wrought nor remembered; no
undertone nor silver second murmur
That rings in love's voice, I and my loved are one; no desire but
fulfilled; no passion but peace,
The pure flame and the white, fierier than any passion; no time
but spheral eternity: Electra,
Was that your name before this life dawned
ELECTRA Here is mere death.
Death like a triumph I'd have paid to keep you
A king in high Mycenae: but here is shameful death, to die because
I have lost you. They'll say
Having done justice Agamemnon’s son ran mad and was lost in
the mountain; but Agamemnon's daughter
Hanged herself from a beam of the house: O bountiful hands of
justice! This horror draws upon me
Like stone walking.
ORESTES What fills men's mouths is nothing; and your
threat is nothing; I have fallen in love outward.
If I believed you it is I that am like stone walking.
ELECTRA I can endure
even to hate you,
But that's no matter. Strength's good. You are lost. I here remember
the honor of the house, and Agamemnon's.
She turned and entered the ancient house. Orestes walked in the
clear dawn; men say that a serpent
Killed him in high Arcadia. But young or old, few years or many,
signified less than nothing
To him who had climbed the tower beyond time, consciously,
and cast humanity, entered the earlier fountain. 



I loked about, and sawe a craggy roche
Farre in the west, neare to the element; 
And as I dyd then unto it approche,
Upon the toppe I sawe refulgent
The royall tower of Morall Document,
Made of fine copper, with turrettes fayre and hye,
Which against Phebus shone so marveylously;

That for the very perfect bryghtnes,
What of the tower and of the cleare sunne,
I coulde nothyng beholde the goodliness
Of that palaice whereas Doctrine did wonee;
Tyll at the last, with mysty wyndes donne,
The radiant bryghtnes of golden Phebus
Auster gan cover with clowde tenebrus. 

Then to the tower I drewe nere and nere,
And often mused of the great hyghnes
Of the craggy rocke, whiche quadrant did appeare;
But the fayre tower so much of ryches
Was all about sexangled doubtles,
Gargeyled with greyhounds and with many lyons,
Made of fyne golde, with divers sundry dragons.

The little 'turretts' with ymages of golde
About was set, whiche with the wynde aye moved.
With propre vices that I did well beholde,
About the towers in sundry wyse they hoved,
Wyth goodly pypes in their mouthes ituned,
That with the wynde they pyped a daunce,
Iclipped Amour de la hault plesaunce.

The toure was great, of marvelous wyndes,
To whyche there was no way to passe but one,
Into the toure for to have an intres;
A grece there was, ychesyled all of stone
Out of the rocke, on whiche men dyd gone
Up to the toure; an in lykewise dyd I,
Wyth bothe the grayhoundes in my company:

Tyll that I that I came to a ryall gate,
Where I sawe stondynge the goodly portres,
Whiche axed me from whence I came a-late?
To whome I gan in every thynge expresse
All myne adventure, chaunce, and busynesse,
And eke my name I tolde her every dell.
When she herde this, she lyked me ryght well.

Her name, she sayd, was called Countenaunce:
Into the 'base' courte she dyd me then lede,
Where was a fountayne depred of pleasance,
A noble sprynge, a ryall conduytehede,
Made of fyne golde enameled with reed,
And on the toppe foure dragons blewe, and stoute
Thys dulcet water in foure partyes dyd spout.

Of whyche there flowed foure ryvers ryght clere,
Sweter than Nylus or Ganges was theyr odoure,
Tygrys or Eufrates unto them no pere.
I dyd than taste the aromatyke lycoure,
Fragraunt of fume, swete as any floure,
And in my mouthe it had a marveylous cent 
Of divers spyces; I knewe not what it ment.

And after thys father forth me brought
Dame Countenaunce into a goodly hall:
Of jasper stones it was wonderly wrought,
The wyndowes cleare, depured all of crystall,
And in the roufe on hye over all
Of golde was made a ryght crafty vyne; 
Instede of grapes the rubies there did shyne.

The flore was paved with berall clarified,
With pillers made of stones precious,
Like a place of pleasure so gayely glorified,
It might be called a palaice glorious,
So muche delectable and solacious.
The hall was hanged, hye and circuler,
With cloth of arras in the rychest maner.


That treated well of a ful noble story,
Of the doubty waye to the tower perillous;
Howe a noble knyght should wynne the victory
Of many a serpente foule and odious:
***This life is no longer safe
The only hiding spot is this cave
So I take a few steps inside
I let the tears fall as I cried
The world as I know it is burning to the ground
Everyone screamed and I can hear their sound
Who would have thought this town
With all the people I love and hate would make me frown? 


This cave is no longer lonely
Theres a light and its glowy
As I take a step toward the light
I swear there is going to be a fight
A man comes out of the shadows
The smell! It smells like meadows
Now I smell smoke

The man lunges toward me
What had I ever done to he
Who has me trapped in his hands? 
Tell me because I don't understand! 
Who is this strange man? 
I'll tell you what I can
To make you feel better
He says and hands me a letter. 

He was the one I loved
I told him I lived above
And that I've had enough
I didn't know he'd go insane
And I didn't know he'd try to gain
Me back by burning everything down
Including my family and this town! 



Goodbye, love! 
I've had too much of this, so enough! 
You need to leave
My love you won't receive
I've moved on and so must you
Why can't you get a clue? 
This is not what I wanted from you! 

So go and make this better, my old friend
For this revenge, yes it must end
Go rebuild your life with a new town
Get over me and you won't frown
So goodbye forever
And I don't ever
Want to see your face, NEVER! 



In the town of Tiddly Puddle
All the folk were in a muddle
And on Masquerade Lane
Everyone was insane
And the sheep and the cows were in trouble
But on Fawcett Avenue
Lived a man with a view
He could see down the lane
That the folk were insane
So he lay in a pile full of rubble



A Song of the Great Retreat

Dreary lay the long road, dreary lay the town, 
Lights out and never a glint o' moon: 
Weary lay the stragglers, half a thousand down, 
Sad sighed the weary big Dragoon. 
"Oh! if I'd a drum here to make them take the road again, 
Oh! if I'd a fife to wheedle, Come, boys, come! 
You that mean to fight it out, wake and take your load again, 
Fall in! Fall in! Follow the fife and drum! 

"Hey, but here's a toy shop, here's a drum for me, 
Penny whistles too to play the tune! 
Half a thousand dead men soon shall hear and see 
We're a band!" said the weary big Dragoon. 
Rubadub! Rubadub! Wake and take the road again, 
Wheedle-deedle-deedle-dee, Come, boys, come! 
You that mean to fight it out, wake and take your load again, 
Fall in! Fall in! Follow the fife and drum!" 

Cheerly goes the dark road, cheerly goes the night, 
Cheerly goes the blood to keep the beat; 
Half a thousand dead men marching on to fight 
With a little penny drum to lift their feet. 
Rubadub! Rubadub! Wake, and take the raod again, 
Wheedle-deedle-deedle-dee, Come, boys, come! 
You that mean to fight it out, wake and take your load again, 
Fall in! Fall in! Follow the fife and drum! 

As long as there's an Englishman to ask a tale of me, 
As long as I can tell the tale aright, 
We'll not forget the penny whistle's wheedle-deedle-dee 
And the big Dragoon a-beating down the night, 
Rubadub! Rubadub! Wake and take the road again, 
Wheedle-deedle-deedle-dee, Come, boys, come! 
You that mean to fight it out, wake and take your load again, 
Fall in! Fall in! Follow the fife, and drum



My little Son, who look'd from thoughtful eyes 
And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise, 
Having my law the seventh time disobey'd, 
I struck him, and dismiss'd 
With hard words and unkiss'd,
—His Mother, who was patient, being dead. 
Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep, 
I visited his bed, 
But found him slumbering deep, 
With darken'd eyelids, and their lashes yet 
From his late sobbing wet. 
And I, with moan, 
Kissing away his tears, left others of my own; 
For, on a table drawn beside his head, 
He had put, within his reach, 
A box of counters and a red-vein'd stone, 
A piece of glass abraded by the beach, 
And six or seven shells, 
A bottle with bluebells, 
And two French copper coins, ranged there with careful art, 
To comfort his sad heart. 
So when that night I pray'd 
Ah, when at last we lie with tranced breath, 
Not vexing Thee in death, 
And Thou rememberest of what toys 
We made our joys, 
How weakly understood 
Thy great commanded good, 
Then, fatherly not less 
Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay, 
Thou'lt leave Thy wrath, and say, 
'I will be sorry for their childishness.

'If possession is tenths of the law, 
How much of a fool can I be, 
I have his ring, 
But she has his heart. 


Twenty years ago, 
I was just like her, 
Perfect body, 
Well Developed mind, 
Full of goals, 
Exciting with plans. 

What has happened over the years, 
All of those goals, all of those tears, 
What ever happened to the time, 
When we could be alone, 
And just talk, 
Without being interrupted, 
No phones, 
No TV, 
Just him and me. 


Those days are gone, 
And now I'm alone, 
The problem is I'm not the only one this is happening to! 

Millions of people are across this land, 
Are trading in their older models, 
For a new brand, 
Less miles, 
Less wear and tear, 
Prettier bodies, 
Less repair. 

The only thing I can tell you from my experience, 
Don't be fooled, 
Don't listen to this, 
Talk is cheap, 
But eventually we all end up on the junk heap!



(
Lying and stealing is the white man's game;
(A practice of his throughout the whole world)
At all, great thunderbolts he has hurled;
He has stolen everywhere-land and sea;
A buccaneer and pirate he must be,
Killing all, as he roams from place to place,
Leaving disease, mongrels-moral disgrace-


(
The world's history of him is replete,
From his javelin-bolt to new-built fleet:
Hosts he has robbed and crushed below;
Of friend and neighbor he has made a foe.
From our men and women he made the slave,
Then boastingly he calls himself a brave;
Cowardly, he steals on his trusting prey,
Killing in the dark, then shouts he hoo ray!


(
Not to go back to time pre-historic,
Only when men in Nature used to frolic,
And you will find his big, long murder-list,
Showing the plunderings of his mailed fist;
Africa, Asia and America
Tell the tale in a mournful replica
How tribesmen, Indians and Zulus fell
Fleeing the murdering bandit pell mell.


(
American Indian tribes were free,
Sporting, dancing, and happy as could be;
Asia's hordes lived then a life their own,
To civilization they would have grown;
Africa's millions laughed with the sun,
In the cycle of man a course to run;
In stepped the white man, bloody and grim,
The light of these people's freedom to dim.


(
Coolies of Asiatics they quickly made,
In Africa's blacks they built a world trade,
The Red Indians they killed with the gun,
All else of men and beasts they put to run;
Blood of murderer Cain is on their head,
Of man and beast they mean to kill dead;
A world of their own is their greatest aim,
For which Yellow and Black are well to blame.


(
Out of cold old Europe these white men came,
From caves, dens, and holes, without any fame,
Eating their dead's flesh and sucking their blood,
Relics of the Mediterranean flood;
Literature, science and art they stole,
After Africa had measured each pole,
Asia taught them what great learning was,
Now they frown upon what the Coolie does.


(
They have stolen, murdered, on their way here,
Leaving desolation and waste everywhere;
Now they boastingly tell what they have done,
Seeing not the bloody crown they have won;
Millions of Blacks died in America,
Coolies, peons, serfs, too, in Asia;
Upon these dead bones Empires they builded,
Parceling out crowns and coronets gilded.


(
They have dared to tell us what is right,
In language of death-bullets, gas and might
Only with their brute force they hold us down,
Men of color, Yellow, Red, Black and Brown:
Not a fair chance give they our men to rise,


(
With the Bible they go to foreign lands,
When of the Holy One there is no dearth:
They say to us: 'You, sirs, are the heathen,
When we believe, they give to us the rod.


(I
After our confidence they have thus won,
From our dear land and treasure we must run;
Story of the Bible no more they tell,
For our souls redeemed we could go to hell.
Oil, coal and rubber, silver and gold,
They have found in wealth of our lands untold;
Thus, they claim the name of our country, all,
Of us they make then their real foot-ball.


(
If in the land we happen to tarry,
Most of us then become sad and sorry,
For a white man's country they say it is,
And with shot, gas and shell, they prove it his:
But fight, pray, watch and wait His Holy word:
His second coming we know to be true,
Then, He will greet the white man with his due-


(
After this Person around they did toss:
White men the Savior did crucify,
For eyes not blue, but blood of Negro tie;
Now they worship Him in their churches great,
And of the Holy Ghost they daily prate;
When in slavery the Blacks they entwined.


(
Their churches lines of demarcation draw;
Yet Black and White they have separated,
Then to Heaven they think they will all go,
When their consciences ought to tell them NO.
So each man must abide his final fate.


(
We'd like to see the white man converted,
And to right and justice be devoted;
Continuing in land-values to lie and steal,
Will bring destruction down upon his heel.
All that the other races want, I see,
Is the right to liberty and be free;
This the selfish white man doesn't want to give;
He alone, he thinks, has the right to live.


(
There shall be a bloody mix-up everywhere;
Of the white man's plunder we are aware:
Men of color the great cause understand,
Unite they must, to protect their own land.
No fool's stand on argument must we make;
Between Heaven and earth an oath we take:
'Our lands to deliver from foreign foes,
Caring not of trials and maudlin woes.'


(
The privilege of men to protect home
Was established before the days of Rome.
Many gallant races fought and died,
Alien hordes in triumph thus defied.
Carthage did not crush Ancient Greece
For their believing in the Golden Fleece.
No other race shall kill the sturdy Blacks
If on their tribal gods we turn our backs.


(
From Marathon, Tours, Blenheim and the Marne
A braver courage in man has been born;
Africans died at Thermopylae's Pass,
Standing firm for Persia-men of Brass.
The Black Archers of Ethiopia stood
At Marathon, proving their stern manhood;
Senegalese held their own at Verdun,
Even though their praises are not now sung.


(
In the Americas' modern warfare
The Blacks have ever borne their share;
With Cortez, Washington, too, and the rest,
We did for the others our truthful best;
At St. Domingo we struck a clear blow
To show which way the wind may one day go.
Toussaint L'Ouverture was our leader then,
At the time when we were only half-men.


(
Italians, Menelik put to chase,
Beating a retreat in uneven haste;
So down the line of history we come,
Black, courtly, courageous and handsome.
No fear have we today of any great men
From Napoleon back to Genghis Khan;
All we ask of men is 'Give a square deal,'
Returning to others same right we feel.


(
With a past brilliant, noble and grand,
Black men march to the future hand in hand;
We have suffered long from the white man's greed,
Perforce he must change his unholy creed.
Stealing, bullying and lying to all
Will drag him to ignominious fall;
For men are wise-yes, no longer are fools,
To have grafters make of them still cheap tools.


(
Each race should be proud and stick to its own,
And the best of what they are should be shown;
This is no shallow song of hate to sing,
But over Blacks there should be no white king.
Every man on his own foothold should stand,
Claiming a nation and a Fatherland!
White, Yellow and Black should make their own laws,
And force no one-sided justice with flaws.


(
Man will bear so much of imposition,
Till he starts a righteous inquisition.
History teaches this as a true fact,
Upon this premise all men do act.
Sooner or later each people take their stand
To fight against the strong, oppressive hand;
As over sin and greed He makes him tower.


(
This trite lesson the white man has Dot learnt,
Waiting until he gets his fingers burnt.
Millenniums ago, when white men slept,
The great torch of light Asia kept.
Africa at various periods shone
Above them all as the bright noonday sun;
Coming from the darkened cave and hut,
The white man opened the gate that was shut.


(
Gradually light bore down upon him,
This ancient savage who was once dim;
When he commenced to see and move around,
He found the book of knowledge on the ground;
Centuries of wonder and achievements
But, like the rest, he has now fallen flat,


(
We shall always be our brother's keeper,
Is the injunction of the Redeemer;
Love and tolerance we must ever show,
If in Grace Divine we would truly grow;
Not by the death-traps of Argonne or Somme,
When the terrible white man learns this much,
He will save even the African Dutch.


(
South Africa has a grave problem now
In reducing the Negro to the plow;
White men are to live in their lazy case
While the patience of the goodly natives tease;
They make new laws to have Africa white
Precipitating righteous and ready fight:
Around the world they speak of being so just,
Yet, in fact, no lone white man can you trust.


(
In Australia the same they have done,
And so, wherever man's confidence won:
And upon their willing slave try to foist.
Only a part of the world can you fool,
And easily reduce to your foot-stool;
The other one-half is always awake,
And from it you cannot liberty take.


(
'And now valiant Black men of the west
Must ably rise to lead and save the rest':
This is the ringing call Africa sounds,
Clansmen! black, educated, virile and true!
Let us prove too that we are loyal blue.
We must win in the blessed fight of love,
Trusting on the Maker of men above.


(
Wanton, reckless, wicked, he still remains,
Causing grief, sorrow, tears and human pains!
Seeking for earnest truth while marching on?
If so, friend, let us tell you now and here,
For love, freedom, justice let's all prepare!


(
Wonderful signs He is ever showing,
Unrest, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and storms
Are but revelations of Heavenly Forms:
The proud white scientist thinks he is wise
When He is ready, the whole world will shake.


(
The Armageddon is gathering now;
The sign is on every oppressed man's brow:
The whites who think they are ever so smart
Do not know other men can play their part:
When the opportune time is almost here
Black, Yellow and Brown will be everywhere,
In union of cause they'll stand together
And storms of the bully boldly weather.


(
Their gases and shots, and their rays of death,
Shall only be child's play-a dream of Seth,
For out of the clear, sleeping minds of ages,
Our buried arts and sciences then shall rise,
To show how for centuries we were wise:
Until of us, action, He did demand.


(
Under the canopy of Nature's law
We shall unitedly and bravely draw.
Swords, in rhythm with Divine Meter:
With Angelic strains and Seraphic hum:
The Guides of Heaven will direct the way,
Keeping us from wandering far astray.


(
Like around the high walls of Jericho,
March we, as Rio speeds through Mexico:
Trumpets loud will the Guiding Angels blow.
As scatter the enemy to-and-fro:
Heaven will have given us a battle cry:
'Oh Brave Soldiers you shall never die':
Rally to the command of Heaven's King,
As Cherubim to Him your tidings bring.


(
See the deadly clash of arms! Watch! They fall!
There is stillness!-It is the funeral pall!
A sad requiem now is to be sung!
Not by Angels. but in their human tongue!
The cruel masters of yesterday are done!
From the fields of battle they have run!
A brand new world of justice is to be!
'You shall be a true brother unto me!'


(
White man, will you turn from the evil path?
There is still hope for you, among the good:
If you will seek the bigger-brotherhood:
Stop your tricks, frauds, lying and stealing,
And settle down to fair and square dealing;
If not, prepare yourself for gloomy hell,


(
Your lies, to us called diplomacy,
Are known by us, a brazen phantasy;
You imprison men for crimes not so great,
While on your silly wisdom you do prate.
The masses are soberly watching you;
They know that you are false and so untrue.
The laborers of your race you oppress,
As well as black and other men you distress.


(
If you were wise you'd read between the lines
Of feudal isms and others of old times.
Men have fought against ugly royal gods,
Burying them 'neath European sods.
Such to heartless masters the people do,
From Syracuse to bloody Waterloo;
Wonderful lessons for any sober man,
Who worships not idols or the god Pan.


(
In the vicious order of things today,
The poor, suffering black man has no say;
The plot is set for one 'gainst the other,
With organization they mustn't bother.
'If one should show his head as a leader,
Whom we cannot use, the rest to pilfer,
We shall discredit him before his own,
And make of him a notorious clown.'


(
'In Africa we have plans to match him,
While the native Chiefs of their lands we trim;
The Blacks schooled in England are too smart,
On the I BETTER THAN YOU scheme we'll start,
And have them thinking away from the rest;
This philosophy for them is best-
Easier then we can rob the good lands
And make ourselves rich without soiled hands.'


(
'We will so keep from them the' NEGRO WORLD'
That no news they'll have of a flag unfurled;
Should they smuggle copies in, and we fail,
We will send the sly agents all to jail.'
This is the white man's plan across the sea.
Isn't this wily and vicious as can be?
In other lands they have things arranged
Differently, yet they have never changed.


(
In America they have Colored to tell
What they know of the rest, whose rights they sell;
The Blacks they do try to keep always down,
But in time they will reap what they have sown.
No Negro's good life is safe in the STATES
If he tries to be honest with his mates;
In politics he must sell at the polls,
To suit the white man in his many roles.


(
The West Indian whites are tricky, too;
They have schemes curved like the horse's shoe:
There is only one opening for the black-
Three other sides are close up to his back;
Hence he never gets a chance to look in
Whilst staring at the world of mortal sin.
Yes, this is the game they play everywhere,
Leaving the Negro to gloom and despair.


(
And now, white man, can we reason with you,
For each race in the world to give it due?
Africa for Africans is most right;
Asia for Asiatics is light;
To Europe for the Europeans,
America for the Americans:
This is the doctrine of the goodly Klan,
Now fighting for the alien ban.


(
Blacks do not hate you because you are white;
We believe in giving to all men right;
Some we do keep for ourselves to protect,
Knowing it as a virtue to select.
We are willing to be friends of mankind,
Pulling all together with none behind,
Growing in sane goodness and fellowship,
Choosing but the Almighty to worship.


(
Let Justice prevail, at home and abroad;
Cease over the weak your burdens to lord;
You're but mortal man, like the rest of us-
Of this happy truth we need make no fuss.
All Nature's kindly gifts are justly ours-
Suns, oceans, trees, to pretty flowers-
So we need not doubt the marvelous fact


(
The common thief now steals a crust of bread,
The law comes down upon his hungry head;
The haughty land robber steals continents,
With men, oil, gold, rubber and all contents.
The first you say is a hopeless convic',
While the latter escapes the law by trick;
That grave, one-sided justice will not do-
The poor call for consideration, too.


(
The rich white man starts the unholy war,
Then from the line of action he keeps far;
He pushes to the front sons of the poor,
There to do battle, die, suffer galore,
As the guns rage, liberty loans they raise,
And in glorious tones sing freedom's praise.
This is the method to gain them more wealth,
Then, after vict'ry they practice great stealth.


(
Those who make wars should first go to the front,
And of gas, shot and shell bear there the brunt:
In first lines of action they are all due,
If to their country and people they are true:
When this is demanded in right of all,
There will be no more deadly cannon ball:
The downtrodden poor whites and blacks should join
And prevent rich whites our rights to purloin.


(
Weeping mothers, tricked in patriotism,
Send their sons to fight for liberalism:
Into most far off lands they go with pride,
When they get into the bloody trenches,
They find of lies they had awful drenches:
The people they were all supposed to kill,
Like themselves, had gotten of lies their fill.


(
In the private club and drawing room,
White schemes are hatched for the nation's doom:
Speculators, grafters, bankers-all,
With politicians join to hasten the fall,
By stealing rights from other citizens,
As if they weren't fit or true denizens:
How awful is this daring story
That we tell to men young and hoary.


(
Crooked lawyers, friends and politicians,
Corrupt the morals of the good nations:
Between them and others, fly plots they make,
Innocent citizens' money to take;
From banks they find out your real account,
Then have you indicted on legal count:
Large fees they charge, to have you surely broke,
Then, to prison you go-what a sad joke!


(
The white man controls cable and wireless,
Connections by ships with force and duress:
He keeps black races of the world apart,
So to his schemes they may not be smart:
'There shall be no Black Star Line Ships,' he says,
'For that will interfere with our crooked ways:
'I'll disrupt their business and all their plans,
'So they might not connect with foreign lands.'


(
Black women are raped by the lordly white,
In colonies, the shame ne'er reaching light:
In other countries abuses are given,
Hybrids and mongrels are the open result,
Which the whites give us as shameful insult:
How can they justify this? None can tell;
Yet, crimes of the blacks are rung with a bell.


(
White men newspapers subsidize and own,
For to keep them on their racial throne:
Editors are slaves to fool the public,
Reporters tell the lie and pull the trick;
The papers support only what they want,
Yet truth, fair play, and justice, daily flaunt:
They make criminals out of honest men,
And force judges to send them to the Pen.


()
Capitalists buy up all blank space
To advertise and hold the leading place
For to influence public opinion
And o'er Chief-editors show dominion.
The average man is not wise to the scheme,
He, the reformer, must now redeem;
This isn't a smooth or very easy job,
For, you, of your honor and name, they'll rob.


(
The bankers employ men to shoot and kill,
When we interfere with their august will;
They take the savings of deaf, dumb and poor,
Gamble with it here and on foreign shore:
In oil, gold, rum, rubber they speculate,
Then bring their foreign troubles upon the State:
Friends in Government they control at will;
War they make, for others, our sons to kill.


(
The many foundations of researches,
And the foreign missions and their churches,
Are organized to catch the mild converts
Who don't understand the way of perverts.
Our wealth when discovered by researchers,
In lands of the Native occupiers
Is surveyed and marked to the river's rim
Till they dislodge a Premprey or Abd-El-Krim.


(
It is not freedom from prison we seek;
It is freedom from the big thieves we meet:
All life is now a soulless prison cell,
A wild suspense between heaven and hell:
Selfish, wicked whites have made it so;
To the Author and Finisher we'll go,
Carrying our sad cares and many wrongs
To Him in prayers and holy songs.


(
This is the game that is played all around,
Which is sure one day to each race rebound:
The world is gone mad with the money craze,
Leaving the poor man in a gloomy haze:
There must be world reorganization,
To save the masses from exploitation-,
The cry is for greater democracy.
A salvation from man's hypocrisy.


(
Out in this heartless, bitter oasis
There's now very little of human bliss;
The cold capitalists and money sharks
Have made life unsafe, like ocean barks.
The once dear, lovely Garden of Eden
Has become the sphere of men uneven;
Now man has robbed others of their share.


(
Shall there be freedom of liberal thought?
No; the white man has all agencies bought-
Press, pulpit, law and every other thing-
Hence o'er public opinion he reigns king.
This is indisputable, glaring fact;
You may find it out with a little tact.
College tutors and presidents are paid,
So that in universities schemes are laid.


(
Cleopatra, Empress Josephine,
Were black mongrels like of the Philippine:
Mixtures from black and other races they,
Yet 'true' the white man's history will not say
To those who seek the light of pure knowledge
In the inquiring world, school or college.
Napoleon fell for a Negro woman;
So did the Caesars, and the Great Roman.


(
Anthony lost his imperial crown
To escape Cleo's fascinating -frown.
This truth the New Negro knows very well,
And to his brothers in darkness he'll tell.
No one can imprison the brain of man-
You may persecute, starve, even debase-
That will not kill truth nor virtue efface.


(
The white man now enjoys his 'Vanity Fair';
He thinks of self and not of others care-
Fratricidal course, that to hell doth lead-
This is poison upon which the gentry feed.
Blacks should study physics, chemistry, more,
This is no idle prattle talk to you;
It has made the banners red, white and blue.


(
Shall rise a kingdom of Black Fraternity;
There shall be conquests o'er militant forces;
Signs of retribution are on every hand:
Be ready, black men, like Gideon's band.
They may scoff and mock at you today,
But get you ready for the awful fray.


(
There is a promised hope for the Negro race;
In the sublimest truth of prophecy,
Princes shall come out of Egypt so grand,
The noble black man's home and Motherland,
The Psalmist spoke in holy language clear,


(
In their conceit they see not their ruin;
You soldiers of trust, be up and doing!
Remember Belshazzar's last joyous feast,
And Daniel's vision of the Great Beast!
'Weighed in the balances and found wanting'
Is the Tekel to which they are pointing.
This interpretation of the Prophet
Black men shall never in their dreams forget.


(
The resplendent rays of the morning sun
Shall kiss the Negro's life again begun;
Shall stir Afric's soul without Divine flaw.
The perfume from Nature's rosy hilltops
Shall fall on us spiritual dewdrops.
Celestial beings shall know us well,
For, by goodness, in death, with them we'll dwell.



AND HOW SAD A FINIS!
With battleship, artillery and gun
Heaven and earth they have often defied.,
Taking no heed of the rebels that died.
So the evil ones shall sure have their day.
'You may rob, you may kill, for great fame,'
So says the white man, FOR THIS IS HIS GAME. 

Friends of humanity, of high and low degree,
I pray ye all come listen to me;
And truly I will relate to ye,
The tragic fate of the Rev. Alexander Heriot Mackonochie. 

Who was on a visit to the Bishop of Argyle,
For the good of his health, for a short while;
Because for the last three years his memory had been affected,
Which prevented him from getting his thoughts collected. 

'Twas on Thursday, the h of December, in the year of 
He left the Bishop's house to go and see Loch Leven;
And he was accompanied by a little skye terrier and a deerhound,
Besides the Bishop's two dogs, that knew well the ground. 

And as he had taken the same walk the day before,
The Bishop's mind was undisturbed and easy on that score;
Besides the Bishop had been told by some men,
That they saw him making his way up a glen. 

From which a river flows down with a mighty roar,
From the great mountains of the Mamore;
And this route led him towards trackless wastes eastward,
And no doubt to save his life he had struggled very hard. 

And as Mr Mackonochie had not returned at dinner time,
The Bishop ordered two men to search for him, which they didn't decline;
Then they searched for him along the road he should have returned,
But when they found him not, they sadly mourned. 

And when the Bishop heard it, he procured a carriage and pair,
While his heart was full of woe, and in a state of despair;
He organised three search parties without delay,
And headed one of the parties in person without dismay. 

And each party searched in a different way,
But to their regret at the end of the day;
Most unfortunately no discovery had been made,
Then they lost hope of finding him, and began to be afraid. 

And as a last hope, two night searches were planned,
And each party with well lighted lamps in hand
Started on their perilous mission, Mr Mackonochie to try and find,
In the midst of driving hail, and the howling wind. 

One party searched a distant sporting lodge with right good will,
Besides through brier, and bush, and snow, on the hill;
And the Bishop's party explored the Devil's Staircase with hearts full of woe,
A steep pass between the Kinloch hills, and the hills of Glencoe. 

Oh! it was a pitch dark and tempestuous night,
And the searchers would have lost their way without lamp light;
But the brave searchers stumbled along for hours, but slow,
Over rocks, and ice, and sometimes through deep snow. 

And as the Bishop's party were searching they met a third party from Glencoe side,
Who had searched bracken and burn, and the country wide;
And sorrow was depicted in each one's face,
Because of the Rev. Mr Mackonochie they could get no trace. 

But on Saturday morning the Bishop set off again,
Hoping that the last search wouldn't prove in vain;
Accompanied with a crowd of men and dogs,
All resolved to search the forest and the bogs. 

And the party searched with might and main,
Until they began to think their search would prove in vain;
When the Bishop's faithful dogs raised a pitiful cry,
Which was heard by the searchers near by. 

Then the party pressed on right manfully,
And sure enough there were the dogs guarding the body of Mackonochie;
And the corpse was cold and stiff, having been long dead,
Alas! almost frozen, and a wreath of snow around the head. 

And as the searchers gathered round the body in pity they did stare,
Because his right foot was stained with blood, and bare;
But when the Bishop o'er the corpse had offered up a prayer,
He ordered his party to'carry the corpse to his house on a bier. 

So a bier of sticks was most willingly and quickly made,
Then the body was most tenderly upon it laid;
And they bore the corpse and laid inside the Bishop's private chapel,
Then the party took one sorrowful look and bade the corpse, farewell. 

Sob of fall, and song of forest, come you here on haunting quest, 
Where the mountain pass is narrow, and the torrent white and strong, 
Down its rocky-throated canyon, sings its golden-throated song. 

And the leaning stars are listening above the distant heights 
That lift like points of opal in the crescent coronet 
About whose golden setting sweeps the trail to Lillooet. 

Trail that winds and trail that wanders, like a cobweb hanging high, 
Just a hazy thread outlining mid-way of the stream and sky, 
Where the Fraser River canyon yawns its pathway to the sea, 
But half the world has shouldered up between its song and me. 

Here, the placid English August, and the sea-encircled miles, 
Where the waterfalls and forest voice for ever their duet, 
And call across the canyon on the trail to Lillooet. 



Out of the night and the north; 
 Savage of breed and of bone, 
Shaggy and swift comes the yelping band, 
Freighters of fur from the voiceless land 
 That sleeps in the Arctic zone. 

Laden with skins from the north, 
 Beaver and bear and raccoon, 
Marten and mink from the polar belts, 
Otter and ermine and sable pelts-- 
 The spoils of the hunter's moon. 

Out of the night and the north, 
 Sinewy, fearless and fleet, 
Urging the pack through the pathless snow, 
The Indian driver, calling low, 
 Follows with moccasined feet. 

Ships of the night and the north, 
 Freighters on prairies and plains, 
Carrying cargoes from field and flood 
They scent the trail through their wild red blood, 
 The wolfish blood in their veins. 

An understanding of yourself, 
Takes a train of thought
An understanding of yourself
Takes a peace of mind


honesty, unity  different opportunity’s
Knowing the impossible lays before your eyes
Giving you the option to strive

Get on that train you’re on the path of success
Follow your will and you r freedom to progress
Every chug your chug along, 
Builds a stronger heart that beats alone
Pumping energy and unity inside something that you call me

Don’t doubt the only thing you can trust
Believe in yourself that’s a must
Tell yourself I’m comin home
A destination a realization that
I’m the driver the sole survivor
Of something that you can call me

 

May this dreary abode be for ever unknown,
 For ever, by virtue, by Pity, untrod;
Unbreathed be his name, and unhonor'd his stone;

So from the ground we felt that virtue branch 
Through all our veins till we were whole, our wrists 
As fresh and pure as water from a well, 
Our hands made new to handle holy things, 
The source of all our seeing rinsed and cleansed 
Till earth and light and water entering there 
Gave back to us the clear unfallen world. 
We would have thrown our clothes away for lightness, 
But that even they, though sour and travel stained, 
Seemed, like our flesh, made of immortal substance, 
And the soiled flax and wool lay light upon us 
Like friendly wonders, flower and flock entwined 
As in a morning field. Was it a vision? 
Or did we see that day the unseeable 
One glory of the everlasting world 
Perpetually at work, though never seen 
Since Eden locked the gate that’s everywhere 
And nowhere? Was the change in us alone, 
And the enormous earth still left forlorn, 
An exile or a prisoner? Yet the world 
We saw that day made this unreal, for all 
Was in its place. The painted animals 
Assembled there in gentle congregations, 
Or sought apart their leafy oratories, 
Or walked in peace, the wild and tame together, 
As if, also for them, the day had come. 
The shepherds’ hovels shone, for underneath 
The soot we saw the stone clean at the heart 
As on the starting-day. The refuse heaps 
Were grained with that fine dust that made the world; 
For he had said, ‘To the pure all things are pure.’ 
And when we went into the town, he with us, 
The lurkers under doorways, murderers, 
With rags tied round their feet for silence, came 
Out of themselves to us and were with us, 
And those who hide within the labyrinth 
Of their own loneliness and greatness came, 
And those entangled in their own devices, 
The silent and the garrulous liars, all 
Stepped out of their dungeons and were free. 
Reality or vision, this we have seen. 
If it had lasted but another moment 
It might have held for ever! But the world 
Rolled back into its place, and we are here, 
And all that radiant kingdom lies forlorn, 
As if it had never stirred; no human voice 
Is heard among its meadows, but it speaks 
To itself alone, alone it flowers and shines 
And blossoms for itself while time runs on. 


But he will come again, it’s said, though not 
Unwanted and unsummoned; for all things, 
Beasts of the field, and woods, and rocks, and seas, 
And all mankind from end to end of the earth 
Will call him with one voice. In our own time, 
Some say, or at a time when time is ripe. 
His agony unmade, his cross dismantled— 
Glad to be so—and the tormented wood 
Will cure its hurt and grow into a tree 
In a green springing corner of young Eden, 
And Judas damned take his long journey backward 
From darkness into light and be a child 
Beside his mother’s knee, and the betrayal 
Be quite undone and never more be done. 



During that time I kept out of circumstances that were too full of mystery
As people with stomach ailments avoid heavy meals,
I preferred to stay at home inquiring into certain questions
Concerning the propagation of spiders,
To which end I would shut myself up in the garden
And not show myself in public until late at night;
Or else, in shirt-sleeves, defiant,
I would hurl angry glances at the moon,
Trying to get rid of those bilious fancies
That cling like polyps to the human soul.
When I was alone I was completely self-possessed,
I went back and forth fully conscious of my actions
Or I would stretch out among the planks of the cellar
And dream, think up ways and means, resolve little emergency problems.
It was at that moment that i put into practice my famous method for interpreting dreams
Which consists in doing violence to oneself and then imagining what one would like,
Conjuring up scenes that I had worked our beforehand with the help of powers from other worlds.
In this manner I was able to obtain priceless information
Concerning a string of anxieties that afflict our being:
Foreign travel, erotic disorders, religious complexes.
But all precautions were inadequate,
Because, for reasons hard to set forth,
I began sliding automatically down a sort of inclined plane.
My soul lost altitude like a punctured balloon,
The instinct of self-preservation stopped functioning
And, deprived of my most essential prejudices,
I fell unavoidably into the telephone trap
Which sucks in everything around it, like a vacuum,
And with trembling hands I dialed that accursed number
Which even now I repeat automatically in my sleep.
Uncertainty and misery filled the seconds that followed,
While I, like a skeleton standing before that table from hell
Covered with yellow cretonne,
Waited for an answer from the other end of the world,
The other half of my being, imprisoned in a pit.
Those intermittent telephone noises
Worked on me like a dentist's drill,
They sank into my soul like needles shot from the sky
Until, when the moment itself arrived,
I started to sweat and to stammer feverishly,
My tongue like a veal steak
Obtruded between my being and her who was listening,
Like those black curtains that separate us from the dead.
I never wanted to conduct those over-intimate conversations
Which I myself provoked, just the same, in my stupid way,
My voice thick with desire, and electrically charged.
Hearing myself called by my first name
In that tone of forced familiarity
Filled me with a vague discomfort,
With anguished localized disturbances which I contrived to keep in check
With a hurried system of questions and answers
Which roused in her a state of pseudo-erotic effervescence
That eventually affected me as well
With a feeling of doom.
Then I'd make myself laugh and as a result fall into a state of mental prostration.
These ridiculous little chats went on for hours
Until the lady who ran the pension appeared behind the screen
Brusquely breaking off our stupid idyll.
Those contortions of a petitioner at the gates of heaven
And those catastrophes which so wore down my spirit
Did not stop altogether when I hung up
For usually we had agreed
To meet next day in a soda fountain
Or at the door of a church whose name I prefer to forget. 




I am not well civilized, really alien here: trust me not.
I can understand the guns and the airplanes,
The other conveniences leave me cold.

'We must adjust our economics to the new abundance .
Of what? Toys: motors, music-boxes,
Paper, fine clothes, leisure, diversion.

I honestly believe (but really an alien here: trust me not)
Blind war, compared to this kind of life,
Has nobility, famine has dignity.

Be happy, adjust your economics to the new abundance;
One is neither saint nor devil, to wish
The intolerable nobler alternative. 



It lives inside the traveling me
Forever
I feel like it’s there
For keeps
In everything I touch
In every word I speak
Everywhere I look
In every thought I think
From my first steps when I was My conscience  when I was The baggage I picked up along the way
And my trash when I was I got up one day and had enough
I grabbed a sack and in I stuffed
all those things that piss me off
and dumped it in my pick up truck
I started the engine
And thought I can move along
Get the wheels to turn, but
It haunted me and weighed me down
So, I thought I will get rid of it
In the next bin I found
But it took a walk and followed me
To the next stop and got in to the back seat
Where I can see
And every time I look over my shoulder
I see the little me
Why is he after me
Why can’t he just go away
And leave me alone
And let me do what I’ve got to do today
I stopped the truck and pulled him by the arm
You’re wasting my time
I told him for the last time
I drive on drive
And I wouldn’t park
Till I can prove you wrong
And show you that I’m really strong
I opened the door to get back in to my seat
And there he was again
But now in the driver’s seat
Listen to me
You can’t get rid of me
Deal with it and come with me
Face your fears
And become my friend
That’s the only thing that will make
Your nightmare end

 
Byways and bygone
And lone nights long
Sun rays and sea waves
And star and stone

Manless and friendless
No cave my home
This is my torture
My long nights, lone



Into the silence of the empty night
I went, and took my scorned heart with me,
And all the thousand eyes of heaven were bright;
But Sorrow came and led me back to thee.

I turned my weary eyes towards the sun,
Out of the leaden East like smoke came he.
I laughed and said, ' The night is past and done ' ;
But sorrow came and led me back to thee.

I turned my face towards the rising moon,
Out of the south she came most sweet to see,
She smiled upon my eyes that loathed the noon ;
But sorrow came and led me back to thee.

I bent my eyes upon the summer land,
And all the painted fields were ripe for me,
And every flower nodded to my hand ;
But Sorrow came and led me back to thee.

O Love ! O Sorrow ! O desired Despair !
I turn my feet towards the boundless sea,
Into the dark I go and heed not where,
So that I come again at last to thee,When colour goes home into the eyes,
And lights that shine are shut again 
With dancing girls and sweet birds’ cries 
Behind the gateways of the brain; 
And that no-place which gave them birth, shall close
The rainbow and the rose:— 

Still may Time hold some golden space 
Where I’ll unpack that scented store 
Of song and flower and sky and face, 
And count, and touch, and turn them o’er,
Musing upon them; as a mother, who 
Has watched her children all the rich day through 
Sits, quiet-handed, in the fading light, 
When children sleep, ere night. 



Mountains, a moment's earth-waves rising and hollowing; the
earth too's an ephemerid; the stars-
Short-lived as grass the stars quicken in the nebula and dry in their
summer, they spiral
Blind up space, scattered black seeds of a future; nothing lives
long, the whole sky's
Recurrences tick the seconds of the hours of the ages of the gulf
before birth, and the gulf
After death is like dated: to labor eighty years in a notch of
eternity is nothing too tiresome,
Enormous repose after, enormous repose before, the flash of
activity.
Surely you never have dreamed the incredible depths were prologue
and epilogue merely
To the surface play in the sun, the instant of life, what is called
life? I fancy
That silence is the thing, this noise a found word for it; interjection,
a jump of the breath at that silence;
Stars burn, grass grows, men breathe: as a man finding treasure
says 'Ah!' but the treasure's the essence;
Before the man spoke it was there, and after he has spoken he
gathers it, inexhaustible treasure. 



Words carefully written, 
Will they stand the test of time? 
The secret is emotion, 
Not in the way words rhyme.
Treasures found, 
Lessons learned, 
Put them in a chest.
No better words than I love you, 
Could ever serve you best. 



Life is a journey
 A journey of time
 Where a heart needs another
 To give it a shine
 
 We're all on a journey
 With two paths to take
 One that is right
 And the one that can break
 
 With many a set back
 We'll find hard to bear
 It's love and true friendship
 That will help us to care
 
 For a heart that is lonely
 Can fill up with strain
 Like a plant that can wither
 Without sun and rain
 
 So together when sharing
 Surely we'll find
 it's the treasure of life
 That can give peace of mind




A gardener sat beside a kind  tree
He felt her warmth and she set him free
When her leaves passed his ears
Then she whispered to him in grace
She spoke of her journey until now and then, 
'Earth', she said,  mothered me since
I was a hard seed between her grains
My kindness back to her, is fruits to be
and when the time comes or even before, 
all parts of me, for sky and earth, shall be




When the big tree falls
      Hit by lightning
      Roared by thunder

      When the big tree finally falls
      And I was there
      A big sound
      Of a giant old tree
      Falling finally to the ground

      The arrogance
      That used to be

      By that big old tree
      We all looked upon
      It was so high
      And we did not
      Climb it anyhow

      For fear
      And
      Perhaps respect for its grandeur

      And today this big tree falls
      Hit by lightning and roared by thunder

      The universe claps upon the
      Fall of arrogance and pride
      And a tree's belief about
      Its hugeness and
      Strength

      Now this tree falls
      And I am here watching it

      You are not here
      You are in some foreign country

      How can I tell you

      That this tree has fallen

      And there is nothing to fear anymore? 

      When a tree falls and you are not there
      Your logic tells

      There is no tree
      There is no tree of such strength and posture
      There is no tree like that

      That can ever fall
      All because a lightning hits it
      And all because the thunder roared

      Without you. 


Ready with leaves and with buds stood the tree.
"Shall I take them?" the frost said, now puffing with glee.
     "Oh my, no, let them stand,
      Till flowers are at hand!"
All trembling from tree-top to root came the plea.

Flowers unfolding the birds gladly sung.
"Shall I take them?" the wind said and merrily swung.
     "Oh my, no, let them stand,
      Till cherries are at hand!"
Protested the tree, while it quivering hung.

The cherries came forth 'neath the sun's glowing eye.
"Shall I take them?" a rosy young girl's eager cry.
     "Oh my, yes, you can take,
      I've kept them for your sake!"
Low bending its branches, the tree brought them nigh. 


I find it very hard to see
Why I grew up to be a tree
I grow my leaves and then they fall
I don't know why they grow at all
I'm home to insects bugs and lice
They eat my bark, which isn't nice
I'm older than the oldest man
I spread my branches where I can
But seldom have I felt at ease
For I have caught Dutch Elm disease
Yet every year I have new buds
And love my life within the woods


The tree is here, still, in pure stone,
in deep evidence, in solid beauty,
layered, through a hundred million years.
Agate, cornelian, gemstone
transmuted the timber and sap
until damp corruptions
fissured the giant's trunk
fusing a parallel being:
the living leaves
unmade themselves
and when the pillar was overthrown
fire in the forest, blaze of the dust-cloud,
celestial ashes mantled it round,
until time, and the lava, created
this gift, of translucent stone. 


I'm a thought and a plant in the raw bark
as has been the skill, wealth and handicraft
in the tree of man. 

let me hew the stony heart
till out of the emptiness
emerges the real me-the life boat
which like the empty pitcher afloat
now enjoys the grace of the wind and water, still
ferrying the timber scented forest breath
in the ocean of life. 

Partake of The Word
And live forever




Cry, and thousands we cry
A million, heckled and shackled, we cry
On this river of tears, we cry
Suppressed and oppressed we cry

The birds migrated far and wide
In search of new territories and new food
They knew there was a tree with many branches and many different fruits and longed for it

Cry, and thousands we cry
A million, heckled and shackled, we cry
On this river of tears, we cry
Suppressed and oppressed we cry

They sailed for days unending 
Down the stream they rowed
And one bright beautiful morning
With the sun hanging over the horizon
They found it

Cry, and thousands we cry
A million, heckled and shackled, we cry
On this river of tears, we cry
Suppressed and oppressed we cry

There it was, as beautiful as can be
"The tree with many branches and many different fruits "
"This is black haven, this is black gold"
They were jubilant and rejoiced
And sang into the night

Cry, and thousands we cry
A million, heckled and shackled, we cry
On this river of tears, we cry
Suppressed and oppressed we cry

Slowly they shook tail feathers as they descended 
It was murky grounds and murky waters
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
They had the long and sharp beaks to hunt the tree
"What might the tree do that we can’t fend off? "
Cold feet has no rhythm, neither does a cold heart
"Let’s go get those fruits"

Cry, and thousands we cry
A million, heckled and shackled, we cry
On this river of tears, we cry
Suppressed and oppressed we cry

The tree in mournful mode
Blaring its trunk out in mournful cry
To cries of despair, to cries of degradation
"Brace yourself the enemy is here! "
Sing as it did 
Cry as it did
The sap flowed ceaselessly 
From all the cracks and all the wounds
Not a branch spared from the vicious attack
The many branches of many different fruits
One by one, its fruits got taken away from it
Its leaves plucked away fearlessly
Till the tree was almost bare and could not fend for itself


Cry, and thousands we cry
A million, heckled and shackled, we cry
On this river of tears, we cry
Suppressed and oppressed we cry


Giant Africa, tree of many branches and many different fruits
Africa, in joyful praise
Calling on the world to shelter it
With its tress and branches pruned thin
And its leaves so long gone with the wind
So that now it’s prone to repeated hunger and disease
Heed you this notice
A new Africa is in the horizon
The new melting pot
It will be: 
The new Europe, with new trains
The New Russia with new gas
The new America with new leadership
Someday again, the birds will return
And all your beautiful branches and beautiful fruits will return
And all are welcome
The world will come under the new African umbrella
And take shade under the tree
Good, better, best, my African story


Yes! that day


On the corner of the northern cities
Silently stood rows of trees, 
Haze in grey blanket
Covered with them, they  make the dream of the spring.
They dreamed of a bright spring day
The sun shines in the blue shy, 
In the lonely silence loess  plateau, 
Primroses are smileing in the spring breeze. 


The tri-pinnacled lake. 
         The confluence of, running brooks 
         Is crowned by a cliff, glittering in the skies. 
         With Qaunsar Nag (Veshnapad) 
         The septapeaked mountain Lake is 
         Caged in a limitless VOID:EVEN the bravest that are slain	
  Shall not dissemble their surprise



On waking to find valor reign,	
  Even as on earth, in paradise; 	
And where they sought without the sword	        
  Wide fields of asphodel fore’er,	
To find that the utmost reward	
  Of daring should be still to dare.	
 
The light of heaven falls whole and white	
  And is not shattered into dyes,	        
The light for ever is morning light; 	
  The hills are verdured pasture-wise; 	
The angel hosts with freshness go,	
  And seek with laughter what to brave; —	
And binding all is the hushed snow	        
  Of the far-distant breaking wave.	
 
And from a cliff-top is proclaimed	
  The gathering of the souls for birth,	
The trial by existence named,	
  The obscuration upon earth.	        
And the slant spirits trooping by	
  In streams and cross- and counter-streams	
Can but give ear to that sweet cry	
  For its suggestion of what dreams! 	
 
And the more loitering are turned	        
  To view once more the sacrifice	
Of those who for some good discerned	
  Will gladly give up paradise.	
And a white shimmering concourse rolls	
  Toward the throne to witness there	        
The speeding of devoted souls	
 
And none are taken but who will,	
  Having first heard the life read out	
That opens earthward, good and ill,	        
  Beyond the shadow of a doubt; 	
  And tenderly, life’s little dream,	
But naught extenuates or dims,	
  Setting the thing that is supreme.	        
 
Nor is there wanting in the press	
  Some spirit to stand simply forth,	
Heroic in its nakedness,	
  Against the uttermost of earth.	
The tale of earth’s unhonored things	        
  Sounds nobler there than ’neath the sun; 	
And the mind whirls and the heart sings,	
  And a shout greets the daring one.	
 
  ’One thought in agony of strife	        
The bravest would have by for friend,	
  The memory that he chose the life; 	
But the pure fate to which you go	
  Admits no memory of choice,	
Or the woe were not earthly woe	        
  To which you give the assenting voice.’	
 
And so the choice must be again,	
  But the last choice is still the same; 	
And the awe passes wonder then,	
  And a hush falls for all acclaim.	        
  And broken it, and used therefrom	
The mystic link to bind and hold	
  Spirit to matter till death come.	
 
‘Tis of the essence of life here,	        
  Though we choose greatly, still to lack	
The lasting memory at all clear,	
  That life has for us on the wrack	
Nothing but what we somehow chose; 	
  Thus are we wholly stripped of pride	        
In the pain that has but one close,	
  Bearing it crushed and mystified.


  'It's a trick'
The magician said
As he aimed the arrow at my head
To try and split the apple there
I wish he had just split my hair
Instead he hit me in the ear
Pierced in two
That's just not fair


On a trip through life
take only pictures in your mind
leave only footprints far behind
seek only comfort from those near
live every day without fear
move every obstacle in the way
try something healthy every day
take your dreams and make them real
work hard at making others feel
the way you do about the world
and let your soul unfurl
for that is you
and you are beautiful


Like an unripe melon
Like a conquer Magellan
Like a handy capped Helen Keller
There is a moonster in the cellar
He has been there since last November
I was once a member-
Of his palace
Until I was hit in the head with a mallet

Creeping along the halls
I have spotted the moonster in conversation with the white rabbit
Me thinks that white rabbit has a nasty habit-
Of being late
Last time they nearly locked the gate
Is his clock too slow? 
Or is telling time his foe? 
At least the moonster and purple tiger know

Acid is a trip that is not a trick for kids
But the rabbits white hair show great age
Maybe his mind is like that of a mage
I saw him once pull himself out of his own hat
Very impress for a magician with a assistant gnat 
He buzzes around the rabbit’s head, a dark shade of blue 
The rabbit does not reek, I have seen him use his wife’s shampoo

If I may take the time
I must say for a rabbit his wife is a dime
I even saw her and purple tiger in the shower at the same time
Of course the white rabbit was too late to catch them of this crime
Just then I told the purple tiger not to eat the white rabbit or the Chinese Girl
"She is your world! "

You just don’t know it and she will not show it
So he devoured the loaf of bread instead


I am two fools, I know— 
For loving, and for saying so
In whining poetry;
But where's that wiseman that would not be I,
If she would not deny?
Then, as th' earths inward narrow crooked lanes
Do purge sea waters fretful salt away,
I thought, if I could draw my pains
Through rhymes vexation, I should them allay.
Grief brought to numbers cannot be so fierce,
For he tames it that fetters it in verse.

But when I have done so,
Some man, his art and voice to show,
Doth set and sing my pain,
And, by delighting many, frees again
Grief, which verse did restrain.
To Love and Grief tribute of verse belongs,
But not of such as pleases when 'tis read;
Both are increased by such songs,
For both their triumphs so are published;
And I, which was two fooles, do so grow three;
Who are a little wise, the best fools be. 





A Vision

In that bless'd season, when descending snows,
In robes of virgin white, the fields inclose;
When Beaux, and Belles, their rural seats forego,
For the gay seats of Almack's and Soho:
When to his consort's wish the sportsman yields,
And quits, for Grosvenor-Square, the frostbound fields;
What time stout Labor waking rears his head,
And jaded Luxury just thinks of bed;
Tir'd with the toilsome pleasures of the day,
Stretch'd on my couch with weary limbs I lay: 
Then, as disorder'd slumbers clos'd my eyes,
This strange fantastic vision seem'd to rise.

Methought my footsteps trod a spacious plain,
Of size, assembled nations to contain:
Expos'd to sight, nor screen'd by sheltering wood,
Full in the midst a spacious building stood.
In various ornaments, on every part,
Had Architecture lavish'd all her art;
Here Grecian columns Gothic structures bear,
Gay China spreads her painted arches there;
The artist's skill, to charm the roving view,
Had mix'd old orders, and invented new.
High in the dome, on massy pillars rear'd,
Rich with refulgent gems, a throne appear'd,
Where, deck'd in all the pomp of regal state,
'Mid gazing crouds, a female figure sat; 
And, while ten thousand tongues her power proclaim,
The vaulted roofs re-echo Fashion's name.

Round her a train of busy nymphs are seen,
Some plait her robes, her washes some prepare,
Some paint her cheeks, and some adorn her hair;
Still through perpetual change their labors run,
One moment alters, what the last had done.
Numbers each art to gain her favor try,
And watch the varying motions of her eye;
At her command employ their utmost skill,
And yield their minds, and bodies, to her will;
Lay health, and fame, and fortune, all aside,
To follow blindly where her mandates guide.
No toil seems difficult, no scheme absurd.

Pale Sickness tries each art that can avail,
To make her faded features yet more pale; 
While rosy Health's capricious fingers spread,
On her fresh blooming cheeks, a foreign red.
The weakly stripling, fainting with the pace,
Urges o'er hill, and dale, the breathless chace;
While the stout brawny youth, in languid strains,
Of tender frame, and shatter'd nerves, complains.
Nobles, whose sires for freedom bravely stood,
Or seal'd her sacred charter with their blood,
Glory their country's honor to have sold,
And prostitute their dearest rights for gold;
In Britain's cause while patriot Porters cry,
And Butchers bellow, Wilkes and Liberty!

As at this motley scene, in wild amaze,
On every side with wondering eyes I gaze,
Sudden, methought, I heard the clarion's notes;
Loud on the wind the martial clamour floats!—

The embattled legions glitter from afar,
And threaten Fashion's dome with fatal War.
Panting with rage to break her tyrant laws,
Here sprightly Wit his light-arm'd cohorts draws;
Reason, and Sense, with Virtue by their side,
In close array, their firm battalions guide;
And Beauty leads in graceful order on,
Her radiant files, that glitter in the sun.

A flush of rage her glowing features spread:
Then, frowning, thus: ‘Do these allies prepare
‘To wage with troops like mine unequal war?—
‘Soon shall my veterans o'er the purpled plain,
‘With force superior, drive the rebel train.

‘Though Wit, and Sense, their various bands combine,
‘And Virtue's powers with Beauty's squadrons join, 
‘The boldst of their tribe shall mourn, too late,
‘The rash resolve that tempts them to their fate,
‘And bids them urge a host to warlike deeds,
‘Which Dulness marshals, and which Folly leads.’

She spoke, and while her voice the war defy'd,
Assembling myriads croud on every side;
Undaunted to the field of death they go,
And frown amazement on the approaching foe:
With dreadful shock the encount'ring armies meet,
And the plain trembling, rocks beneath their feet.

Ye Nymphs of Pindus! string my feeble lyre,
And in my bosom wake Maeonian Fire!
So shall my song, in equal strains, relate,
The bleeding horrors of this field of fate. 

First Wit's impetuous train the fight began;
Full on the foe, with active force they ran.
The hardy sons of Dulness bear the shock,
Sustain the onset, and their ardor mock.
Secure from wounds they fight, no hostile reed
Can make the sacred sons of Dulness bleed:
Conceit, (whose tenfold shield's the surest fence
'Gainst all the fire of Wit, and force of Sense;
In which, when held before the warrior's heart,
No weapon finds a vulnerable part,
But from it's temper'd verge the arrows bound,
Nor leave a mark, but blunted strew the ground.)
Conceit, propitious hovering o'er their heads,
Before this favorite band her buckler spreads;
Behind it's ample round they safely lie,
And scorn the shafts of Satire, as they fly.
Weak are the attempts of Reason to sustain
The shatter'd force of Wit's defeated train; 
Alike his baffled legions quickly yield,
And still victorious Dulness keeps the field.

But different far the martial scene appears,
Where her triumphant banner Beauty rears.
Folly, and Vice, in vain their powers oppose,
Wide o'er the field her car exulting goes;
Before her bands the hostile legions fly,
And round her shining chariot myriads die:
Even Dulness learns to tremble at the sight,
Draws off her conquering sons, and shuns the fight.
Beheld the fatal fortune of the day:
Yet one remaining band some hopes afford,
To snatch the victory from her rival's sword.
From various regions drawn, a troop she had,
Of forms uncouth, in dress fantastic clad, 
The truest slaves of Fashion's potent reign,
The keenest foes to Beauty's gallant train.

A thousand arms they wield, and arts they know,
Destructive all to their triumphant foe:
Here Affectation, dress'd in fell grimace,
Distorts each feature of a lovely face;
Here Milliners and Mantua-makers join
Their cruel skill, to hide each form divine;
Above the rest, here dire Friseurs prepare
Their horrid engines, and provoke the war:
Ten thousand puffs advanc'd with dreadful power
Against the adverse host their powder shower;
The rising dust obscures the doubtful fight,
And hides the struggling armies from the sight;
Wide o'er the foe the gathering mist extends,
Full on their fronts the snowy cloud descends.
No more, by artful braidings unconfin'd,
The flaxen hair flows wanton in the wind; 
No more the auburn tresses loosely break,
In curls luxuriant, o'er the snowy neck;
Alike the sable locks their lustre lose,
And golden ringlets, sung by many a Muse.

O'er the fair train the clouds of powder fall,
And universal whiteness covers all.
Her alter'd legions Beauty scarcely knows,
And shrinks astonish'd from her shouting foes.
So when on fam'd Pharsalia's spacious stage
The world beheld her rival chiefs engage,
While Rome's luxurious youth, on Pompey's side,
Shining in arms, the strokes of death defied,
Caesar no more against each dauntless breast,
But to their eyes, his glittering spears address'd:
Those who could death in freedom's cause embrace,
Struck with the terrors of a mangled face,
From the disputed field inglorious fly,
To 'scape the horrors of deformity. 

Now Fashion's breast with eager transport beats,
While Beauty slowly from the field retreats:
But soon her warriors blast the short delight,
Assume fresh courage, and renew the fight.
Each wily stratagem is us'd in vain
To vanquish, or destroy, the lovely train;
Though every dress to hide their charms they wear,
Distort their features, and deform their hair;
To every dress superior still they rise,
Still darts the living lightning from their eyes:
Folly beholds her fainting squadrons yield,
And baffled Dulness quits at length the field.

Now, Fashion, shame had veil'd thy haughty head,
And Beauty reign'd triumphant in thy stead:
But, lo! auxiliar armies bend their way,
To rescue from her force the hard-fought day. 
These foreign aids, in four divisions drawn,
With steady footsteps march across the lawn.
Two dress'd in sable garbs their squadrons spread,
Two like Britannia's legions clad in red.
Amidst their ranks four frowning kings appear,
The embattled warriors round, a dreadful fight,
Pant for the conflict, and demand the fight.

‘Now haughty foes!’ (exulting Fashion cries)
‘Now learn my potent empire to despise!—
‘Though the disastrous shock of former arms
‘Had left ye blooming in your native charms;
‘No rouge had spread, no powder fall'n to shroud
‘Your dazzling lustre in a dusty cloud;
‘Not all your vaunted power should ever boast
‘One laurel ravish'd from yon veteran host. 
‘Elate in arms, and foremost in the field,
‘See mighty Pam his massy halberd wield!—
‘Where-e'er, by victory led, the hero goes,
‘What daring arm, undaunted, shall oppose?
‘Or who, with fearless eye, the plain explores
‘Where dreadful march yon sable Matadores?

Onward the legions rush with shouts of rage.
In vain fair Beauty calls her faithless band,
And bids each chief the fierce attack withstand;
The apostate warriors yield without a blow,
Throw down their useless arms, and kneel before the foe.

In triumph now to Fashion's ample fane
The jocund victors march across the plain;
And Beauty, hapless victim of the war!
Is chain'd a captive to her rival's car.


And thus her voice the conquering train address'd:
‘Hail, happy chiefs! whose steady zeal alone
‘Has sav'd from ruin Fashion's tottering throne,
‘Whose arms have taught my strongest foes to yield,
‘And chas'd resistance from yon sanguine field:
‘For this exploit, your ever-honor'd band,
‘As guards perpetual, round my dome shall stand.
‘And sounding Fame, who at my palace gates,
‘Obedient on my will, for ever waits,
‘Shall with her trumpets teach the echoing wind
‘To bear this happy tale to all mankind,
‘That in each clime where-e'er my awful sway,
‘And high behests, the race of man obey,
‘Your sacred names, to all my sons endear'd,
‘Shall, as my own, be worshipp'd and rever'd. 
‘Sense, Virtue, Wit, and Prudence, all combin'd,
‘No more shall win the reverence of mankind,
‘Courage, and Worth, no longer honor boast,
‘But Glory follow whom you favor most:
‘O'er Beauty, Pam shall reign despotic still,
‘Cupid resign his arrows to Spadille,
‘And all who bow to Fashion's dread awards,
‘Confess the universal power of Cards.


’Joy! Joy! I triumph! Now no more I know

Myself as simply me. I burn with love

Unto myself, and bury me in love.

The centre is within me and its wonder

Lies as a circle everywhere about me.

Joy! Joy! No mortal thought can fathom me.

I am the merchant and the pearl at once.

Lo, Time and Space lie crouching at my feet.

Joy! Joy! When I would reveal in a rapture.

I plunge into myself and all things know. 


Grotesque and queerly huddled
Contortionists to twist
The sleepy soul to a sleep,
We lie all sorts of ways
And cannot sleep.
The wet wind is so cold,
And the lurching men so careless,
That, should you drop to a doze,
Winds' fumble or men's feet
Are on your face. 


Bananas ripe and green, and ginger-root,
Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,
And tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit,
Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs,

Set in the window, bringing memories
Of fruit-trees laden by low-singing rills,
And dewy dawns, and mystical blue skies
In benediction over nun-like hills.

My eyes grew dim, and I could no more gaze;
A wave of longing through my body swept,
And, hungry for the old, familiar ways,
I turned aside and bowed my head and wept. 


Glowing with love, on fire for fame
A Troubadour that hated sorrow
Beneath his lady's window came,
And thus he sung his last good-morrow:
'My arm it is my country's right,
My heart is in my true-love's bower;
Gaily for love and fame to fight
Befits the gallant Troubadour.'

And while he marched with helm on head
And harp in hand, the descant rung,
As faithful to his favourite maid,
The minstrel-burden still he sung:
'My arm it is my country's right,
My heart is in my lady's bower;
Resolved for love and fame to fight
I come, a gallant Troubadour.'

Even when the battle-roar was deep,
With dauntless heart he hewed his way,
'Mid splintering lance and falchion-sweep,
And still was heard his warrior-lay:
'My life it is my country's right,
My heart is in my lady's bower;
For love to die, for fame to fight,
Becomes the valiant Troubadour.'

Alas! upon the bloody field
He fell beneath the foeman's glaive,
But still reclining on his shield,
Expiring sung the exulting stave:-
'My life it is my country's right,
My heart is in my lady's bower;
For love and fame to fall in fight
Becomes the valiant Troubadour.


'Love is cheap, give it away like candy
Because you see, nowadays it's all backwards
It's the people you don't shower with love
That are really, truly important



'The trouble with snowmen,'
Said my father one year
'They are no sooner made
than they just disappear.

I'll build you a snowman
And I'll build it to last
Add sand and cement
And then have it cast.

And so every winter,'
He went on to explain
'You shall have a snowman
Be it sunshine or rain.'

And that snowman still stands
Though my father is gone
Out there in the garden
Like an unmarked gravestone.

Staring up at the house
Gross and misshapen
As if waiting for something
Bad to happen.

For as the years pass
And I grow older
When summers seem short
And winters colder.

The snowmen I envy
As I watch children play
Are the ones that are made
And then fade away. 



Naughty little speckled trout, 
Can't I coax you to come out? 
Is it such great fun to play 
In the water every day? 

Do you pull the Naiads' hair 
Hiding in the lilies there? 
Do you hunt for fishes' eggs, 
Or watch tadpoles grow their legs? 

Do the little trouts have school 
In some deep sun-glinted pool, 
And in recess play at tag 
Round that bed of purple flag? 

I have tried so hard to catch you, 
Hours and hours I've sat to watch you; 
But you never will come out, 
Naughty little speckled trout


Jeremiah Dickson was a true-blue American, 
For he was a little boy who understood America, for he felt that he must 
Think about everything; because that’s all there is to think about, 
Knowing immediately the intimacy of truth and comedy, 
Knowing intuitively how a sense of humor was a necessity 
For one and for all who live in America. Thus, natively, and 
Naturally when on an April Sunday in an ice cream parlor Jeremiah 
Was requested to choose between a chocolate sundae and a banana split 
He answered unhesitatingly, having no need to think of it 
Being a true-blue American, determined to continue as he began: 
Rejecting the either-or of Kierkegaard, and many another European; 
Refusing to accept alternatives, refusing to believe the choice of between; 
Rejecting selection; denying dilemma; electing absolute affirmation: knowing 
in his breast 
The infinite and the gold 
Of the endless frontier, the deathless West. 



"Both: I will have them both!" declared this true-blue American 
In Cambridge, Massachusetts, on an April Sunday, instructed 
By the great department stores, by the Five-and-Ten, 
Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon, 
Tutored by the grandeur, vulgarity, and infinite appetite gratified and 
Shining in the darkness, of the light 
On Saturdays at the double bills of the moon pictures, 
The consummation of the advertisements of the imagination of the light 
Which is as it was—the infinite belief in infinite hope—of Columbus, 
Barnum, Edison, and Jeremiah Dickson. 



So stick up ivy and the bays,
And then restore the heathen ways.
Green will remind you of the spring,
Though this great day denies the thing.
And mortifies the earth and all
But your wild revels, and loose hall.
Could you wear flowers, and roses strow
Blushing upon your breasts' warm snow,
That very dress your lightness will
The brightness of this day we owe
Not unto music, masque, nor show:
Nor gallant furniture, nor plate;
But to the manger's mean estate.
His life while here, as well as birth,
Was but a check to pomp and mirth;
And all man's greatness you may see
Condemned by His humility.
Then leave your open house and noise,
To welcome Him with holy joys,
And the poor shepherd's watchfulness:
Whom light and hymns from heaven did bless.
What you abound with, cast abroad
To those that want, and ease your load.
Who empties thus, will bring more in;
But riot is both loss and sin.
Dress finely what comes not in sight,


"Wolf!" cried my cunning heart
At every sheep it spied,
And roused the countryside.

"Wolf! Wolf!"—and up would start
Good neighbours, bringing spade
And pitchfork to my aid.

At length my cry was known:
Therein lay my release.
I met the wolf alone
And was devoured in peace. 



The essence of a person is being themselves. 
Accepting what they possess in life.
Not being envious of others.
Consuming what is needed, and no more. 
Realising that they are unique in body, and mind.
Are here for the duration of a life short, or long.
Being true in mind, and spirit. 
Traversing all roads in life not avoiding strife.
Facing problems in the best manner possible.
Being evenhanded with all.
Reaching for the stars to be the best you can be.
Helping others in need.
Assisting the environment, and creatures large and small.
Loving with a heart that shines for all to see.
And, respect all. 



FOR knighthood is not in the feats of warre, 
As for to fight in quarrel right or wrong, 
But in a cause which truth can not defarre: 
   He ought himself for to make sure and strong, 
   Justice to keep mixt with mercy among: 
   And no quarrell a knight ought to take 
   But for a truth, or for the common's sake. 

Thou knowest all; I seek in vain
What lands to till or sow with seed -
The land is black with briar and weed,
Nor cares for falling tears or rain.

Thou knowest all; I sit and wait
With blinded eyes and hands that fail,
Till the last lifting of the veil
And the first opening of the gate.

Thou knowest all; I cannot see.
I trust I shall not live in vain,
I know that we shall meet again
In some divine eternity. 

A friend fell and smashed up his teeth and jaw, 
And ended up in 'casualty' what's more, 
The surgeon came to sew up his damaged face, 
And put his teeth and jaw back into place.
He asked the surgeon, if he would be able to play the trumpet, 
No problem at all, the surgeon said, superbly, that I can bet.
Oh, how amazing, said my friend, Gosh, I must tell my wife, 
Because, I've never ever played a trumpet, in my life. 



There's are some stories we will all die with 

There's are also those stories we all die to tell 

Here is one 

The truth about wars and death, 

Of pain and sorrow are hidden deep in the heart of men

The dead man's face.  

The truth he knows he can't share no more

He is forever gone with it 

Death comes to all

But for some to death the truth they take with

'Why do we hide the truth'? 

Why is the easiest thing to ask

The hardest thing to know is the truth! 

Pain and horror cast a shadows on the truth

Sometimes, shame and grief blots out urge to tell the truth

The past is painful.  

So like a safe deposit box, the truth is stored away

So the whole world in a lie because all the truth will never be told 

Forgive me I die, the truth I take away with me

Follow me home, the truth goes along with you

A vicious cycle this that we die with the truth but no one knows

Shameful and deceitful, in a life of lies we live in 

Reach out to tell the truth 

Hold out a candle 

The candles glow stronger the more we light up 

The truth we tell the brighter the world is 

Darkness covers the earth

The secret lies are a blanket over the face of the earth 

In the hearts of men a glimmer of hope if one man the truth is told 

Peace. 

The truth we tell fills the balloon and it blows up big

Let it out, let peace be, fill the balloons up, let love live 

Peace 

The truth is peace


The truth is that I never got over you, 
The trust was I really cared for you, 
As if I were a bird to be free from this harmful world that had upon on us, 
The truth is I never wanted to lose you, 
I never wanted this love to be burn down, 
You had hurt me enough, 
My feelings for you have been crushed, 
I been down, 
I been crushed, 
I been there for you, 
The truth was you reminded me of how much I dated you for all the wrong  reasons, 
All I know was my feelings for you will never change. 

Next to you there's a girl
Sitting way too close but with some kind of distance between you
That only I can see
Your half-hearted smile seems aware of
How ironic this scene is
And her hand on her knees where yours should be looks out of place
And what such is the place of a skipped love? 
Not knowing that she
Is filling the space of something that never began
Waiting to be revived because the lack of an ending
Requires it to live
Forever in your heart that can't let go
The vision of something it longed for
The memory of what could have been
Before your mind decided
To fill in the blank with a blaze that is
Going to burn out while the flame of true love
Is blinding you with its eternal brightness
The momentary light not standing a chance to
A wildfire
Finding its way to your soul
Encircling your thoughts
Making you stand up, turn your head and
Tell the truth


The truth 
However truthful
It may seem
Is after all a point of view




HE'D BEEN there
he likes it
he will be coming over
to stay quite longer
he loves every nook
of it
he has memories there
and will always wish
to be there
he knows he will die there
and it will be a great shame
not only for
him but for his family 
as well
he is set to be there again
come June
till July
despite the storms
or whatever
he loves the place and will
always be loving it

same dirty place
for such a clean man
that he is known to be

same lust
same desire
same shame
but this is it
the truth.  

So the truth finally comes out

You finally see through all his games
And all his lies

You finally realize
That the only place he was every perfect
Was in your eyes

In that moment you realize
That every moment you shared meant nothing at all

And you've never felt like such an idiot
Or so incredibly small

And you realize
That you'd rather stay lying on the ground
Then get back up after taking that long, miserable fall

As your friends draw close to you
Even though you feel the pain start to set in
You fake a smile and say: 
'I'm just glad I know the truth about him'

But when the lights go out
And your left alone
And down your cheeks slowly start to fall tears

The pain in your heart
Turns into a burning fire
That does nothing but sear

That's when you realize
That the hadest thing to do
Is accept what you know to be true

Because sometimes
Nothing hurts more
Than the truth


The truth is I love you, 
I love the way you make me smile, 
I love the way you make me feel, 
The truth is I want to be with you till end of time, 
Baby your the one for me, 
You came into my world and took time to notice me, 
You came up to me and talked to me, 
Through out my life, 
I wondered where you been, 
How you been, 
Now that you are with me I am happy, 
You make me complete, 
You took your time to get to know the real me, 
You were there to listen to my problems, 
Now that your mine, 
I might never want to loose you, 
I hope your the right guy for me, 
I will admit that I LOVE YOU! 
Always have and always will be. . 

the truth is that. 

Do I or in me, 
A selfish beast born? 

butchering the bond-
Beauty of unitedness-the closeness-

Touch of your tender finger, 
Did never in me the divinity awaken? 

Looked back to hold over you.
Hidden! 

Far and far, 
Farther than the stars; 
Searched you, 
I in each star.

Shattered before the eyes, 
Mercilessly-

Castles of  woven dreams, 
Storms of unseen devil; 
Dwelling daringly ever, 
Happily-

Away blown; 
Like the wind.
And I-
Closing my eyes, 

Moved ahead-
Just to live; Just waiting.
Sin-
Sinner nor am I.

Truth-Not yet borne, 
Why you had to be the first to be borne-

To drink the nectar of; 
Unmotherly birth


Woman's faith, and woman's trust -
Write the characters in the dust;
Stamp them on the running stream,
Print them on the moon's pale beam,
And each evanescent letter
Shall be clearer, firmer, better,
And more permanent, I ween,
Than the thing those letters mean.

I have strain'd the spider's thread
'Gainst the promise of a maid;
I have weigh'd a grain of sand
'Gainst her plight of heart and hand;
I told my true love of the token,
How her faith proved light, and her word was broken:
Again her word and truth she plight,
And I believed them again ere night. 


Gone, I say and walk from church, 
refusing the stiff procession to the grave, 
letting the dead ride alone in the hearse.
It is June.  I am tired of being brave.

We drive to the Cape.  I cultivate
myself where the sun gutters from the sky, 
where the sea swings in like an iron gate
and we touch.  In another country people die.

My darling, the wind falls in like stones
from the whitehearted water and when we touch
we enter touch entirely.  No one's alone.
Men kill for this, or for as much.

And what of the dead?  They lie without shoes
in the stone boats.  They are more like stone
than the sea would be if it stopped.  They refuse
to be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone. 

As I sit here today filled with all the lies flowing my way
I realize one thing that always was true
And as I forgive others who may have offended me
In The Truth and will not compromise, and those who have, because of fear
Of the loss of loved ones, He will protect them now by and as His Wisdom
Will cause The Truth to flow everywhere at this time
Amen. 



Silent I'm biding,
While softly gliding
Sink the still hours to eternity's sleep.
My fancies roaming
List in the gloaming:-
Will she the trysting now keep?

Winter is dreaming,
Bright stars are beaming,
Smiling their light through its cloud-veil they pour,
Summer foretelling
Sweet love compelling;-
Dare she not meet me here more?

'Neath the ice lying,
Longing and sighing,
Ocean would wander and warmer lands woo.
Anchored ships swinging,
Sail-thoughts outflinging;-
Come we together, we two!

Whirling and fallings
Pictures enthralling,
Fairy-light made in the forest the snow;
Wood-folk are straying,
Shadows are playing;-
Was it your footstep? Oh, no!

Courage is failing,
Hoar frost assailing
Boughs of your longing surrounds with its spell.
But I dare enter,
Break to the center,
Where in dream-fetters you dwell. 




I went to turn the grass once after one 
Who mowed it in the dew before the sun. 

The dew was gone that made his blade so keen 
Before I came to view the levelled scene. 

I looked for him behind an isle of trees; 
I listened for his whetstone on the breeze. 

But he had gone his way, the grass all mown, 
And I must be, as he had been,—alone, 

'As all must be,' I said within my heart, 
'Whether they work together or apart.' 

But as I said it, swift there passed me by 
On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly, 

Seeking with memories grown dim over night 
Some resting flower of yesterday's delight. 

And once I marked his flight go round and round, 
As where some flower lay withering on the ground. 

And then he flew as far as eye could see, 
And then on tremulous wing came back to me. 

I thought of questions that have no reply, 
And would have turned to toss the grass to dry; 

But he turned first, and led my eye to look 
At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook, 

A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared 
Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared. 

I left my place to know them by their name, 
Finding them butterfly-weed when I came. 

The mower in the dew had loved them thus, 
By leaving them to flourish, not for us, 

Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him, 
But from sheer morning gladness at the brim. 

The butterfly and I had lit upon, 
Nevertheless, a message from the dawn, 

That made me hear the wakening birds around, 
And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground, 

And feel a spirit kindred to my own; 
So that henceforth I worked no more alone; 

But glad with him, I worked as with his aid, 
And weary, sought at noon with him the shade; 

And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech 
With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach. 


'Men work together,' I told him from the heart, 
'Whether they work together or apart.

'Tossing turban style contours, with an aloofness as one passes by, 
Utilizing every charm it possesses, under a lupin blue cloudless sky, 
Like a guardsman, gallantly standing, holding up his noble head high, 
In rainbow colours, brilliant and stately, a vision to surely yield a sigh, 
Ponder thus upon the regal tulip, it has pure beauty, you cannot deny. 

Unknown faces in the street 
And winter coming on. I 
Stand in the last moments of 
The city, no more a child, 
Only a man, -- one who has 
Looked upon his own nakedness 
Without shame, and in defeat 
Has seen nothing to bless. 
Touched once, like a plum, I turned 
Rotten in the meat, or like 
The plum blossom I never 
Saw, hard at the edges, burned 
At the first entrance of life, 
And so endured, unreckoned, 
Untaken, with nothing to give. 
Denied him; I am alive. 

The turtle lives 'twixt plated decks
Which practically conceal its sex. 
I think it clever of the turtle 
In such a fix to be so fertile. 


-O you bitter bitterness, 
boring boredom, 
deadly boredom. 

This is how I will 
spend my time. 

This is how I will 
scratch my head, 

munch on seeds, 
some sunflower seeds, 

play with my knife 
play with my knife. 

You bourgeosie, fly as a sparrow! 
I'll drink your blood, 

your warm blood, for love, 
for dark-eyed love. 

                rest in peace. 

Such boredom! 


XII 
.  On they march with sovereign tread.  
‘Who else goes there? Come out! I said 
come out!’ It is the wind and the red 
flag plunging gaily at their head. 

The frozen snow-drift looms in front. 
‘Who’s in the drift! Come out! Come here!’ 
There’s only the homeless mongrel runt 
limping wretchedly in the rear


‘You mangy beast, out of the way 
before you taste my bayonet. 
Old mongrel world, clear off I say! 
I’ll have your hide to sole my boot! 

The shivering cur, the mongrel cur 
bares his teeth like a hungry wolf, 
droops his tail, but does not stir

‘Hey answer, you there, show yourself.’ 

‘Who’s that waving the red flag?’ 
‘Try and see! It’s as dark as the tomb!’ 
‘Who’s that moving at a jog 
trot, keeping to the back-street gloom?’ 

‘Don’t you worry ~ I’ll catch you yet; 
better surrender to me alive!’ 
‘Come out, comrade, or you’ll regret 
it ~ we’ll fire when I’ve counted five!’ 

Crack ~ crack ~ crack! But only the echo 
answers from among the eaves

The blizzard splits his seams, the snow 
laughs wildly up the wirlwind’s sleeve


Crack ~ crack ~ crack! 
Crack ~ crack ~ crack! 
.  So they march with sovereign tread

Behind them limps the hungry dog, 
and wrapped in wild snow at their head 
carrying a blood-red flag ~ 
soft-footed where the blizzard swirls, 
invulnerable where bullets crossed ~ 
crowned with a crown of snowflake pearls, 
a flowery diadem of frost, 

If you danced from midnight
to six A. 




M. who would understand?

The runaway boy
who chucks it all
to live on the Boston Common
on speed and saltines,
pissing in the duck pond,
rapping with the street priest,
trading talk like blows,
another missing person,
would understand.

The paralytic's wife
who takes her love to town,
sitting on the bar stool,
downing stingers and peanuts,
singing 'That ole Ace down in the hole,'
would understand.

The passengers
from Boston to Paris
watching the movie with dawn
coming up like statues of honey,
having partaken of champagne and steak
while the world turned like a toy globe,
those murderers of the nightgown
would understand.

The amnesiac
who tunes into a new neighborhood,
having misplaced the past,
having thrown out someone else's
credit cards and monogrammed watch,
would understand.

The drunken poet
(a genius by daylight)
who places long-distance calls
at three A. 

M. and then lets you sit
holding the phone while he vomits
(he calls it 'The Night of the Long Knives')
getting his kicks out of the death call,
would understand.

The insomniac
listening to his heart
thumping like a June bug,
listening on his transistor
to Long John Nebel arguing from New York,
lying on his bed like a stone table,
would understand.

The night nurse
with her eyes slit like Venetian blinds,
listening to the heart monitor,
the death cricket bleeping,
she who calls you 'we'
and keeps vigil like a ballistic missile,
would understand.




Once
this king had twelve daughters,
each more beautiful than the other.
They slept together, bed by bed
in a kind of girls' dormitory.
At night the king locked and bolted the door
. How could they possibly escape?
Yet each morning their shoes
were danced to pieces.
Each was as worn as an old jockstrap.
The king sent out a proclamation
that anyone who could discover
where the princesses did their dancing
could take his pick of the litter.
However there was a catch.
If he failed, he would pay with his life.
Well, so it goes.

Many princes tried,
each sitting outside the dormitory,
the door ajar so he could observe
what enchantment came over the shoes.
But each time the twelve dancing princesses
gave the snoopy man a Mickey Finn
and so he was beheaded.
Poof! Like a basketball.

It so happened that a poor soldier
heard about these strange goings on
and decided to give it a try.
On his way to the castle
he met an old old woman.
Age, for a change, was of some use.
She wasn't stuffed in a nursing home.
She told him not to drink a drop of wine
and gave him a cloak that would make
him invisible when the right time came.
And thus he sat outside the dorm.
The oldest princess brought him some wine
but he fastened a sponge beneath his chin,
looking the opposite of Andy Gump.
The sponge soaked up the wine,
and thus he stayed awake.
He feigned sleep however
and the princesses sprang out of their beds
and fussed around like a Miss America Contest.
Then the eldest went to her bed
and knocked upon it and it sank into the earth.
They descended down the opening
one after the other. They crafty soldier
put on his invisible cloak and followed.
Yikes, said the youngest daughter,
something just stepped on my dress.
But the oldest thought it just a nail.

Next stood an avenue of trees,
each leaf make of sterling silver.
The soldier took a leaf for proof.
The youngest heard the branch break
and said, Oof! Who goes there?
But the oldest said, Those are
the royal trumpets playing triumphantly.
The next trees were made of diamonds.
He took one that flickered like Tinkerbell
and the youngest said: Wait up! He is here!
But the oldest said: Trumpets, my dear.

Next they came to a lake where lay
twelve boats with twelve enchanted princes
waiting to row them to the underground castle.
The soldier sat in the youngest's boat
and the boat was as heavy as if an icebox
had been added but the prince did not suspect.

Next came the ball where the shoes did duty.
The princesses danced like taxi girls at Roseland
as if those tickets would run right out.
They were painted in kisses with their secret hair
and though the soldier drank from their cups
they drank down their youth with nary a thought.

Cruets of champagne and cups full of rubies.
They danced until morning and the sun came up
naked and angry and so they returned
by the same strange route. The soldier
went forward through the dormitory and into
his waiting chair to feign his druggy sleep.
That morning the soldier, his eyes fiery
like blood in a wound, his purpose brutal
as if facing a battle, hurried with his answer
as if to the Sphinx. The shoes! The shoes!
The soldier told. He brought forth
the silver leaf, the diamond the size of a plum.

He had won. The dancing shoes would dance
no more. The princesses were torn from
their night life like a baby from its pacifier.
Because he was old he picked the eldest.
At the wedding the princesses averted their eyes
and sagged like old sweatshirts.
Now the runaways would run no more and never
again would their hair be tangled into diamonds,
never again their shoes worn down to a laugh,
never the bed falling down into purgatory
to let them climb in after
with their Lucifer kicking. 

When he gets off work at Packard, they meet
outside a diner on Grand Boulevard. He's tired,
a bit depressed, and smelling the exhaustion
on his own breath, he kisses her carefully
on her left cheek. Early April, and the weather
has not decided if this is spring, winter, or what.
The two gaze upwards at the sky which gives
nothing away: the low clouds break here and there
and let in tiny slices of a pure blue heaven.
The day is like us, she thinks; it hasn't decided 
what to become. The traffic light at Linwood
goes from red to green and the trucks start up,
so that when he says, 'Would you like to eat?'
she hears a jumble of words that mean nothing,
though spiced with things she cannot believe,
'wooden Jew' and 'lucky meat.' He's been up 
late, she thinks, he's tired of the job, perhaps tired
of their morning meetings, but when he bows
from the waist and holds the door open
for her to enter the diner, and the thick 
odor of bacon frying and new potatoes
greets them both, and taking heart she enters
to peer through the thick cloud of tobacco smoke
to the see if 'their booth' is available.
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that there were no
second acts in America, but he knew neither
this man nor this woman and no one else
like them unless he stayed late at the office
to test his famous one liner, 'We keep you clean
Muscatine,' on the woman emptying
his waste basket. Fitzgerald never wrote 
with someone present, except for this woman
in a gray uniform whose comings and goings
went unnoticed even on those December evenings
she worked late while the snow fell silently
on the window sills and the new fluorescent lights
blinked on and off. Get back to the two, you say.
Not who ordered poached eggs, who ordered 
only toast and coffee, who shared the bacon
with the other, but what became of the two
when this poem ended, whose arms held whom,
who first said 'I love you' and truly meant it,
and who misunderstood the words, so longed
for, and yet still so unexpected, and began
suddenly to scream and curse until the waitress
asked them both to leave. The Packard plant closed
years before I left Detroit, the diner was burned
to the ground in ' two years before my oldest son
fled to Sweden to escape the American dream.
'And the lovers?' you ask. I wrote nothing about lovers.
Take a look. Clouds, trucks, traffic lights, a diner, work,
a wooden shoe, East Moline, poached eggs, the perfume
of frying bacon, the chaos of language, the spices
of spent breath after eight hours of night work.
Can you hear all I feared and never dared to write?
Why the two are more real than either you or me,
why I never returned to keep them in my life,
how little I now mean to myself or anyone else,
what any of this could mean, where you found
the patience to endure these truths and confessions

Part I
Heavy hangs the raindrop 
From the burdened spray; 
Heavy broods the damp mist 
On Uplands far away;

Heavy looms the dull sky,
Heavy rolls the sea -
And heavy beats the young heart 
Beneath that lonely Tree -

Never has a blue streak 
Cleft the clouds since morn -
Never has his grim Fate 
Smiled since he was born -

Frowning on the infant, 
Shadowing childhood's joy; 
Guardian angel knows not 
That melancholy boy.

Day is passing swiftly 
Its sad and sombre prime;
Youth is fast invading 
Sterner manhood's time -

All the flowers are praying 
For sun before they close, 
And he prays too, unknowing,
That sunless human rose!

Blossoms, that the westwind 
Has never wooed to blow,
Scentless are your petals,
Your dew as cold as snow -

Soul, where kindred kindness 
No early promise woke,
Barren is your beauty 
As weed upon the rock -

Wither, Brothers, wither,
You were vainly given -
Earth reserves no blessing 
For the unblessed of Heaven!

Part II

Child of Delight! with sunbright hair 
And seablue, sea-deep eyes; 
Spirit of Bliss, what brings thee here, 
Beneath these sullen skies?

Thou shouldest live in eternal spring, 
Where endless day is never dim; 
Why, seraph, has thy erring wing 
Borne thee down to weep with him?

'Ah, not from heaven am I descended,
And I do not come to mingle tears;
But sweet is day though with shadows blended;
And, though clouded, sweet are youthful years -

I, the image of light and gladness, 
Saw and pitied that mournful boy;
And I swore to take his gloomy sadness, 
And give to him my beamy joy -

'Heavy and dark the night is closing;
Heavy and dark may its biding be;
Better for all from grief reposing,
And better for all who watch like me -

'Guardian angel, he lacks no longer; 
Evil fortune he need not fear; 
Fate is strong–but Love is stronger, 
And more unsleeping than angel's care.


 



'Twas my last waking thought, how it could be,
That thou, sweet friend, such anguish should'st endure
When straight from Dreamland came a dwarf, and he
Could tell the cause, forsooth, and knew the cure.

Methought he fronted me with peering look
Fixed on my heart; and read aloud in game
The loves and griefs therein, as from a book;
And uttered praise like one who wished to blame.

In every heart (quoth he) since Adam's sin
Two Founts there are, of Suffering and of Cheer!
That to let forth, and this to keep within!
But she, whose aspect I find imaged here,

Of Pleasure only will to all dispense,
That Fount alone unlock, by no distress
Choked or turned inward; but still issue thence
Unconquered cheer, persistent loveliness.

As on the driving cloud the shiny Bow,
That gracious thing made up of tears and light,
Mid the wild rack and rain that slants below
Stands smiling forth, unmoved and freshly bright:

As though the spirits of all lovely flowers,
In weaving each its wreath and dewy crown,
Or e'er they sank to earth in vernal showers,
Had built a bridge to tempt the angels down.

Ev'n so, Eliza! on that face of thine,
On that benignant face, whose look alone
(The soul's translucence through her crystal shrine!)
Has power to soothe all anguish but thine own.

A beauty hovers still, and ne'er takes wing,
But with a silent charm compels the stern
And tort'ring Genius of the Bitter Spring,
To shrink aback, and cower upon his urn.

Who then needs wonder, if (no outlet found
In passion, spleen, or strife,) the Fount Of Pain
O'erflowing beats against its lovely mound,
And in wild flashes shoots from heart to brain?

Sleep, and the Dwarf with that unsteady gleam
On his raised lip, that aped a critic smile,
Had passed: yet I, my sad thoughts to beguile,
Lay weaving on the tissue of my dream:

Till audibly at length I cried, as though
Thou hadst indeed been present to my eyes,
O sweet, sweet sufferer! if the case be so,
I pray thee, be less good, less sweet, less wise!

In every look a barbed arrow send,
On those soft lips let scorn and anger live!
Do any thing, rather than thus, sweet friend!
Hoard for thyself the pain, thou wilt not give



Two genii are there, from thy birth through weary life to guide thee;
Ah, happy when, united both, they stand to aid beside thee?
With gleesome play to cheer the path, the one comes blithe with beauty,
And lighter, leaning on her arm, the destiny and duty.
With jest and sweet discourse she goes unto the rock sublime,
Where halts above the eternal sea the shuddering child of time.
The other here, resolved and mute and solemn, claspeth thee,
And bears thee in her giant arms across the fearful sea.
Never admit the one alone!--Give not the gentle guide
Thy honor--nor unto the stern thy happiness confide

Two old Bachelors were living in one house;
One caught a Muffin, the other caught a Mouse.
Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse,--
'This happens just in time! For we've nothing in the house,
'Save a tiny slice of lemon nd a teaspoonful of honey,
'And what to do for dinner -- since we haven't any money?
'And what can we expect if we haven't any dinner,
'But to loose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?'

Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin,--
'We might cook this little Mouse, if we had only some Stuffin'!
'If we had but Sage and


Onion we could do extremely well,
'But how to get that Stuffin' it is difficult to tell'--

Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town
And asked for Sage and Onions as they wandered up and down;
They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found
In the Shops, or in the Market, or in all the Gardens round.

But some one said, -- 'A hill there is, a little to the north,
'And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;--
'And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage,--
'An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.
'Climb up, and seize him by the toes! -- all studious as he sits,--
'And pull him down, -- and chop him into endless little bits!
'Then mix him with your Onion, (cut up likewise into Scraps,)--
'When your Stuffin' will be ready -- and very good: perhaps.'

Those two old Bachelors without loss of time
The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;
And at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook,
They saw that Sage, a reading of a most enormous book.

'You earnest Sage!' aloud they cried, 'your book you've read enough in!--
'We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin'!'--

But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book,
At those two Bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took;--
and over crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,--
At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town,--
And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want
of Stuffin',)
The Mouse had fled; -- and, previously, had eaten up the Muffin.

They left their home in silence by the once convivial door.
And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more. 

Two are the pathways by which mankind can to virtue mount upward;
      If thou should find the one barred, open the other will lie.
    'Tis by exertion the happy obtain her, the suffering by patience.
      Blest is the man whose kind fate guides him along upon both




I heard an Angel Singing
When the day was springing:
"Mercy, pity, and peace,
Are the world's release


So he sang all day
Over the new-mown hay,
Till the sun went down,
And the haycocks looked brown.

I heard a devil curse
Over the heath and the furse:
"Mercy vould be no more
If there were nobody poor,
And pity no more could be
If all were happy as ye:
And mutual fear brings peace,
Misery's increase
Are mercy, pity, and peace


At his curse the sun went down,
And the heavens gave a frown. 

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright, 
In the forests of the night, 
What immortal hand or eye 
Could frame thy fearful symmetry? 

In what distant deeps or skies 
Burnt the fire of thine eyes? 
On what wings dare he aspire? 
What the hand dare sieze the fire? 

And what shoulder, & what art, 
Could twist the sinews of thy heart? 
And when thy heart began to beat, 
What dread hand? & what dread feet? 

What the hammer? what the chain? 
In what furnace was thy brain? 
What the anvil? what dread grasp 
Dare its deadly terrors clasp? 

When the stars threw down their spears, 
And water'd heaven with their tears, 
Did he smile his work to see? 
Did he who made the Lamb make thee? 

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright 
In the forests of the night, 
What immortal hand or eye 
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry

When I see my brother
we like to call each other
ugly just for fun.  Of course, 
he's very handsome.
I'm the ugly one.


He sez, you bin taken them ugly pills again
and I say well, I only took two but you musta taken ten! 
Then I say you look like you bin whupped wit a ugly stick
and he sez I wuz but it din't take, but wit you it did the trick! 
Then he sez when you wuz bein' born they thot you wuz breech, 
and well, after you come out they still couldn't tell! 
Then I say when you wuz born you wuz so ugly 
the doctor done slapped our mama! 
Then he sez is that your face 
or a map of Yokohama? 

Then we both laugh and hug each other
because I really love my brother. 

The swans are so beautiful, they are loved and admired by many, seeing them as they swim to and fro in their pond.
Their features are astounding, they are one of a kind, simply a blessing to the eyes.
O look at how their feathers are white and fluffy, and are filled with zest.
Their beaks are of perfect size, they are nothing but the best.
Their wings are precisely laid down on their body. When they choose to spread them open, it's really worth the while.


But poor duckling on the other hand has no secret admirer.
Duckling is always isolated because she is seen as ugly.
As she tries to swim along the swans all of them dash away.
Her feathers are not so stylish, they're as pale as can be.
Her beak is broad and awful, no one wants to see.
As she attempts to impress the crowd, she never gets any notice.
Always in her own little world raveled and ashamed.
When the beautiful swans come out to play she's never invited.
If she ever swim astray she's never assisted.
Poor ugly duckling could never seem to find her way.
In a pond full of creatures, she's the only one betrayed.
As the swans fly with great leaps to the sky, poor ugly duckling always flies low.
Her wings can only take her as high as her esteem goes.
She has lost her confidence in the swans' dominance.
She hasn't been accustom to royal convenience.
Alone near ashore you'll find the ugly duckling.
Searching for the worms early in the morning.
She's always on time and always punctual.
She never cheats or tries to steal from anyone.
She's an honest duckling! 
The swans will do whatever it takes to get noticed.
They'll even still poor ducklings worms if they so insist.
They never say thank you and they never say good-bye.
Their heart is filled with ugly, ducklings heart is filled with joy.






That helped to pull him out of poverty.
So why do we need ghosts in our lives to appear? 
It doesn’t cost anything for love to share. 

The ocean, 
The ultimate poetess 
Ever writing, ever reading
Reaching to the shores to collect out footprints, 
Deciphering our steps
She feels the rhythm of our moments, 
The meter of our stay
Sand castles have summoned a smile upon her face, 
For the laughter of children has brought her meaning
The solitary ones looking for love, 
She feels their pain as they read their paperbacks, 
Counting their hopes and dreams.
Lovers have walked hand in hand charmed by her presence 
She makes a bed for them at night, 
On the naked dunes
Ghost crabs dart in the shadows, 
As the night comes to a close
The dawn burns a fresh color of blue upon every wave, 
As the silver shines brighter while the sun sharpens it's edge, 
And we are cut by its beauty 

It is at the midnight hour she writes, 
Recalling inspiring moments of the day's meaning 
Carefully placing shells before our feet, 
And it is at their casting
That we read in between the lines
Of the ultimate poetess


How dare you dump me just like that. ? 
before I'd even considered dumping you. 
if I'd know you were the dumping kind
i'd've dumped you first.

BUT **** IT HURTS


In these long days
Of summery heat
Stirring passionate desire, 
I could live like a modern savage
Feasting deliriously on your flesh, 
Wild ceaseless kisses upon your neck, 
Your lipstick mouth deliciously wet, 
Your body spread open naked for me
On a clean white bed sheet, 
Your soft silk-like hands
Finding my manhood, 
Guiding me into lovely warm currents
Of feminine fluid 
Where I can drown intoxicated
Biting your thighs
Until my mouth discovers
The ultimate tenderness. 


So many times I wanted to be raped, 
In a silent whisper, 
Under the dense cover of a stormy night, 
By wild strangers.

My crescent moon, like the bud of a primrose, 
Longed trespassers, 
To have a lippy suck up to the dungeon core, 
A tease to my latent whore .

And when the spring evolved with monsoons' tide, 
I invited riders, 
To be ridden in their clumsy-colossal rides, 
Day and night.

Hankering upon the imaginary portion of what might be, 
I processed my  libido, 
To be torn, dug,  hammered, stirred, and wined, 
On dissection table.

The rubbing  of the juice  of my nature's will, 
By cutting seals, 
Of psychophysical tuned tornado, 
I projected my prime.

So many, som many Tom, Harry, Dick, 
Sick and weak, 
Sparrow, street dogs, he-goat and rabbits, 
Did slip.

And yet, and yet, -the old age did cause, 
Gathered moss, 
On the rolling mind of temporal time, 
I descry. 

When the world dies, 
and your spirit falls, 
what to do with the question that calls.

A bad decision being made, 
her emotions now a mere facade, 
her questions unanwserable.

Her soul crying, 
her tears can never quench, 
the fire forever sighing.

Siblings on opposing sides, 
numb the betrayal of a bad choice.

What to do when you are in the middle? 
To destroy or nurture? 

What to do is the unanwserable question. 



Sometimes I can almost see, around our heads,
Like gnats around a streetlight in summer,
The children we could have,
The glimmer of them.

Sometimes I feel them waiting, dozing 
In some antechamber - servants, half-
Listening for the bell. 

Sometimes I see them lying like love letters
In the Dead Letter Office

And sometimes, like tonight, by some black
Second sight I can feel just one of them
Standing on the edge of a cliff by the sea 
In the dark, stretching its arms out 
Desperately to me. 


Love is a haunting spell 
 it allows imagination to fulfill 
what oft was thought but never dealt.

Love is a puzzling hang, 
-and enchants the arrested being, -
for the realization of the infinite spring.

Love is a psychic-divine, 
Though life fades, 
Love shines.

Love proves a calm lake, 
As devotee meditates on, 
Avatar’s image.

Love means a search for another, 
The buried bigger of our secret sharer, 
More than the equal in abstract mirror



Hes cold-hearted and stoic to a fault-
He oft' appears at ones front door. ! 
Dressed in black for hidden attack. ! 
'Tis evil to his very core; 

He always leaves his calling card. 
Its printed in blood tinged red. ! ! 
Hes the Undertaker with blue-veined wired hands. 
Complete with 'delusions of grandeur' in his head; 

To say that he is cruel or sinister---
Well, honestly that would be speculation---
But you know there are hints of his malice and maddness. 
In words-cleverly buried in sublimation; 

For its told he will curse the ground that you walk on. ! ! ! 
Set spells of his magic deemed ever so black. 
Seems death 'tis his most fervent destination--
Found in the morbitity of much garnered fact; 

The graveyard 'tis his home away from home. ! ! 
Where headstones share many a grotesque tale. 
For hes the Undertaker with the blue-veined wired hands. ! ! ! 
And oft' the very last in the coffins final nail; 

For in the deep maddness of his cerebrum---
Lies a deep-rooted tendency towards 'blood-lust'. ! ! ! 
He is an ego-centric-dangerous psychopathic deviant. 
Spawned 'neath the center of the Earths most hardened crust; 



I have done one braver thing
Than all the Worthies did,
And yet a braver thence doth spring,
Which is, to keep that hid.

It were but madness now t'impart
The skill of specular stone,
When he which can have learn'd the art
To cut it, can find none.

So, if I now should utter this,
Others (because no more
Such stuff to work upon, there is,)
Would love but as before.

But he who loveliness within
Hath found, all outward loathes,
For he who colour loves, and skin,
Loves but their oldest clothes.

If, as I have, you also do
Virtue attir'd in woman see,
And dare love that, and say so too,
And forget the He and She;

And if this love, though placed so,
From profane men you hide,
Which will no faith on this bestow,
Or, if they do, deride:

Then you have done a braver thing
Than all the Worthies did;
And a braver thence will spring,
Which is, to keep that hid. 

The Undone River! 
Swimmers of ravaging roars, 
Bathed their hungry grey, 
As a gang of wolf on a roe, 
In her awakening bower.




Merciless fury hugs her flesh, 
And consumes as snake in coil.

Government has imposed pleasure tax, 
Any one can paddle speed-boat, 
Her candor, life –denying revolt, and belief, 
Are now easy sweeps, as candles of red-light.

Undone is the fleeting of the Himalayan brook, 
Through the green vales and sunny glades, 
A common river she was destined, and so is made, 

But alas! She hears the step of approaching desert, 
The strength of the youth, flies like lark in her heart



She was so wonderful I wondered
If wedding me she had not blundered;
She was so pure, so high above me,
I marvelled how she came to love me:
Or did she? Well, in her own fashion -
Affection, pity, never passion.

I knew I was not worth her love;
Yet oh, how wistfully I strove
To be her equal in some way;
She knew I tried, and I would pray
Some day she'd hold her head in pride,
And stand with praising by my side.

A Weakling, I - she made me strong;
My finest thoughts to her belong;
Through twenty years she mothered me,
And then one day she smothered me
With kisses, saying wild with joy:
"Soon we'll be three - let's hope, a boy"


"Too old to bear a child," they said;
Well, they were right, for both are dead. . . .
Ah no, not dead - she is with me,
And by my side she'll ever be;
Her spirit lingers, half divine:
All good I do is hers, not mine.

To keep her gentleness alive!
Let in my heart her spirit glow,
And by my thoughts for others show
She is not dead: she'll never die
While love for humankind have 




I.

'THERE is a sound the autumn wind doth make 
Howling and moaning, listlessly and low: 
Methinks that to a heart that ought to break 
All the earth's voices seem to murmur so. 
The visions that crost 
Our path in light-- 
The things that we lost 
In the dim dark night-- 
The faces for which we vainly yearn-- 
The voices whose tones will not return-- 
That low sad wailing breeze doth bring 
Borne on its swift and rushing wing. 
Have ye sat alone when that wind was loud, 
And the moon shone dim from the wintry cloud? 
When the fire was quench'd on your lonely hearth, 
And the voices were still which spoke of mirth? 

If such an evening, tho' but one, 
It hath been yours to spend alone-- 
Never,--though years may roll along 
Cheer'd by the merry dance and song; 
Though you mark'd not that bleak wind's sound before, 
When louder perchance it used to roar-- 
Never shall sound of that wintry gale 
Be aught to you but a voice of wail! 
So o'er the careless heart and eye 
The storms of the world go sweeping by; 
But oh! when once we have learn'd to weep, 
Well doth sorrow his stern watch keep. 
Let one of our airy joys decay-- 
Let one of our blossoms fade away-- 
And all the griefs that others share 
Seem ours, as well as theirs, to bear: 
And the sound of wail, like that rushing wind 
Shall bring all our own deep woe to mind! 

'I went through the world, but I paused not now 
At the gladsome heart and the joyous brow: 
I went through the world, and I stay'd to mark 
Where the heart was sore, and the spirit dark: 
And the grief of others, though sad to see, 
Was fraught with a demon's joy to me! 

'I saw the inconstant lover come to take 
Farewell of her he loved in better days, 
And, coldly careless, watch the heart-strings break-- 
Which beat so fondly at his words of praise. 
She was a faded, painted, guilt-bow'd thing, 
Seeking to mock the hues of early spring, 
When misery and years had done their worst 
To wither her away. The big tears burst 
From out her flashing eyes, which turn'd on him 
With agony, reproach, and fear, while dim 
Each object swam in her uncertain sight, 
And nature's glories took the hue of night. 
There was, in spite of all her passion's storm, 
A wild revolting beauty in her form; 
A beauty as of sin, when first she comes 
To tempt us from our calm and pleasant homes. 
Her voice, with the appealing tone it took, 
Her soft clear voice, belied her fearless look: 
And woman's tenderness seem'd still to dwell 
In that full bosom's agonizing swell. 
And he stood there, the worshipp'd one of years-- 
Sick of her fondness--angry at her tears; 
Choking the loathing words which rose within 
The heart whose passion tempted her to sin; 
While with a strange sad smile lost hours she mourns, 
And prays and weeps, and weeps and prays by turns. 

A moment yet he paused, and sigh'd--a sigh 
Of deep, deep bitterness; and on his eye 
Love's gentle shadow rested for a space-- 
And faded feelings brighten'd o'er his face. 
'Twas but a moment, and he turn'd in wrath 
To quench the sunshine on her lonely path. 
And his lip curl'd, as on that alter'd cheek 
His cold glance rested--while, all faint and weak, 
With tearful sad imploring gaze she stood, 
Watching with trembling heart his changeful mood; 
Her thin lips parted with a ghastly smile, 
She strove to please--yet felt she fail'd the while. 
And thus his words burst forth:' And dost thou dare 
Reproach me with the burden of thy care? 
Accuse thy self-will'd heart, where passion reign'd; 
Some other hand the lily might have stain'd, 
For thou didst listen when none else approved, 
Proud in thy strength, and eager to be loved. 
Rose of the morning, how thy leaves are gone! 
How art thou faded since the sunrise shone! 
Think not my presence was the cause of all-- 
Oh no, thy folly would have made thee fall: 
Alike thy woe--alike the cause of blame-- 
Another tempter, but thine act the same. 
And tell me not of all I said or swore: 
Poor wretch! art thou as in the days of yore? 

Thing of the wanton heart and faded brow, 
Whate'er I said or did--I loathe thee now!' 
The frozen tears sank back beneath the lid, 
Whose long black lashes half their sadness hid-- 
And with a calm and stedfast look, which spoke 
Unutterable scorn, her spirit woke:-- 
'And thou art he, for whom my young heart gave 
All hope of pardon on this side the grave! 
For whom I still have struggled on, for years, 
Through days of bitterness and nights of tears!-- 
True, I am changed since that bright summer's day, 
When first from home love lured my steps to stray: 
And true it is that art hath sought to hide 
The work of woe which all my words belied;-- 
But for whose sake have I with watchful care, 
Though sick at heart, endeavour'd to be fair? 
For whom, when daylight broke along the skies, 
Have I with fear survey'd my weeping eyes? 
For whom, with trembling fingers sought to dress 
Each woe-worn feature with mock loveliness? 
Chased the pale sickness from my darken'd brow, 
And strove to listen, calm--as I do now? 
For whom--if not for thee?--Oh! had I been 
Pure as the stainless lily--were each scene 
Of guilt and passion blotted from that book 
Where weepingly and sad the angels look-- 

Did I stand here the calm approved wife, 
Bound to thee by the chain that binds for life-- 
Could I have loved thee more? The dream is past-- 
I who forsook, am lonely at the last! 
One hour ago the thought that we must part, 
And part for ever, would have broke my heart: 
But now--I cast thee from me! Go and seek 
To pale the roses on a fresher cheek. 
Why lingerest thou? Dost fear, when thou art gone, 
My woman's heart will wake, and live alone? 
Fear not--the specious tongue whose well-feign'd tale 
Hath lured the dove to leave her native vale, 
May use its art some other to beguile; 
And the approving world--will only smile. 
But she who sins, and suffers for that sin, 
Who throws the dangerous die, and doth not win-- 
Loves once--and loves no more!' He glided by, 
And she turn'd from him with a shuddering sigh. 

'I saw the widower mournful stand, 
Gazing out on the sea and the land; 
O'er the yellow corn and the waving trees, 
And the blue stream rippling in the breeze. 
Oh! beautiful seem the earth and sky-- 
Why doth he heave that bitter sigh? 

Vain are the sunshine and brightness to him-- 
His heart is heavy, his eyes are dim. 
His thoughts are not with the moaning sea, 
Though his gaze be fix'd on it vacantly: 
His thoughts are far, where the dark boughs wave 
O'er the silent rest of his Mary's grave. 
He starts, and brushes away the tear; 
For the soft small voices are in his ear, 
Of the bright-hair'd angels his Mary left 
To comfort her lonely and long bereft. 
With a gush of sorrow he turns to press 
His little ones close with a fond caress, 
And they sigh--oh! not because Mary sleeps, 
For she is forgotten--but that HE weeps. 
Yes! she is forgotten--the patient love, 
The tenderness of that meek-eyed dove, 
The voice that rose on the evening air 
The joyous tones that greeted them, when 
After a while she came again-- 
The pressure soft of her rose-leaf cheek-- 
The touch of her hand, as white and weak 
She laid it low on each shining head, 
And bless'd the sons of the early dead: 
All is forgotten--all past away 
Like the fading close of a summer's day: 

Or the sound of her voice (though they scarce can tell 
Whose voice it was, that they loved so well) 
Comes with their laughter, a short sweet dream-- 
As the breeze blows over the gentle stream, 
Rippling a moment its quiet breast, 
And leaving it then to its sunny rest. 
But he!--oh! deep in his inmost soul, 
Which hath drunk to the dregs of sorrow's bowl-- 
Her look--and her smile--the lightest word 
Of the musical voice he so often heard, 
And never may hear on earth again, 
Though he love it more than he loved it then-- 
Are buried--to rise at times unbid 
And force hot tears to the burning lid: 
The mother that bore her may learn to forget, 
But he will remember and weep for her yet! 
Oh! while the heart where her head hath lain 
In its hours of joy, in its sighs of pain; 
While the hand which so oft hath been clasp'd in hers 
In the twilight hour, when nothing stirs-- 
Beat with the deep, full pulse of life-- 
Can he forget his gentle wife? 
Many may love him, and he in truth 
May love; but not with the love of his youth: 
Ever amid his joy will come 
A stealing sigh for that long-loved home, 
And her step and her voice will go gliding by 
In the desolate halls of his memory! 

'I saw a father weeping, when the last 
Of all his dear ones from his sight had past-- 
The young lamb, in his solitary fold, 
Who should have buried him, for he was old. 
Silently she had pass'd away from earth, 
Beloved by none but him who gave her birth: 
And now he sat, with haggard look and wild, 
By the lone tomb of his forgotten child:-- 

'None remember thee! thou whose heart 
Pour'd love on all around. 
Thy name no anguish can impart-- 
'Tis a forgotten sound. 
Thine old companions pass me by 
With a cold bright smile, and a vacant eye-- 
And none remember thee 
Save me. 
'None remember thee! thou wert not 
Beauteous as some things are; 
No glory beam'd upon thy lot, 
My pale and quiet star. 
Like a winter bud that too soon hath burst, 
Thy cheek was fading from the first-- 

And none remember thee 
Save me! 
'None remember thee! they could spy 
Nought, when they gazed on thee, 
But thy soul's deep love in thy quiet eye-- 
It hath pass'd from their memory. 
The gifts of genius were not thine 
Proudly before the world to shine-- 
And none remember thee 
Save me! 
'None remember thee! now thou'rt gone, 
Or they could not choose but weep,-- 
When they think of thee, my gentle one, 
In thy long and lonely sleep. 
Fain would I murmur thy name, and tell 
How fondly together we used to dwell-- 
But none remember thee 
Save me!' 

'I saw a husband, and a guilty wife, 
Who once made all the sunshine of his life, 
Kneeling upon the threshold of her home, 
Where heavily her weary feet had come: 
A faded form, a humble brow, are hers-- 
The livery which sinful sorrow wears; 

While with deep agony she lifts her eyes, 
And prays him to forgive her, ere she dies! 
Long days--long days swell in his broken heart, 
When death had seem'd less bitter than to part-- 
When in her innocence her hush'd lip spoke 
The faint confession of the love he woke; 
And the first kiss on that pure cheek impress'd, 
Made her shrink, trembling, from his faithful breast. 
And after years when her light footstep made 
Most precious music--when in sun or shade 
She was the same bright, happy, loving thing-- 
Low at his feet she now lies withering! 
His half-stretch'd hand already bids her be 
Forgiven and at peace--his kindly eye 
Is turn'd on her through tears, to think that she, 
His purely-loved, should bide such agony. 
Already on his tongue the quivering word 
Of comfort trembles, though as yet unheard; 
Already he hath bent o'er that pale face: 
Why starts he, groaning, from her wild embrace? 
Oh! as she clasp'd his knees, her full heart woke 
To all its tenderness--a murmur broke 
Forth from her lip; the cherish'd name of one 
Whose image dwelt when purity was gone, 
Secure amid the ruins of lost things, 
Filling her soul with soft imaginings, 

Like a lone flower within the moss-grown halls 
Where echo vainly unto echo calls. 
Deep wrath, and agony, and vain despair, 
Are painted on his brow who hears her prayer. 
'Breathe not her name--it is a sound 
Of fearfulness and dread. 
Seest thou no trace of tears around? 
Yet have salt tears been shed! 
Thy babe who nestled at thy breast, 
And laugh'd upon thy knee; 
That creature of the quiet rest, 
Thy child--was too like thee! 
The careless fawn that lightly springs-- 
The rosebud in the dew-- 
The fair of nature's fairy things-- 
Like them thy daughter grew. 
And then she left her father's side, 
Not, woman! as a happy bride, 
With a tearful smile, half sad, half meek; 
The flush of guilt was on her cheek: 
And in the desert wilds I sought-- 
And in the haunts of men. 
Woman! what thou hast felt is naught 
To what I suffer'd then. 
I thought that--but it may not be-- 
I thought I could have pardon'd thee; 

But when I dream of her, and think 
Thy steps led on to ruin's brink-- 
Oh she is gone, and thou art here 
Where ye both were of yore-- 
To mock with late-repentant tear 
Hopes which may come no more! 
Hadst thou, frail wretch, been by her still, 
To shield her gentle head from ill-- 
To do thy mother's part--but go-- 
I will not curse thee, in my woe : 
Only, depart!--and haply when 
Lonely and left I die, 
Thy pardon'd form shall rise again 
And claim one parting sigh!' 
He closed on her the portal of her home, 
Where never more her weary feet may come-- 
And their wrung hearts are sever'd till that day 

'I saw the parricide raving stand, 
With a rolling eye, and a bloody hand; 
Through his thick chill veins the curdling stream 
Flows dark and languid. No sunny beam 
Can wake the deep pulse of his heart to joy, 
Since he raised his murderous hand to destroy. 
By day, by night, no pause is given 
Of hope to the soul accursed by Heaven. 
Through the riotous feast; through his own dull groans; 
Through the musical sound of his loved one's tones; 
Through the whispering breath of the evening air, 
Faulters the old man's dying prayer. 
Few were the words he spoke as he sank; 
And the greedy poniard his life-blood drank: 
'Spare me, my son, I will yield thee all.' 
Oh, what would the murderer give to recall 
One murmuring sigh to that silent tongue, 
Which in infancy sought his ear to please; 
One pulse of life, to the hands that clung 
Feebly and tremblingly round his knees! 
In vain! he hath won the gold he sought; 
And the burning agony of thought 
Shall haunt him still, till he lays his head 
With a shuddering groan on his dying bed! 

'I saw a young head bow'd in its deep woe, 
Ev'n unto death; and sad, and faint, and slow, 
As she sat lonely in her hall of tears, 
Her lips address'd some shade of other years: 
'Oh! dear to the eyes that are weeping 
Was thy form, my lost love: 
Though the heart where thine image is sleeping 
Its truth might not prove. 
I have wept and turn'd from thee, for fear thou shouldst trace 
All the love that I bore thee, deep writ on my face. 
But oh! could we once more be meeting, 
As then, love, we met: 
Could I feel that fond heart of thine beating, 
Close, close, to mine yet: 
I would cling to thee, dearest, nor fear thou shouldst guess 
How deeply thy welcome had power to bless, 
Oh! tis not for a day, or an hour, 
I part from thee now, 
To weep and shake off, like a flower, 
The tears from my brow: 
'Tis to sit dreaming idly of days that are gone, 
And start up to remember--that I am alone. 
They say that my heart hath recover'd 
The deep bitter blow; 
That the cloud which for long days hath hover'd, 
Is gone from my brow; 
That my eyes do not weep, and my lips wear a smile; 
It is true --but I do not forget thee the while. 
Oh, they know not, amidst all my gladness, 
Thy shadow is there: 

They feel not the deep thrill of sadness, 
Nor the soul's lone despair. 
They see not the sudden quick pang, when thy name 
Is carelessly utter'd, to praise or to blame! 
If to gaze on each long-treasured token 
Till bitter tears flow, 
And to wonder my heart is not broken 
By the weight of its woe: 
To join in the world's loud and 'wildering din, 
While a passionate feeling is choking within: 
If to yearn, in the arms that once bound thee, 
To lean down my head; 
With the dear ones who used to come round thee, 
Salt tear-drops to shed: 
If to list to the voice that is like thine, in vain; 
And feel its dim echo ring wild through my brain: 
If to dream there were pleasure in meeting 
Those who once were with thee: 
To murmur a sad farewell greeting, 
Then sink on my knee; 
With my straining hands clasp'd to the Heavens in prayer, 
And my choked bosom heaving with grief and despair: 
If to sit and to think of thee only, 
While they laugh round the hearth; 
And feel my full heart grow more lonely 
At the sound of their mirth:-- 
If this be forgetting thee, dear one and good-- 

'I saw the child of parents poor, 
Dreaming with pain of her cottage door; 
Which she left for the splendour which may not cheer-- 
Pomp hath not power to dry one tear. 
The palace--the sunshine--what are they to her 
'Mid the heart's full throb, and the bosom's stir? 
The picture that rises bedimm'd with tears, 
Is an aged woman, bow'd down by years; 
Sitting alone in her evening's close, 
And feebly weeping for many woes. 
Her thin hands are weaving the endless thread, 
Her faded eyes gaze where her daughter fled, 
O'er the moss-grown copse and the wooded hill: 
'Oh! would that I were with my mother still! 
That I were with her who rear'd me up-- 
(And I fill'd to the brim her sorrow's cup)-- 
That I were with her who taught me to pray 
At the morning's dawn and the close of day-- 
That I were with her whose harshest look 
Oh! the depth of my sin I never could see, 
But I feel it now, with the babe on my knee.' 

The high proud gaze of her scornful eye 
Is quench'd with the tears for days gone by; 
And her little one starts from its broken rest, 
Woke by the sobs of that heaving breast. 
She gazes with fear on its undimm'd brow-- 
What are the thoughts that lurk below? 
Perchance, like her own, the day will come 
When its name shall be hush'd in its parent home; 
When the hearts that cherish its lightest tone, 
Shall wish that the sound from earth were gone. 
Perchance it is doom'd to an early grave, 
Or a struggling death on the stormy wave; 
Or the fair little dimpled hand that clings 
So fast in her soft hair's shining rings, 
May be dark with the blood of his fellow-men, 
And the clanking chain hang round it then. 
Haply, forgetting her patient care, 
The young, bright creature slumbering there, 
Shall forsake her--as she hath forsaken them-- 
For a heavy heart and a diadem! 
She clasps it strong with a burning kiss-- 

'I saw a widow, by her cherish'd son, 
Ere all of light, and life, and hope, was gone-- 
When the last dying glance was faintly raised, 
Ere death with withering power the brightness glazed 
Of those deep heavenly eyes: a glance which seem'd 
To ask her, if the world where he had dream'd 
Such dreams of happiness with her, must be 
Forsaken in the spring-tide of his glee: 
If he indeed must die. I saw her take 
His hand, and gaze, as if her heart would break, 
On his pale brow and languid limbs of grace, 
And wipe the death-dew gently from his face. 
I saw her after, when the unconscious clay, 
Deaf to her wild appeals, all mutely lay, 
With brow upturn'd, and parted lips, whose hue 
Was scarce more pale than hers, who met my view. 
She stood, and wept not in her deep despair, 
But press'd her lips upon his shining hair 
With a long bitter kiss, and then with grief-- 
Like hers of old, who pray'd and found relief-- 
But, ah! no prophet came, to raise him up for her! 

'I saw the orphan go forth in dread 
Through the pitiless world, and turn to gaze 
Once more on the dark and narrow bed 
Where sleep the authors of her days. 
Well may she weep them, for never more, 
After she turns from that cottage door, 
Will her young heart beat to a kindly word, 
Such as in early days she heard: 
Or her young eye shine, as she hastens her pace 
To bask in the light of a loved one's face. 
Her lot is cast; 
Her hope is past; 
The careless, the cold, and the cruel may comeBut a word, or a sound, or a look of home-- 
For them she must bow her head, and die! 

'I saw the dark and city-clouded spot, 
Where, by his busy patrons all forgot, 
The young sad poet dreams of better days, 
And gives his genius forth in darken'd rays. 
Chill o'er his soul, gaunt poverty hath thrown 
Her veil of shadows, as he sighs alone; 
And, withering up the springs and streams of youth, 
Left him to feel misfortune's bitter truth, 
And own with deep, impassion'd bitterness, 
Who would describe--must faintly feel, distress. 
Slowly he wanders, with a languid pace, 
To the small window of his hiding-place; 

Pressing with straining force, all vainly now, 
His hot, weak fingers on his throbbing brow; 
And seeking for bright thoughts, which care and pain 
Have driven from his dim and 'wilder'd brain. 
He breathes a moment that unclouded air, 
And gazes on the face of nature there-- 
Longing for fresh wild flowers and verdant fields, 
And all the joys the open sunshine yields: 
Then turning, he doth rest his heavy eye 
Where his torn papers in confusion lie, 
And raves awhile, and seats himself again, 
To toil and strive for thoughts and words, in vain: 
Till he can bid his drooping fancy feel, 
And barter genius, for a scanty meal! 

'I've been where fell disease a war hath waged 
Against young joy,--where pestilence hath raged, 
And beauty hath departed from the earth 
With none to weep her.--I have seen the birth 
Of the lorn infant, greeted but with tears, 
And dim forebodings, and remorseful fears, 
When to the weary one the grave would show 
Less dreadful than a long long life of woe. 
I've been in prisons, where in lone despair, 
The debtor pines, for a little gold, 
His fellow man in iron chains would hold: 
There have I seen the bright inquiring eye 
Fade into dull and listless vacancy; 
There have I seen the meek grow stern and wild; 
And the strong man sit weeping like a child; 
Were fain to Curse their Maker, and depart. 
All have I seen--and I have watch'd apart 
The fruitless struggles of a breaking heart, 
Bruised, crush'd, and wounded by the spoiler's power, 
And left to wither like a trodden flower; 
Till I have learnt with ease each thought to trace 
That flush'd across the fair and fading face, 
And known the source of tears, which day by day 
Weakness hath shed, and pride hath brush'd away. 

'It was in Erin--in the autumn time, 
By the broad Shannon's banks of beauty roaming; 
I saw a scene of mingled woe and crime-- 
Oh! ev'n to my sear'd eyes the tears seem'd coming! 
It was a mother standing gaunt and wild, 
Working her soul to murder her young child, 
Who lay unconscious in its soft repose 
Upon the breast, that heaved with many woes. 
She stood beside the waters, but her eyes 
Were not upon the river, nor the skies, 
Nor on the fading things of earth. Her soul 
Was rapt in bitterness--and evening stole 
Chill o'er her form, while yet with nerveless hand 
She sought to throw her burden from the land. 
'Twas pitiful to see her strive in vain, 
Rise sternly up, then melt to love again; 
With horrible energy, and lip compress'd, 
Hold forth her child--then strain it to her breast 
Convulsively; as if some gentle thought 
Of all its helpless beauty first was brought 
Into her 'wilder'd mind--the soft faint smiles, 
Whose charm the mother of her tears beguiles, 
Which speak not aught of mirth or merriment, 
But of full confidence, and deep content, 
And ignorance of woe:--the murmur'd sounds 
Which were to her a language, rise up now-- 
And, like a torrent bursting from its bounds, 
Swell in her heart, and shoot across her brow. 
Oh! she who plans its death in her despair, 
Hath tended it with fond and watchful care; 
Hath borne it wearily for many a mile, 
Repaid with one fond glance, or gentle smile: 
Hath watch'd through long dark nights with patient love, 
When some light sickness struck her nestling dove; 

And yearn'd to bear its pain, when that meek eye 
Turn'd on her, with appealing agony! 
Look on her now!--that faint and feverish start 
Hath waken'd all the mother in her heart: 
That feeble cry hath thrill'd her very frame :-- 
Was it for murder such a soft heart came? 
She will not do it--Fool! the spirit there 
Is stronger far than love--it is despair! 
Mothers alone may read that mother's woe: 
Her heart may break--but she will strike the blow. 
Once more she pauses; bending o'er its face, 
Calm and unconscious in its timid grace; 
Then murmurs to it by the chilly wave, 
Ere one strong effort dooms it to the grave:-- 



'Thou of the sinless breast! 
Which passion hath not heaved, nor dark remorse 
Swell'd with its full and agonizing curse-- 
Lo! thou art come to rest! 

'Warm is thy guileless heart, 
Whose slight quick pulses soon shall beat no more: 
Hear'st thou the strong trees rock?--the loud winds roar? 
I and my child must part! 

'Deep 'neath the sullen sky, 
And the dark waters which do boil and foam, 
Greedy to take thee to their silent home-- 
My little one must lie! 

'Peace to thy harmless soul! 
There is a heaven where thou mayst dwell in peace; 
Where the dark howling of the waters cease, 
Which o'er thy young head roll. 

'There, in the blue still night, 
Thou'lt watch, where stars are gleaming from the sky, 
O'er the dark spot where thou wert doom'd to die, 
And smile, a cherub bright.' 



'A plash upon the waves--a low 
Half-stifled sob, which seem'd as though 
The choked breath fought against the stream-- 
And all was silent as a dream. 
Then rose the shriek that might not stay, 
Though much that soul had braved; 
And ere its echo died away, 
Her little one was saved. 



Sudden I plunged, and panting caught 
The bright and floating hair, 
Which on the waters lustre brought, 
As if 'twere sunshine there. 
I stood beside that form of want and sin, 
That miserable woman in her tears; 
Who wept, as though she had not cast it in 
To perish with the sorrows of past years. 
She thank'd me with a bitter thankfulness, 
And thus I spoke: 'Oh! woman, if it is 
Sickness and poverty, and lone distress, 
That prompted thee to do a deed like this, 
Take gold, and wander forth, and let me be 
A parent to the child renounced by thee!' 
Greedily did she gaze upon the gold, 
With a wild avarice in her hollow eye; 
And stretch'd her thin damp fingers, clammy cold, 
To seize the glittering ore with ecstasy. 
But when I claim'd the little helpless thing, 
For whose young life that gold had paid the worth; 
Close to the breast where it lay shivering, 
She strain'd it gaspingly, and then burst forth:-- 

'I would have slain it! Fool! 'tis true I would; 
Because I saw it pine, and had no food: 
Because I could not bear its faint frail cry, 
Which told my brain such tales of agony: 
Because its dumb petitioning glances said, 
Am I thy child? and canst not give me bread? 
Because, while faint and droopingly it lay 
Within my failing arms from day to day, 
The tigress rose within my soul--I could 
Have slain a man, and bid it lap his blood! 
My little one!--my uncomplaining child! 
Whose lengthen'd misery drove thy mother wild, 
Did they believe that aught but death could part 
These nestling limbs from her poor tortured heart?-- 
No! had the slimy waters gurgled o'er 
Thy corpse, and wash'd the slippery reed-grown shore, 
Leaving no trace, except in my despair, 
Of what had once disturb'd the stillness there-- 
I could have gazed upon it, and not wept; 
For calmly then my little one had slept. 
No nightly moans would then have wrung my soul; 
No daylight withering bid the tear-drop roll. 
In my dark hours of misery and want, 
The memory of thy pallid face might haunt, 
Not, not to wring my heart with vain regret, 
But to remind what thou hadst suffer'd yet, 
If from life's wretchedness I had not freed 
Thy grateful soul, which thank'd me for the deed. 

I lost thee--but I have thee here again, 
Close to the heart which now can feel no pain. 
Cling to me!--let me feel that velvet cheek-- 
Look at me, with those eyes so dove-like meek! 
Press thy pale lips to mine, and let me be 
Repaid for all I have endured for thee. 
Part from thee!--never! while this arm hath strength 
To hold thee to the bosom where thou liest: 
I need not watch thy struggles as thou diest. 
Part from thee! never--no, my pale sweet flower! 
The wealth of worlds would bribe my heart in vain, 
Though 'twere to give thee up for one short hour-- 
Take back thy gold--I have my babe again! 
Yet give me food, and I will clasp thy knees, 
And night and day will kneel for thee to Heaven; 
Else will a lingering death of slow disease, 
Or famine gaunt, be all that thou hast given. 
And when I die-- then, then be kind'--She ceased: 
Her parted lips were tinged with crimson gore, 
Her faint hand half, and only half, released 
The unconscious form she had been weeping o'er: 
Worn nature could not bear the sudden strife; 
I look'd upon her--but there was no life! 

'That little outcast grew a fairy girl, 
A beautiful, a most beloved one. 
There was a charm in every separate curl 
Whose rings of jet hung glistening in the sun, 
Which warm'd her marble brow. There was a grace 
Peculiar to herself, ev'n from the first: 
Shadows and thoughtfulness you seem'd to trace 
Upon that brow, and then a sudden burst 
Of sunniness and laughter sparkled out, 
And spread their rays of joyfulness about. 
Like the wild music of her native land, 
Which wakes to joy beneath the minstrel's hand, 
Yet at its close gives forth a lingering tone-- 
Sad, as if mourning that its mirth is gone, 
And leaves that note to dwell within your heart, 
When all the sounds of joyfulness depart: 
So in her heart's full chords there seem'd to be 
A strange and wild, but lovely melody: 
Half grief--half gladness--but the sadness still 
Hanging like shadows on a summer rill. 
And when her soul from its deep silence woke, 
And from her lip sweet note of answer broke, 
Memory in vain would seek the smile that play'd 
With her slow words, like one beam in the shade; 
Her sorrow hung upon your heart for years-- 
And all her sweet smiles darken'd into tears. 

I loved her, as a father loves his child: 
For she was dutiful, and fond, and mild, 
As children should be--and she ripen'd on 
Like a young rosebud opening to the sun; 
Till the full light of womanhood was shed, 
Like a soft glory, round about her head. 
In all my wanderings, through good and ill, 
In storm and sunshine, she was with me still: 
Not like a cold sad shadow, forced to glide 
Weary--unloved--unnoticed, by my side: 
But with her whole heart's worship, ever near, 
To love, to smile, to comfort, and to cheer. 
Her gentle soul would fear to hurt a worm; 
Yet danger found her unappall'd and firm: 
Her lip might blanch, but her unalter'd eye 
Said, I am ready for thy sake to die. 
She stood by me and fear'd not, in that place 
When the scared remnant of my wretched race 
Gave England's Richard gifts, to let them be 
All unmolested in their misery: 
And while their jewels sparkled on his hand, 
His traitor lips gave forth the dark command 
Which, midst a drunken nation's loud carouse, 
Sent unexpected death from house to house, 
Bade strong arms strike, where none their force withstood, 
And woman's wail be quench'd in woman's blood. 

She stood by me and fear'd not, when again, 
A bloody death cut short a life of pain; 
When, with red glaring eyes and desperate force, 
Brother laid brother low, a prostrate corse, 
Rather than yield their bodies up to those, 
In word, in act, and in religion--foes. 
She gazed and fainted not, while all around 
They lay like slaughter'd cattle on the ground; 
With the wide gash in each extended throat, 
On Israel's side, ere Israel fell away, 
And in her guilt was made the stranger's prey. 

'And after that, we dwelt in many lands, 
And wander'd through the desert's burning sands; 
Where, strange to say, young Miriam sigh'd to be: 
Where nature lay stretch'd out so silently 
Beneath the glorious sun, and here and there 
The fountains bubbled up, as fresh and fair 
As if the earth were fill'd with them, and none 
In their last agonizing thirst sank down, 
With eyes turn'd sadly to far distant dreams 
Of unseen gushing waters, and cool streams. 

'There is a little island all alone 
In the blue Mediterranean; and we went 
Where never yet a human foot had gone, 
And dwelt there, and young Miriam was content. 
There was a natural fountain, where no ray 
Of light or warmth had ever found its way, 
Thick clustered o'er with flowers; and there she made 
A bower of deep retirement and shade; 
And proud she was, when, rosy with the glow 
Of triumph and exertion, she could show 
Her palace of green leaves,--and watch my eyes 
For the expected glance of pleased surprise. 
Oh! she was beautiful!--if ever earth 
To aught of breathing loveliness gave birth. 

'One evening--one sweet evening, as we stood, 
Silently gazing on the silent flood: 
A sudden thought rose swelling in my heart: 
Ought my sweet Miriam thus to dwell apart 
From human kind? So good, so pure, so bright, 
So form'd to be a fervent heart's delight; 
Was she to waste the power and will to bless 
In ministering to my loneliness? 
And then a moment's glance took in her life-- 
I saw my Miriam a blessed wife; 

I saw her with fair children round her knee, 
I heard their voices in that home of glee, 
And turn'd to gaze on her:--if ever yet, 
Turning with shadowy hope, and vain regret, 
And consciousness of secret guilt or woe, 
Thine eyes have rested on the open brow 
Of sinless childhood--thou hast known what I 
Felt, when my glance met Miriam's cloudless eye. 
Oh! Thought, thou mould where misery is cast-- 
Thou joiner of the present with the past-- 
Eternal torturer! wherefore can we not 
Through all our life be careless of our lot 
As in our early years?--No cares to come 
Threw their vain shadow o'er her bosom's home; 
No bitter sorrow, with its vain recall, 
Poison'd her hope--the present hour was all. 
I gazed on her--and as a slow smile broke 
Of meek affection round her rosy mouth, 
I thought the simple words my heart would choke, 
'Would Miriam weep to leave the sunny south?' 
Silent she stood--then, in a tone scarce heard, 
Faulter'd forth, 'father!' Oh! it wrung, that word; 
And snatching her with haste unto my breast, 
Where in her childhood's hour of sunny rest 
Calmly her innocent head had often slept, 
With a strange sense of misery--I wept. 

'Oh! weary days, oh! weary days, 
Of flattery and empty praise, 
When in the tainted haunts of men 
My Miriam was brought again. 
With vacant gaze and gentle sigh, 
She turned her from them mournfully; 
As if she rather felt, than saw, 
That they were near:--they scarce could draw 
A word of answer from her tongue, 
Where once such merry music rung, 
Save when the island was their theme-- 
And then, as waking from a dream, 
Her soft eye lighted for a while, 
And round her mouth a playful smile 
Stole for a moment, and then fled, 
As if the hope within were dead. 
Where'er I gazed, where'er I went, 
Her earnest look was on me bent 
Stealthily, as she wish'd to trace 
Her term of exile on my face. 
And many sought her hand in vain. 
With pleading voice, and look of pain. 
Weepingly she would turn away 
When I besought her to be gay; 
And resolutely firm, withstood 
The noble and the great of blood; 

Though they woo'd humbly, as they woo 
Who scarcely hope for what they sue. 
Oh! glad was Miriam, when at last 
I deem'd our term of absence past: 
And as her light foot quickly sprang 
From out our bark, 'twas thus she sang:-- 

'The world! the sunny world! I love 
To roam untired, till evening throws 
Sweet shadows through the pleasant grove, 
And bees are murmuring on the rose. 
I love to see the changeful flowers 
Lie blushing in the glowing day-- 
Bend down their heads to 'scape the showers, 
Then shake the chilly drops away. 

'The world! the sunny world! oh bright 
And beautiful indeed thou art-- 
The brilliant day, the dark-blue night, 
Bring joy--but not to every heart. 
No! till, like flowers, those hearts can fling 
Grief's drops from off their folded leaves, 
'Twill only smile in hope's bright spring, 
And darken when the spirit grieves.' 

'She was return'd; but yet she grew not glad; 
Her cheek wore not the freshness which it had. 
The withering of the world, like the wild storm 
Over a tender blossom, left her form 
With traces of the havoc that had been, 
Ev'n in the sunny calm, and placid scene. 
Her brow was darken'd with a gentle cloud; 
Her step was slower, and her laugh less loud; 
And oft her sweet voice faulter'd, though she said 
Nothing in which deep meaning could be read. 
I watch'd her gestures when she saw me not, 
And once--(oh! will that evening be forgot?) 
I stole upon her, when she little thought 
Aught but the moaning wind her whispers caught. 

'She sat within her bower, where the sun 
Linger'd, as loth to think his task was done: 
And languidly she raised her heavy gaze, 
To meet the splendour of his parting rays. 
O'er the smooth cheek which rested on her hand; 
Down the rich curls by evening breezes fann'd; 
Upon the full red lip, and rounded arm, 
The swan-like neck, so snowy, yet so warm-- 
Each charm the rosy light was wandering o'er, 
Brightening what seem'd all-beautiful before. 

I paused a moment, gazing yet unseen 
Beneath the sleeping shadows dark and green; 
And thought, how strange that one so form'd to bless 
Should better love to live in loneliness. 
Pure, but not passionless, was that soft brow 
So warmly gilded by the sunset now; 
And in her glistening eye there shone a tear, 
Like those we shed when dreaming--for some dear 
But lost illusion, which returns awhile 
Our nights to brighten with remember'd smile, 
And yet we feel is lost, though sleep, strong sleep, 
Chains the swoln lid, that fain would wake and weep. 
I sat me down beside her; round the zone 
That clasp'd her slender waist my arm was thrown: 
And the bright ringlets of her shining hair 
My fond hand parted on her forehead fair; 
And thus I spoke, as with a smile and sigh 
She murmur'd forth a welcome timidly: 
'Again within the desert and at rest, 
Say, does my Miriam find herself more blest, 
Than when gay throngs in fond devotion hung 
Upon the sportive accents of her tongue? 
Is all which made the city seem so gay, 
The song, the dance, all dream-like pass'd away? 
The sighs, the vows, the worshipping forgot? 
And art thou happier in this lonely spot? 

Is there no form, all vision-like enshrined 
Deep 'mid the treasures of thy guileless mind? 
And, deaf to every pure and faithful sigh, 
Say, would my desert rose-bud lonely die?' 
High, 'neath the arm which carelessly caress'd, 
Rose the quick beatings of that gentle breast; 
And the slight pulses of her fair young hand, 
Which lay so stirlessly within my own, 
Trembled and stopp'd, and trembled, as I scann'd 
The flushing cheek on which my glance was thrown. 
'She loves,' said I; while selfish bitter grief 
Swell'd in my soul;--'she loves, and I must live 
Alone again, more wretched for the brief 
Bright sunshine which her presence used to give.' 
And then with sadden'd tones, (which, though I strove 
To make them playful, tremulously came) 
I murmur'd:'Yes! he lives, whom thou canst love. 
His name, dear Miriam--whisper me his name.' 
There was a pause, and audibly she drew 
Her heaving breath; and faint and fainter grew 
The hand that lay in mine; and o'er her brow 
Flush'd shadows chased each other to and fro: 
Till like a scorch'd-up flower, with languid grace 
That young head droop'd, but sought no resting-place. 

'Dreams pass'd across my soul--dreams of old days-- 
Of forms which in the quiet grave lay sleeping; 
Of eyes which death had stripp'd of all their rays, 
And weary life had quench'd with bitter weeping: 
Dreams of the days when, human still, my heart 
Refused to feel immortal, and kept clinging 
To transient joys, which came and did depart 
As fresh flowers wither, which young hands are flinging. 
Dreams of the days I loved, and was beloved-- 
When some young heart for me its sighs was giving, 
And fond lips murmur'd forth the vow that proved 
Its truth in death, its tenderness when living: 
And dreaming thus, I sigh'd. Answering, there came 
A deep, low, tremulous sob, which thrill'd my frame. 
A moment, that young form shrunk back abash'd 
At its own feelings; and all vainly dash'd 
The tear aside, which speedily return'd 
To quench the cheek where fleeting blushes burn'd. 
A moment, while I sought her fears to stay, 
The timid girl in silence shrank away-- 
A moment, from my grasp her hand withdrew-- 
A moment, hid her features from my view-- 
Then rising, sank with tears upon my breast, 
Her struggles and her love at once confess'd. 

'Years--sorrow--death--the hopes that leave me lone, 
All I have suffer'd, and must suffer on; 
The love of other bright things which may pass 
In half eclipse, beyond the darken'd glass 
Through which my tearful soul hath learnt to gaze-- 
The fond delusions of all future days:-- 
All that this world can bring, hath not the power 
To blot from memory that delicious hour. 
She, who I thought would leave me desolate-- 
For whom I brooded o'er a future fate; 
She, who had wander'd through each sunny land, 
Yet found no heart that could her love command-- 
She lay within my arms, my own--my own-- 
Unsought, unwoo'd, but oh! too surely won. 

'She was not one of many words and vows, 
And breathings of her love, and eager shows 
Of warm affection;--in her quiet eye, 
Which gazed on all she worshipp'd silently, 
There dwelt deep confidence in what she loved, 
And nothing more--till some slight action proved 
My ceaseless thought of her: then her heart woke, 
And fervent feeling like a sunrise broke 
O'er her illumined face. Her love for me 
Was pure and deep, and hidden as the fount 

Which floweth 'neath our footsteps gushingly, 
And of whose wanderings none may take account; 
And like those waters, when the fountain burst 
To light and sunshine, which lay dark at first, 
Quietly deep, it still kept flowing on-- 
Not the less pure for being look'd upon. 

'And then she loved all things, and all loved her. 
Each sound that mingleth in the busy stir 
Of nature, was to her young bosom rife 
With the intelligence of human life. 
Edith, my playful Edith, when her heart 
Tenderly woke to do its woman's part, 
Fill'd with a sentiment so strong and new, 
Each childish passion from her mind withdrew, 
And looking round upon the world beheld 
Her Isbal only. By deep sorrow quell'd, 
Xarifa's was a melancholy love. 
The plashing waters, the blue sky above, 
The echo speaking from the distant hill, 
The murmurs indistinct which sweetly fill 
The evening air--all had for her a tone 
Of mournful music--and I stood alone 
The one thing that could bid her heart rejoice 
With the deep comfort of a human voice. 

Not so, young Miriam. Love, within her breast, 
Had been a welcome and familiar guest 
Ev'n from her childhood:--I was link'd with all 
The sunny things that to her lot might fall; 
The past--the present--and the future, were 
Replete with joys in which I had my share. 
Nothing had been, or ever could be, felt 
Singly, within the heart where such love dwelt-- 
Her birds, her trees, her favourite walks, her flowers, 
She knew them not as hers--they were all ours. 
And thus she loved in her imaginings 
Our earth, and all its dumb and living things; 
Oft whispering in her momentary glee, 
It was the world I dwelt in; part of me: 
And, bound by a sweet charm she might not break, 
She look'd upon that world, and loved it for my sake. 

'How shall I tell it? Linda, a dark pain 
Is in my heart, and in my burning brain.-- 
Where is she?--where is Miriam?--who art thou? 
Oh! wipe the death-dew from her pallid brow; 
I dare not touch her! See, how still she lies, 
Closing in weakness her averted eyes: 
Gaspingly struggling for her gentle breath-- 
And stretching out her quivering limbs in death! 

Will no one save her? Fool!--the shadow there 
Is the creation of thine own despair. 
No love, no agony, is in her heart: 
In sin, in suffering, she hath now no part. 
She is gone from thee--sooner doom'd to go 
Than Nature meant; but thou didst will it so. 

'Oh, Linda! the remembrance of that day, 
When sad Xarifa's spirit pass'd away, 
Haunted me ever with a power that thou, 
Who hast not sinn'd or suffer'd, canst not know. 
My joys were turn'd to miseries, and wrought 
My heart into delirium; I thought 
That, as she wept, so Miriam would weep, 
And start and murmur in her troubled sleep: 
That, as she doubted, Miriam too would find 
A dark suspicion steal across her mind: 
That, as she faded, Miriam too would fade, 
And lose the smile that round her full lips play'd: 
That as she perish'd--Miriam too would die, 
And chide me with her last reproachful sigh. 
Often when gazing on her open brow, 
And the pure crimson of her soft cheek's glow-- 
Sudden, a dark unhappy change would seem 
To fall upon her features like a dream. 

In vain her merry voice, with laughing tone, 
Bade the dim shadow from my heart begone: 
Pale--pale and sorrowful--she seem'd to rise, 
Death on her cheek, and darkness in her eyes; 
The roundness of her form was gone, and care 
Had blanch'd the tresses of her glossy hair. 
Wan and reproachful, mournfully and mild 
Her thin lips moved, and with an effort smiled. 
And when with writhing agony I woke 
From the delusion, and the dark spell broke; 
And Miriam stood there, smiling brilliantly, 
Shuddering, I said, 'And yet these things must be.' 
Must be;--that young confiding heart must shrink 
From my caress; the joyous eyes which drink 
Light from the sunshine that doth play within, 
Must grovel downcast with a sense of sin; 
Or, startled into consciousness, will gaze 
Bewilderingly upon the sunset rays; 
And, meeting mine, with sorrow wild and deep, 
Heart and eyes sinking, turn again to weep. 
Yes, these things must be: if, when years have pass'd, 
Each leaving her more fading than the last, 
She turns to the companion of her track, 
And, while her wandering thoughts roam sadly back, 
Seeks in her soul the reason why his form 
Laughs at the slow decay or ruffling storm, 

That hath wreck'd better things;--while on her sight, 
With the deep horrible glare, and certain light 
Of hell to a lost soul, the slow truth breaks; 
Till, as one wounded in his sleep, awakes 
To writhe, and shriek, and perish--silently: 
Her heart is roused--to comprehend and die. 

'To die!--and wherefore should she not depart 
Ere doubt hath agonized the trusting heart? 
Wherefore not pass away from earth, ere yet 
Its mossy bosom with her tears is wet?-- 
It was a summer's morning, when the first 
Glance of that dreadful haunting vision burst 
Upon my mind:--I doom'd her then to die, 
For then I pictured to my heart and eye 
A world where Miriam was not:--often after, 
Amid the joyous ringing of her laughter, 
In sunshine and in shade, those thoughts return'd, 
Madden'd my brain, and in my bosom burn'd. 
When softly bending o'er her fragrant flowers, 
She form'd her innocent plans, and playfully 
Spoke of that future which was not to be! 
How bitter were her smiles--her perfect love-- 
Her deep reliance, which no frowns could move, 

On the affections of my murderous heart, 
Where the thought brooded,--when shall she depart? 
As Jephthah gazed upon her smiling face, 
Who bounded forth to claim his first embrace; 
And felt, with breathless and bewilder'd pause, 
Her early death foredoom'd--her love the cause: 
As Jephthah struggled with the vow that still 
Bound his pain'd soul against his own free will; 
And heard her fond and meekly-worded prayer, 
To climb the well-known hills, and wander there, 
Weeping to think that in her virgin pride 
The beautiful must perish--no man's bride; 
And that her name must die away from earth; 
And that her voice must leave the halls of mirth, 
And they be not less mirthful: so to me 
It was to gaze on Miriam silently: 
Miriam, who loved me; who, if I had said, 
'Lo! thou must perish--bow thy gentle head,'-- 
Would have repress'd each faint life-longing sigh, 
Bared her white bosom, and knelt down to die, 
Without a murmur.--So when she upraised 
Her quiet eyes, and on my features gazed, 
Asking me to come forth and roam with her 
Around her favourite haunts, the maddening stir 
Of agony and vain resolve would rend 
My bosom, and to earth my proud head bend. 

It seem'd to me as if that gentle prayer 
She breathed--to bid farewell to all her share 
Of life and sunshine; to behold again 
The high bright happy hills and outstretch'd plain; 
And then--come back and die. I left that isle, 
And Miriam follow'd with a tearful smile, 
Glad to be with me, sorrowful to go 
From the dear scene of joy and transient woe. 
As Eve to Eden--towards that land of rest 
She gazed, then turn'd, and wept upon my breast. 
To Italy's sweet shores we bent our course; 
And for a while my grief and my remorse, 
And all my fearful thoughts, forsook me, when 
We mingled in the busy haunts of men. 
But oh! the hour was fix'd--though long delay'd; 
Like the poor felon's doom, which some reprieve hath stay'd. 

'One night a dream disturb'd my frenzied soul. 
Methought, to Miriam I confess'd the whole 
Of what thou know'st, and watch'd her young glad face, 
That on her brow her feelings I might trace. 
Methought that, as I gazed, the flushing red 
Once more upon her cheek and bosom spread, 
As when she told her love; and then--and then-- 
(How strongly does that vision rise again!) 

Each hue of life by gradual shades withdrew, 
Till ev'n her dark blue eyes seem'd fading too. 
Paler and paler--whiter and more white-- 
Gazing upon me in the ghastly light, 
Her features grew; till all at length did seem 
Like moving marble, in that sickly dream, 
Except the faded eyes; they faintly kept 
The hue of life, and look'd on me, and wept. 
And still she spoke not, but stood weeping there, 
Till I was madden'd with mine own despair-- 
And woke. She lay beside me, who was soon 
To perish by my hand: the pale clear moon 
O'er her fair form a marble whiteness threw, 
And wild within my heart the madness grew. 
I rush'd from out that chamber, and I stood 
By the dim waters of the moon-lit flood; 
And in that hour of frantic misery, 
I thought my vision told how she would die, 
Pining and weeping.--I return'd again, 
And gazed upon her with a sickening pain. 
Her fair soft arms were flung above her head, 
And the deep rose of sleep her cheek was tinging: 
The tear which all who follow me must shed, 
Slept 'neath the lashes which those orbs were fringing. 
And there she lay--so still, so statue-like-- 
I stagger'd to her-- 

I lifted up my desperate arm to strike-- 
Linda--I slew her! 
Once--only once--she faintly strove to rise; 
Once--only once--she call'd upon my name; 
And o'er the dark blue heaven of those eyes, 
Death, with its midnight shadows, slowly came. 
That tone's despairing echo died away; 
The last faint quivering pulsation ceased 
To thrill that form of beauty, as it lay 
From all the storms and cares of life released: 
And I sat by the dead. Fast o'er my soul 
A dream of memory's treasured relics stole. 
And the day rose before me, and the hour, 
When Miriam sat within her own sweet bower, 
The red rich sunset lighting on her cheek; 
Afraid to trust herself to move or speak, 
Conscious and shrinking--while I strove to trace 
Her bosom's secret on her guileless face. 
I turn'd to press her to my burning heart-- 
I that had slain her--Wherefore did I start? 
Cold, pure, and pale, that glowing cheek was laid, 
And motionless each marble limb was lying; 
Closed were those eyes which tears of passion shed, 
And hush'd the voice that call'd on me in dying. 
Gone!--gone!--that frozen bosom never more, 
Press'd to mine own, in rapture shall be beating: 
Gone!--gone!--her love, her struggles--all was o'er, 
Life--weary life, would bring for us no meeting! 

'They bore her from me, and they laid her low, 
With all her beauty, in the cheerless tomb; 
And dragg'd me forth, all weak with pain and woe, 
Heedless of death, to meet a murderer's doom. 
The wheel--the torturing wheel--was placed to tear 
Each quivering limb, and wring forth drops of pain; 
And they did mock me in my mute despair, 
And point to it, and frown--but all in vain. 
The hour at length arrived--a bright sweet day 
Rose o'er the world of torture, and of crime; 
And human blood-hounds and wild birds of prey 
Waited with eagerness their feasting time. 
And as I gazed, a wild hope sprang within 
My feverish breast:--perchance this dreadful death 
And my past sufferings might efface my sin; 
And I might now resign my weary breath. 
And as the blessed thought flash'd o'er my mind, 
I gazed around, and smiled.--To die--to die-- 
Oh little thought those wolves of human kind, 
What rapture in that word may sometimes lie! 
They stripp'd my unresisting limbs, and bound; 
And the huge ponderous engine gave a sound 

Like a dull heavy echo of the moans, 
The exhausted cries, the deep and sullen groans, 
Of all its many victims. Through each vein 
Thrill'd the strange sense of swift and certain pain; 
And each strong muscle from the blood-stain'd rack, 
Conscious of suffering, quiveringly shrank back. 
But I rejoiced--I say I did rejoice: 
And when from the loud multitude a voice 
Cried 'Death!' I wildly echoed it, and said 
'Death! Death! oh, lay me soon among the dead.' 
And they did gaze on me with fiendish stare, 
Half curiosity, and half the glare 
Of bloody appetite; while to and fro, 
Nearer and nearer, wheel'd the carrion crow, 
As seeking where to strike.--A pause, and hark! 
The signal sound! 
When sudden as a dream, the heavens grew dark 
On all around: 
And the loud blast came sweeping in its wrath, 
Scattering wide desolation o'er its path: 
And the hoarse thunder struggled on its way; 
And livid lightning mock'd the darken'd day 
With its faint hellish lights.--They fled, that crowd, 
With fearful shrieks, and cries, and murmurs loud, 
And left me bound. The awful thunder crash'd 
Above my head; and in my up-turn'd eyes 

The gleams of forked fire brightly flash'd, 
Then died along the dark and threatening skies: 
And the wild howling of the fearful wind 
Madden'd my ringing brain; while, swiftly driven, 
The torrent showers fell all thick and blind, 
Till mingling seem'd the earth and angry heaven, 
A flash--a sound--a shock--and I was free-- 
Prostrate beside me lay the shiver'd wheel 
In broken fragments--I groan'd heavily, 
And for a while I ceased to breathe or feel. 

'And I arose again, to know that death 
Was not yet granted--that the feverish hope 
Of yielding up in torture my cursed breath 
Was quench'd for ever; and the boundless scope 
Of weary life burst on my soul again, 
Like the dim distance of the heaving main 
On some lost mariner's faint failing eyes; 
Who, fondly dreaming of his native shore, 
(While in his throat the gurgling waters rise) 
Fancies he breathes that welcome air once more, 
And far across the bleak lone billows sees 
Its blue cool rivers, and its shady trees; 
Till when, upraised a moment by the wave, 
He views the watery waste, and sickening draws 
One long last gasping sigh for a green grave, 
Ere helplessly he sinks in Ocean's yawning jaws. 

'Night fell around. The quiet dews were weeping 
Silently on the dark and mournful earth; 
And Sorrow pale its sleepless watch was keeping, 
And slumber weigh'd the closing lid of mirth; 
While the full round-orb'd moon look'd calmly down 
From her thin cloud, as from a light-wreathed crown: 
And I went out beneath her silver beams; 
And through my 'wilder'd brain there pass'd dark dreams 
Of Miriam, and of misery, and death; 
And of that tomb, and what lay hid beneath: 
And I did lay my head upon that grave, 
Weepingly calling on her gentle name; 
And to the winds my grieving spirit gave 
In words which half without my knowledge came:-- 

'Thou art gone, with all thy loveliness, 
To the silence of the tomb, 
Where the voice of friends can never bless, 
Nor the cool sweet breezes come; 
Deep, deep beneath the flowers bright, 
Beneath the dark blue sky, 
Which may not send its joyous light 
To gladden those who die. 
This world to thee was not a world of woe: 
My bird of beauty! wherefore didst thou go? 

'Thou art gone, and gone for ever--thou 
In whom my life was bound: 
The seal of death is on thy brow, 
And in thy breast a wound. 
Who could have slain thee, thou who wert 
So helpless and so fair? 
When strong arms rose to do thee hurt, 
Why was not Isbal there? 
Didst thou not call upon him in thy woe? 
My bird of beauty! wherefore didst thou go? 

'Thou art gone!--Oh! fain my heart would rest, 
And dream--but thou art gone; 
The head that lay upon my breast 
Is hid beneath that stone. 
And art thou there? and wilt thou ne'er 
Rise up from that dark place, 
And, shaking back thy glossy hair, 
Laugh gladly in my face? 
This world to thee was not a world of woe: 
I loved thee--wherefore, wherefore didst thou go? 

'Return, return! Oh! if the rack-- 
If nature's death-like strife, 
Borne silently, could bring thee back 
Once more to light, and life: 
Ev'n if those lips that used to wreathe 
Smiles that a glory shed, 
Ne'er parted but in scorn, to breathe 
Dark curses on my head:-- 
Oh! I could bear it all, nor think it woe: 
My bird of beauty! wherefore didst thou go? 

'Once more--once more--oh! yet once more! 
If I could see thee stand, 
A breathing creature, as before 
I smote thee with this hand. 
If that dear voice--oh! must these groans, 
This agony be vain? 
Will no one lift the ponderous stones, 
And let thee rise again? 
Thou wert not wont in life to work me woe: 
My bird of beauty! wherefore didst thou go?' 

'And then I reason'd--Wherefore should the sod 
I have the power again that form to see-- 
I have the wish once more with her to be: 
And wherefore should we fear to look upon 
What, from our sight, some few short hours is gone? 
Wherefore the thrill our senses which comes o'er 
At sight of what shall breathe and feel no more? 
Oh! Miriam, can there be indeed a place 
Where I must dread to look upon thy face?-- 
And then I knelt, and desperately did tear 
The earth from off that form so young and fair, 
And dash'd aside the sods which heavily 
Press'd on the bosom which had beat for me. 
At length 'twas over;--at the break of day 
The scatter'd fragments round about me lay; 
And we once more were seated side by side-- 
The half-immortal, and his victim bride! 
What the grave yet had had no power to change, 
Her long bright locks, these fingers did arrange 
As she had worn them in her life's short spring; 
And the sweet flowers which lay half withering 
Upon the turf, I wreathed with pains and care, 
And braided them among her glossy hair. 
And the rich glow of light burst on mine eyes; 
And the bright morning, with her dark blue skies, 

Beam'd on the pale and faded form, that lay 
Cold and unconscious in the waking day. 
And forms drew round me, in a busy crowd: 
But though I saw them come, I heeded not, 
But call'd on Miriam with upbraidings loud, 
And clung to that beloved and fatal spot. 
And rude hands dragg'd me thence. I know not how 
Or where they fetter'd me; but when I woke 
From that night's dream, with cooler pulse and brow, 
Chains hung around me, which might not be broke, 
And in a damp deep dungeon I was flung, 
With scarce a gleam of heaven's sweet light to cheer, 
And silence round, save when my irons rung, 
Or the stern keeper's foot was drawing near. 
And many a weary day and sleepless night, 
I sat unmoved within that wretched cell, 
Dreaming confusedly of that last sight, 
The alter'd form of her I loved so well.

'Miriam! my Miriam!'--Such the first faint word 
Which burst my trembling lip with deep low sighs, 
Unconscious that the frowning keeper heard, 
And gazed with half-contempt, and half-surprise. 
And then I raved, and with a shaking hand 
Traced that dear name upon the dewy clay, 
And strove with feeble limbs to rise and stand, 
Greeting the vision'd form that might not stay. 

And they did call me mad--oh! such his madness 
Who having lost what he half fear'd to love, 
Deep from his prison dungeon's gloomy sadness 
Sent forth his spirit by her side to rove, 
And dreamt of love, and Italy's sweet skies, 
And Leonora's proud impassion'd eyes; 
And from his world of misery gazed afar 
On his own dream, as on a lovely star. 

'And from the earth I imaged forth a form, 
And call'd it Miriam, and would smile to see 
How calmly, amid all my passion's storm, 
Its stedfast rayless eyes still gazed on me. 
And I did love it, with a love beyond 
All that I felt before, except for her: 
And call'd to it, till, feverishly fond, 
I thought the clay began to speak and stir. 



'One day I slept--I had not slept for long, 
Long weary days and nights ;--and in my ear 
Rang the sweet notes of Miriam's gentle song, 
Which ev'n in that lone rest I smiled to hear:-- 

'The world--the sunny world!--I love 
To roam untired, till evening throws 
Sweet shadows in the pleasant grove; 
And bees are murmuring on the rose. 
I love to see the changeful flowers 
Lie blushing in the glowing day, 
Bend down their heads to 'scape the showers, 
Then shake the chilly drops away.' 

'I woke and saw my keeper by me stand; 
And curiously he gazed, with wondering eyes, 
On the form moulded by my frantic hand, 
And sternly bade me from my bed arise. 
Oh! well my heart foreboded from his brow: 
Methinks I see the dark stern glances now, 
With which he heard my tale, for I did kneel 
And swear each secret feeling to reveal, 
So he would leave my precious Miriam there, 
To comfort Isbal in his lone despair. 
He heard: and o'er that dark and sullen brow 
A smile ev'n darker pass'd; and he did throw 
That image rudely on the echoing ground, 
And spurn'd in scorn the broken fragments round; 
And call'd me madman, and the threaten'd scourge 
Shook o'er my fetter'd limbs, his words to urge. 
He left me--madness did not come till then 
In spite of all I suffer'd.--Till that hour 

I had distinguish'd all, like other men, 
Nor sunk beneath misfortune's blasting power. 
But then, I felt a circling in my brain; 
A laugh convulsive in my choking breast; 
A starting in each heavy temple vein, 
A weight which all my shivering limbs oppress'd. 
Through my bewilder'd brain the warm blood rush'd, 
From my distended mouth in torrents gush'd; 
And with a low sick sob I sank in pain, 
Trusting no more to wake or breathe again. 

'Days, months, and years roll'd on, and I had been 
A prisoner a century; had seen 
Change after change among my keepers; heard 
The shrieks of new-made captives, (which oft stirr'd 
My heart again to madness) and the groans 
Of those whom death released; the low faint moans 
Of the exhausted; and I yet remain'd 
To my dark dungeon, and existence, chain'd. 
But wherefore should I struggle thus, to show 
The dull monotony of endless woe? 
Suffice it, that it was amongst a race 
Then, yet unborn, that I beheld thy face-- 
Thy angel face, for whom ev'n I would crave 
A few years respite from the welcome grave.' 

He ceased; and with a tearless deep despair, 
Turn'd to the sad one who sat by him there; 
And neither spoke;--but o'er his wasted frame 
A shaking, as of strong convulsion, came: 
And, taking her faint hand between his own, 
Quivering he press'd it, with a heavy groan; 
And look'd into her face, as if to read 
His fate therein--and bow'd his grief-worn head 
Upon his arms awhile; then started up 
To live--or drink the dregs of sorrow's cup. 
And she rose too, who had been sitting by, 
Gazing upon those dark curls vacantly; 
And once or twice half-bending, as she would 
Have press'd her lips on them--though stain'd with blood, 
She rose, and when he murmur'd forth his fears-- 
'Is it too horrible? must I depart?' 
Look'd up, and with an agony of tears, 
Spread forth her arms, and clasp'd him to her heart. 

There was a road ran past our house
Too lovely to explore.
I asked my mother once—she said
That if you followed where it led
It brought you to the milk-man's door.
(That's why I have not travelled more.)


The unforbidden mistake that you and only you would make 
doen’t run to me with any questions 
so the answers shall not end and break.
The open fire extinguishes the heat between our stick figures. 
as it glows against the pale stiff skin. 
Shredding against the done to have high self esteem
as the heart keeps aching. 
Don’t wait here by my side as a critical ride 
may spring towards me. 
don’t wait to hold my heart in your cold end hands 
as to waiting for my love again
 is like waiting for rain on a hot summer day useless
 and disappointing 
don’t wait for my unless you love me
 I don’t need another person i love to leave me. 
Don’t do it so abrupt don’t push me through the hard hitting nails 
and shrieking voices echoing on and on. 
Only you would make the unforbidden mistake, you and only you.



Alas, how pleasant are their dayes
With whom the Infant Love yet playes!
Sorted by pairs, they still are seen
By Fountains cool, and Shadows green.
But soon these Flames do lose their light,
Like Meteors of a Summers night:
Nor can they to that Region climb,
To make impression upon Time.

'Twas in a Shipwrack, when the Seas
Rul'd, and the Winds did what they please,
That my poor Lover floting lay,
And, e're brought forth, was cast away:
Till at the last the master-Wave.
Upon the Rock his Mother drave;
And there she split against the Stone,
In a Cesarian Section.

The Sea him lent these bitter Tears
Which at his Eyes he alwaies bears.
And from the Winds the Sighs he bore,
Which through his surging Breast do roar.
No Day he saw but that which breaks,
Through frighted Clouds in forked streaks.
While round the ratling Thunder hurl'd,
As at the Fun'ral of the World.

While Nature to his Birth presents
This masque of quarrelling Elements;
A num'rous fleet of Corm'rants black,
That sail'd insulting o're the Wrack,
Receiv'd into their cruel Care,
Th' unfortunate and abject Heir:
Guardians most fit to entertain
The Orphan of the Hurricane.

They fed him up with Hopes and Air,
Which soon digested to Despair.
And as one Corm'rant fed him, still
Another on his Heart did bill.
Thus while they famish him, and feast,
He both consumed, and increast:
And languished with doubtful Breath,
Th' Amphibium of Life and Death.

And now, when angry Heaven wou'd
Behold a spectacle of Blood,
Fortune and He are call'd to play
At sharp before it all the day:
And Tyrant Love his brest does ply
With all his wing'd Artillery.
Whilst he, betwixt the Flames and Waves,
Like Ajax, the mad Tempest braves.

See how he nak'd and fierce does stand,
Cuffing the Thunder with one hand;
While with the other he does lock,
And grapple, with the stubborn Rock:
From which he with each Wave rebounds,
Torn into Flames, and ragg'd with Wounds.
And all he saies, a Lover drest
In his own Blood does relish best.

This is the only Banneret
That ever Love created yet:
Who though, by the Malignant Starrs,
Forced to live in Storms and Warrs;
Yet dying leaves a Perfume here,
And Musick within every Ear:
And he in Story only rules,
In a Field Sable a Lover Gules. 




The saintly hermit, midway through his prayers
stopped suddenly, and raised his eyes to witness
the unbelievable: for there before him stood
the legendary creature, startling white, that
had approached, soundlessly, pleading with his eyes.

The legs, so delicately shaped, balanced a
body wrought of finest ivory. And as
he moved, his coat shone like reflected moonlight.
High on his forehead rose the magic horn, the sign
of his uniqueness: a tower held upright 
by his alert, yet gentle, timid gait.

The mouth of softest tints of rose and grey, when
opened slightly, revealed his gleaming teeth,
whiter than snow. The nostrils quivered faintly:
he sought to quench his thirst, to rest and find repose.
His eyes looked far beyond the saint's enclosure,
reflecting vistas and events long vanished,
and closed the circle of this ancient mystic legend. 



Nobody can impress
This poet, this genius, 
Who hates being under stress.
This thinker wants to rest
In peace: that's his justice, 
And to stay away from all pests, 
And all types of slimy grease.
He urges all to leave him alone, 
So he can lay down his bone. 

When the trumpet sounded, it was 
all prepared on the earth, 
to Coca Cola, Inc., Anaconda, 
Ford Motors, and other entities: 
The Fruit Company, Inc. 
reserved for itself the most succulent, 
the central coast of my own land, 
the delicate waist of America. 
It rechristened its territories 
as the ’Banana Republics’ 
and over the sleeping dead, 
over the restless heroes 
who brought about the greatness, the liberty and the flags, 
it established the comic opera: 
abolished the independencies, 
presented crowns of Caesar, 
unsheathed envy, attracted 
the dictatorship of the flies, 
Trujillo flies, Tacho flies, 
Carias flies, Martines flies, 
Ubico flies, damp flies 
of modest blood and marmalade, 
drunken flies who zoom 
over the ordinary graves, 
circus flies, wise flies 
well trained in tyranny.

Among the blood-thirsty flies 
the Fruit Company lands its ships, 
taking off the coffee and the fruit; 
the treasure of our submerged 
territories flow as though 
on plates into the ships.

Meanwhile Indians are falling 
into the sugared chasms 
of the harbours, wrapped 
for burials in the mist of the dawn: 
a body rolls, a thing 
that has no name, a fallen cipher, 
a cluster of the dead fruit 
thrown down on the dump. 



Time immemorial carries His glory, 
Generations untold read His story, 
In all of our deepest Unconscious, 
He ever peeps as a live-touch.

He comes for us, -His creations 
To untie and cut the sickles of illusions, 
And makes us aware of our already in Divinity, 
Showing His image without and within, 
And when He leaves His mortal coil, 
He is felt, recognized, and worshiped in every shrine.

On Time's cyclic chariot , 
As Avatar He  takes frames and names, 
And creates Myths of Love and Service, 

He is an Oasis, a Sheet -Anchor, a Shelter of Faith, 
If in dire crisis, one cries, and seeks His help and support, 
Miracle He does, by a single touch, 
And lets the devotee feel that He is within. 

The universe with time and space
Made me find my life and place
Stars aligned for me to see
The greatest love for me to be
In infinite dimensions to transcend
My love for you will never end


~Sun~

Super bright
Ultra light
Never night


~Moon~

Mostly seen
On days in between
Only the new
And not often blue


~Stars~

Shining in the sky
Twinkling bright in my eye
Always glowing like a Firefly
Radiating splendour from high
Shining sparkles never die



There is an ominous death tone
Ringing louder than a telephone 
Set on maximum volume
For the near deaf
Or those still listening
From shallow graves.
Ear-piercing shrieks
Emanate from
Afternoon freaks
Gathering beneath rain clouds
To write murderous poetry, 
Entangled in new vines
In the jungle of disturbed minds.

I heard mutilated words
Spoken in schizophrenic confusion
While anger flared skyward, 
Incandescent heat consuming
Sacred love and harmony; 
The last tattered membranes
Of crippled reason
Were disintegrating
Like dried autumn leaves
Or an abandoned lover’s needs.



Books were opening
And fluttering around
Like agitated birds, 
While trapped ghosts, 
Suspended in useless time, 
Were frantically
Searching for holes
In the universe
Ever evolving into violence. 



Los Angeles hums
a little tune --
trucks down
the coast road
for Monday Market
packed with small faces
blinking in the dark.
My mother dreams
by the open window.
On the drainboard
the gray roast humps
untouched, the oven
bangs its iron jaws,
but it's over.
Before her on the table
set for so many
her glass of fire
goes out.
The childish photographs,
the letters and cards
scatter at last.
The dead burn alone
toward dawn. 




He says this time we mightn’t last
I’m changed but he says my actions are from the past
I love him
So much so I treat him like a king
Questions left unanswered
Thoughts left unheard
Sometimes I’m taken a back
I’ll continue to be subtle me
Ignore the entities out there because their purpose is to sidetrack
I’ll remember where I stand, smile and continue on my straight journey
I am yet to understand there’s so much only one person can do
With that being said I’ll put my trust in him in us so we could see it true.
In my quarters I shall dwell
And as for us ‘will we make it? ’ only time will tell


Proem

‘Many speak wisely, some inerrably:
Witness the beast who talk'd that should have bray'd,
And Caiaphas that said
Expedient 'twas for all that One should die;
But what avails
When Love's right accent from their wisdom fails,
And the Truth-criers know not what they cry!
Say, wherefore thou,
As under bondage of some bitter vow,
Warblest no word,
When all the rest are shouting to be heard?
Why leave the fervid running just when Fame
'Gan whispering of thy name
Amongst the hard-pleased Judges of the Course?
Parch'd is thy crystal-flowing source?
Pierce, then, with thought's steel probe, the trodden ground,
Till passion's buried floods be found;
Intend thine eye
Into the dim and undiscover'd sky
Whose lustres are the pulsings of the heart,
And promptly, as thy trade is, watch to chart
The lonely suns, the mystic hazes and throng'd sparkles bright
That, named and number'd right
In sweet, transpicuous words, shall glow alway
With Love's three-stranded ray,
Red wrath, compassion golden, lazuline delight.’ 

Thus in reproof of my despondency,
My Mentor; and thus I:

O, season strange for song!
And yet some timely power persuades my lips.
Is't England's parting soul that nerves my tongue,
As other Kingdoms, nearing their eclipse,
Have, in their latest bards, uplifted strong
The voice that was their voice in earlier days?
Is it her sudden, loud and piercing cry,
The note which those that seem too weak to sigh
Will sometimes utter just before they die?

Lo, weary of the greatness of her ways,
There lies my Land, with hasty pulse and hard,
Her ancient beauty marr'd,
And, in her cold and aimless roving sight,
Horror of light;
Sole vigour left in her last lethargy,
Save when, at bidding of some dreadful breath,
The rising death
Rolls up with force;
And then the furiously gibbering corse
Shakes, panglessly convuls'd, and sightless stares,
Whilst one Physician pours in rousing wines,
One anodynes,
And one declares
That nothing ails it but the pains of growth.

My last look loth
Is taken; and I turn, with the relief
Of knowing that my life-long hope and grief
Are surely vain,
To that unshapen time to come, when She,
A dim, heroic Nation long since dead,
The foulness of her agony forgot,
Shall all benignly shed
Through ages vast
The ghostly grace of her transfigured past 
Over the present, harass'd and forlorn,
Of nations yet unborn;
And this shall be the lot
Of those who, in the bird-voice and the blast
Of her omniloquent tongue,
Have truly sung
Or greatly said,
To shew as one
With those who have best done,
And be as rays,
Thro' the still altering world, around her changeless head.

Therefore no 'plaint be mine
Of listeners none,
No hope of render'd use or proud reward,
In hasty times and hard;
But chants as of a lonely thrush's throat
At latest eve,
That does in each calm note
Both joy and grieve;
Notes few and strong and fine,
Gilt with sweet day's decline,
And sad with promise of a different sun.

'Mid the loud concert harsh
Of this fog-folded marsh,
To me, else dumb,
Uranian Clearness, come!
Give me to breathe in peace and in surprise
The light-thrill'd ether of your rarest skies,
Till inmost absolution start
The welling in the grateful eyes,
The heaving in the heart.
Winnow with sighs
And wash away
With tears the dust and stain of clay,
Till all the Song be Thine, as beautiful as Morn, 
Bedeck'd with shining clouds of scorn;
And Thou, Inspirer, deign to brood
O'er the delighted words, and call them Very Good.
This grant, Clear Spirit; and grant that I remain
Content to ask unlikely gifts in vain. 

I
Saint Valentine’s Day

Well dost thou, Love, thy solemn Feast to hold
In vestal February;
Not rather choosing out some rosy day
From the rich coronet of the coming May,
When all things meet to marry!

O, quick, praevernal Power
That signall'st punctual through the sleepy mould
The Snowdrop's time to flower,
Fair as the rash oath of virginity
Which is first-love's first cry;
O, Baby Spring,
That flutter'st sudden 'neath the breast of Earth
A month before the birth;
Whence is the peaceful poignancy,
The joy contrite,
Sadder than sorrow, sweeter than delight,
That burthens now the breath of everything,
Though each one sighs as if to each alone
The cherish'd pang were known?
At dusk of dawn, on his dark spray apart,
With it the Blackbird breaks the young Day's heart;
In evening's hush
About it talks the heavenly-minded Thrush; 
The hill with like remorse
Smiles to the Sun's smile in his westering course;
The fisher's drooping skiff
In yonder sheltering bay;
The choughs that call about the shining cliff;
The children, noisy in the setting ray;
Own the sweet season, each thing as it may;
Thoughts of strange kindness and forgotten peace
In me increase;
And tears arise
Within my happy, happy Mistress' eyes,
And, lo, her lips, averted from my kiss,
Ask from Love's bounty, ah, much more than bliss!

Is't the sequester'd and exceeding sweet
Of dear Desire electing his defeat?
Is't the waked Earth now to yon purpling cope
Uttering first-love's first cry,
Vainly renouncing, with a Seraph's sigh,
Love's natural hope?
Fair-meaning Earth, foredoom'd to perjury!
Behold, all amorous May,
With roses heap'd upon her laughing brows,
Avoids thee of thy vows!
Were it for thee, with her warm bosom near,
To abide the sharpness of the Seraph's sphere?
Forget thy foolish words;
Go to her summons gay,
Thy heart with dead, wing'd Innocencies fill'd,
Ev'n as a nest with birds
After the old ones by the hawk are kill'd.

Well dost thou, Love, to celebrate
The noon of thy soft ecstasy,
Or e'er it be too late,
Or e'er the Snowdrop die!


II 
Wind And Wave

The wedded light and heat,
Winnowing the witless space,
Without a let,
What are they till they beat
Against the sleepy sod, and there beget
Perchance the violet!
Is the One found,
Amongst a wilderness of as happy grace,
To make Heaven's bound;
So that in Her
All which it hath of sensitively good
Is sought and understood
After the narrow mode the mighty Heavens prefer?
She, as a little breeze
Following still Night,
Ripples the spirit's cold, deep seas
Into delight;
But, in a while,
The immeasurable smile
Is broke by fresher airs to flashes blent
With darkling discontent;
And all the subtle zephyr hurries gay,
And all the heaving ocean heaves one way,
T'ward the void sky-line and an unguess'd weal;
Until the vanward billows feel
The agitating shallows, and divine the goal,
And to foam roll,
And spread and stray
And traverse wildly, like delighted hands,
The fair and fleckless sands;
And so the whole 
Unfathomable and immense
Triumphing tide comes at the last to reach
And burst in wind-kiss'd splendours on the deaf'ning beach,
Where forms of children in first innocence
Laugh and fling pebbles on the rainbow'd crest
Of its untired unrest.


III 
Winter

I, singularly moved
To love the lovely that are not beloved,
Of all the Seasons, most
Love Winter, and to trace
The sense of the Trophonian pallor on her face.
It is not death, but plenitude of peace;
And the dim cloud that does the world enfold
Hath less the characters of dark and cold
Than warmth and light asleep,
And correspondent breathing seems to keep
With the infant harvest, breathing soft below
Its eider coverlet of snow.
Nor is in field or garden anything
But, duly look'd into, contains serene
The substance of things hoped for, in the Spring,
And evidence of Summer not yet seen.
On every chance-mild day
That visits the moist shaw,
The honeysuckle, 'sdaining to be crost
In urgence of sweet life by sleet or frost,
'Voids the time's law
With still increase 
Of leaflet new, and little, wandering spray;
Often, in sheltering brakes,
As one from rest disturb'd in the first hour,
Primrose or violet bewilder'd wakes,
And deems 'tis time to flower;
Though not a whisper of her voice he hear,
The buried bulb does know
The signals of the year,
And hails far Summer with his lifted spear.
The gorse-field dark, by sudden, gold caprice,
Turns, here and there, into a Jason's fleece;
Lilies, that soon in Autumn slipp'd their gowns of green,
And vanish'd into earth,
And came again, ere Autumn died, to birth,
Stand full-array'd, amidst the wavering shower,
And perfect for the Summer, less the flower;
In nook of pale or crevice of crude bark,
Thou canst not miss,
If close thou spy, to mark
The ghostly chrysalis,
That, if thou touch it, stirs in its dream dark;
And the flush'd Robin, in the evenings hoar,
Does of Love's Day, as if he saw it, sing;
But sweeter yet than dream or song of Summer or Spring
Are Winter's sometime smiles, that seem to well
From infancy ineffable;
Her wandering, languorous gaze,
So unfamiliar, so without amaze,
On the elemental, chill adversity,
The uncomprehended rudeness; and her sigh
And solemn, gathering tear,
And look of exile from some great repose, the sphere
Of ether, moved by ether only, or
By something still more tranquil.


IV 
Beta

Of infinite Heaven the rays,
Piercing some eyelet in our cavern black,
Ended their viewless track
On thee to smite
Solely, as on a diamond stalactite,
And in mid-darkness lit a rainbow's blaze,
Wherein the absolute Reason, Power, and Love,
That erst could move
Mainly in me but toil and weariness,
Renounced their deadening might,
Renounced their undistinguishable stress
Of withering white,
And did with gladdest hues my spirit caress,
Nothing of Heaven in thee showing infinite,
Save the delight.


V 
The Day After To-Morrow 

Perchance she droops within the hollow gulf
Which the great wave of coming pleasure draws,
Not guessing the glad cause!
Ye Clouds that on your endless journey go,
Ye Winds that westward flow,
Thou heaving Sea
That heav'st 'twixt her and me, 
Tell her I come;
Then only sigh your pleasure, and be dumb;
For the sweet secret of our either self
We know.
Tell her I come,
And let her heart be still'd.
One day's controlled hope, and then one more,
And on the third our lives shall be fulfill'd!
Yet all has been before:
Palm placed in palm, twin smiles, and words astray.
What other should we say?
But shall I not, with ne'er a sign, perceive,
Whilst her sweet hands I hold,
The myriad threads and meshes manifold
Which Love shall round her weave:
The pulse in that vein making alien pause
And varying beats from this;
Down each long finger felt, a differing strand
Of silvery welcome bland;
And in her breezy palm
And silken wrist,
Beneath the touch of my like numerous bliss
Complexly kiss'd,
A diverse and distinguishable calm?
What should we say!
It all has been before;
And yet our lives shall now be first fulfill'd,
And into their summ'd sweetness fall distill'd
One sweet drop more;
One sweet drop more, in absolute increase
Of unrelapsing peace.

O, heaving Sea,
That heav'st as if for bliss of her and me,
And separatest not dear heart from heart,
Though each 'gainst other beats too far apart,
For yet awhile 
Let it not seem that I behold her smile.
O, weary Love, O, folded to her breast,
Love in each moment years and years of rest,
Be calm, as being not.
Ye oceans of intolerable delight,
The blazing photosphere of central Night,
Be ye forgot.
Terror, thou swarthy Groom of Bride-bliss coy,
Let me not see thee toy.
O, Death, too tardy with thy hope intense
Of kisses close beyond conceit of sense;
O, Life, too liberal, while to take her hand
Is more of hope than heart can understand;
Perturb my golden patience not with joy,
Nor, through a wish, profane
The peace that should pertain
To him who does by her attraction move.
Has all not been before?
One day's controlled hope, and one again,
And then the third, and ye shall have the rein,
O Life, Death, Terror, Love!
But soon let your unrestful rapture cease,
Ye flaming Ethers thin,
Condensing till the abiding sweetness win
One sweet drop more;
One sweet drop more in the measureless increase
Of honied peace.


VI 
Tristitia 

Darling, with hearts conjoin'd in such a peace
That Hope, so not to cease,
Must still gaze back,
And count, along our love's most happy track,
The landmarks of like inconceiv'd increase,
Promise me this:
If thou alone should'st win
And I, beguiled by gracious-seeming sin,
Say, loving too much thee,
Love's last goal miss,
And any vows may then have memory,
Never, by grief for what I bear or lack,
To mar thy joyance of heav'n's jubilee.
Promise me this;
For else I should be hurl'd,
Beyond just doom
And by thy deed, to Death's interior gloom,
From the mild borders of the banish'd world
Wherein they dwell
Who builded not unalterable fate
On pride, fraud, envy, cruel lust, or hate;
Yet loved too laxly sweetness and heart's ease,

For such as these
Loss without measure, sadness without end!
Yet not for this do thou disheaven'd be
With thinking upon me.
Though black, when scann'd from heaven's surpassing bright, 
This might mean light,
Foil'd with the dim days of mortality.
Go down to deepest Hell, and He is there,
And, as a true but quite estranged Friend,
He works, 'gainst gnashing teeth of devilish ire,
With love deep hidden lest it be blasphemed,
If possible, to blend
Ease with the pangs of its inveterate fire;
Yea, in the worst
And from His Face most wilfully accurst
Of souls in vain redeem'd,
He does with potions of oblivion kill
Remorse of the lost Love that helps them still.

Apart from these,
Near the sky-borders of that banish'd world,
Wander pale spirits among willow'd leas,
Lost beyond measure, sadden'd without end,
But since, while erring most, retaining yet
Some ineffectual fervour of regret,
Retaining still such weal
As spurned Lovers feel,
Preferring far to all the world's delight
Their loss so infinite,
Or Poets, when they mark
In the clouds dun
A loitering flush of the long sunken sun,
And turn away with tears into the dark.

Know, Dear, these are not mine
But Wisdom's words, confirmed by divine
Doctors and Saints, though fitly seldom heard
Save in their own prepense-occulted word,
Lest fools be fool'd the further by false hope,
And wrest sweet knowledge to their own decline;
And (to approve I speak within my scope)
The Mistress of that dateless exile gray 
Is named in surpliced Schools Tristitia.

But, O, my Darling, look in thy heart and see
How unto me,
Secured of my prime care, thy happy state,
In the most unclean cell
Of sordid Hell,
And worried by the most ingenious hate,
It never could be anything but well,
Nor from my soul, full of thy sanctity,
Such pleasure die
As the poor harlot's, in whose body stirs
The innocent life that is and is not hers:
Unless, alas, this fount of my relief
By thy unheavenly grief
Were closed.
So, with a consecrating kiss
And hearts made one in past all previous peace,
And on one hope reposed,
Promise me this!


VII 
The Azalea

There, where the sun shines first
Against our room,
She train'd the gold Azalea, whose perfume
She, Spring-like, from her breathing grace dispersed.
Last night the delicate crests of saffron bloom,
For this their dainty likeness watch'd and nurst,
Were just at point to burst.
And groan'd aloud upon my wretched bed,
But lay, with eyes still closed,
Perfectly bless'd in the delicious sphere
By which I knew so well that she was near,
My heart to speechless thankfulness composed.
Till 'gan to stir
A dizzy somewhat in my troubled head—
It was the azalea's breath, and she was dead!
The warm night had the lingering buds disclosed,
And I had fall'n asleep with to my breast
A chance-found letter press'd
In which she said,
‘So, till to-morrow eve, my Own, adieu!
Parting's well-paid with soon again to meet,
Soon in your arms to feel so small and sweet,
Sweet to myself that am so sweet to you!’


VIII 
Departure

It was not like your great and gracious ways!
Do you, that have nought other to lament,
Never, my Love, repent
Of how, that July afternoon,
You went,
With sudden, unintelligible phrase,
And frighten'd eye,
Upon your journey of so many days,
Without a single kiss, or a good-bye?
I knew, indeed, that you were parting soon;
And so we sate, within the low sun's rays, 
You whispering to me, for your voice was weak,
Your harrowing praise.
Well, it was well,
To hear you such things speak,
And I could tell
What made your eyes a growing gloom of love,
As a warm South-wind sombres a March grove.
And it was like your great and gracious ways
To turn your talk on daily things, my Dear,
Lifting the luminous, pathetic lash
To let the laughter flash,
Whilst I drew near,
Because you spoke so low that I could scarcely hear.
But all at once to leave me at the last,
More at the wonder than the loss aghast,
With huddled, unintelligible phrase,
And frighten'd eye,
And go your journey of all days
With not one kiss, or a good-bye,
And the only loveless look the look with which you pass'd:
'Twas all unlike your great and gracious ways.


IX 
Eurydice

Is this the portent of the day nigh past,
And of a restless grave
O'er which the eternal sadness gathers fast;
Or but the heaped wave
Of some chance, wandering tide, 
Such as that world of awe
Whose circuit, listening to a foreign law,
Conjunctures ours at unguess'd dates and wide,
Does in the Spirit's tremulous ocean draw,
To pass unfateful on, and so subside?
Thee, whom ev'n more than Heaven loved I have,
And yet have not been true
Even to thee,
I, dreaming, night by night, seek now to see,
And, in a mortal sorrow, still pursue
Thro' sordid streets and lanes
And houses brown and bare
And many a haggard stair
Ochrous with ancient stains,
And infamous doors, opening on hapless rooms,
In whose unhaunted glooms
Dead pauper generations, witless of the sun,
Their course have run;
And ofttimes my pursuit
Is check'd of its dear fruit
By things brimful of hate, my kith and kin,
Furious that I should keep
Their forfeit power to weep,
And mock, with living fear, their mournful malice thin.
But ever, at the last, my way I win
To where, with perfectly sad patience, nurst
By sorry comfort of assured worst,
Ingrain'd in fretted cheek and lips that pine,
On pallet poor
Thou lyest, stricken sick,
Beyond love's cure,
By all the world's neglect, but chiefly mine.
Then sweetness, sweeter than my tongue can tell,
Does in my bosom well,
And tears come free and quick 
And more and more abound
For piteous passion keen at having found,
After exceeding ill, a little good;
A little good
Which, for the while,
Fleets with the current sorrow of the blood,
Though no good here has heart enough to smile.


X 
The Toys

My little Son, who look'd from thoughtful eyes
And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise,
Having my law the seventh time disobey'd,
I struck him, and dismiss'd
With hard words and unkiss'd,
His Mother, who was patient, being dead.
Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep,
I visited his bed,
But found him slumbering deep,
With darken'd eyelids, and their lashes yet
From his late sobbing wet.
And I, with moan,
Kissing away his tears, left others of my own;
For, on a table drawn beside his head,
He had put, within his reach,
A box of counters and a red-vein'd stone,
A piece of glass abraded by the beach
And six or seven shells,
A bottle with bluebells
And two French copper coins, ranged there with careful art,
To comfort his sad heart. 
So when that night I pray'd
Ah, when at last we lie with tranced breath,
Not vexing Thee in death,
And Thou rememberest of what toys
We made our joys,
How weakly understood,
Thy great commanded good,
Then, fatherly not less
Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay,
Thou'lt leave Thy wrath, and say,
‘I will be sorry for their childishness.’


XI 
Tired Memory

The stony rock of death's insensibility
Well'd yet awhile with honey of thy love
And then was dry;
Nor could thy picture, nor thine empty glove,
Nor all thy kind, long letters, nor the band
Which really spann'd
Thy body chaste and warm,
Thenceforward move
Upon the stony rock their wearied charm.
At last, then, thou wast dead.
Yet would I not despair,
But wrought my daily task, and daily said
Many and many a fond, unfeeling prayer,
To keep my vows of faith to thee from harm.
In vain.
‘For 'tis,’ I said, ‘all one, 
The wilful faith, which has no joy or pain,
As if 'twere none.’
Then look'd I miserably round
If aught of duteous love were left undone,
And nothing found.
But, kneeling in a Church, one Easter-Day,
It came to me to say:
‘Though there is no intelligible rest,
In Earth or Heaven,
For me, but on her breast,
I yield her up, again to have her given,
And the same night, in slumber lying,
I, who had dream'd of thee as sad and sick and dying,
And only so, nightly for all one year,
Did thee, my own most Dear,
Possess,
In gay, celestial beauty nothing coy,
And felt thy soft caress
With heretofore unknown reality of joy.
But, in our mortal air,
None thrives for long upon the happiest dream,
And fresh despair
Bade me seek round afresh for some extreme
Of unconceiv'd, interior sacrifice
Whereof the smoke might rise
And so,
In agony, I cried:
That I should crucify my heart,
Because my love has also been my pride,
I do submit, if I saw how, to bliss
Wherein She has no part.’
And I was heard,
And taken at my own remorseless word. 
O, my most Dear,
Was't treason, as I fear?
'Twere that, and worse, to plead thy veiled mind,
Kissing thy babes, and murmuring in mine ear,
‘Thou canst not be
Ah, prophet kind!
I heard, all dumb and blind
With tears of protest; and I cannot see
But faith was broken. Yet, as I have said,
My heart was dead,
Dead of devotion and tired memory,
When a strange grace of thee
In a fair stranger, as I take it, bred
To her some tender heed,
Most innocent
Of purpose therewith blent,
And pure of faith, I think, to thee; yet such
That the pale reflex of an alien love,
So vaguely, sadly shown,
Did her heart touch
Above
All that, till then, had woo'd her for its own.
And so the fear, which is love's chilly dawn,
Flush'd faintly upon lids that droop'd like thine,
And made me weak,
By thy delusive likeness doubly drawn,
And Nature's long suspended breath of flame
Persuading soft, and whispering Duty's name,
Awhile to smile and speak
With this thy Sister sweet, and therefore mine;
Thy Sister sweet,
Who bade the wheels to stir
Of sensitive delight in the poor brain,
Dead of devotion and tired memory,
So that I lived again, 
And, strange to aver,
With no relapse into the void inane,
For thee;
But (treason was't?) for thee and also her.


XII 
Magna Est Veritas

Here, in this little Bay,
Full of tumultuous life and great repose,
Where, twice a day,
The purposeless, glad ocean comes and goes,
Under high cliffs, and far from the huge town,
I sit me down.
For want of me the world's course will not fail:
When all its work is done, the lie shall rot;
The truth is great, and shall prevail,
When none cares whether it prevail or not.


XIII 
In the year of the great crime,
When the false English Nobles and their Jew,
The Trust they stood twice pledged to keep from wrong, 
One said, Take up thy Song,
That breathes the mild and almost mythic time
Of England's prime!
But I, Ah, me,
The freedom of the few
That, in our free Land, were indeed the free,
Can song renew?
Ill singing 'tis with blotting prison-bars,
How high soe'er, betwixt us and the stars;
Ill singing 'tis when there are none to hear;
And days are near
When England shall forget
The fading glow which, for a little while,
Illumes her yet,
The lovely smile
That grows so faint and wan,
Her people shouting in her dying ear,
Are not two daws worth two of any swan!

Ye outlaw'd Best, who yet are bright
With the sunken light,
Whose common style
Is Virtue at her gracious ease,
The flower of olden sanctities,
Ye haply trust, by love's benignant guile,
To lure the dark and selfish brood
To their own hated good;
Ye haply dream
Your lives shall still their charmful sway sustain,
Unstifled by the fever'd steam
That rises from the plain.
Know, 'twas the force of function high,
In corporate exercise, and public awe
Of Nature's, Heaven's, and England's Law
That Best, though mix'd with Bad, should reign,
Which kept you in your sky!
But, when the sordid Trader caught 
The loose-held sceptre from your hands distraught,
And soon, to the Mechanic vain,
Sold the proud toy for nought,
Your charm was broke, your task was sped,
Your beauty, with your honour, dead,
And though you still are dreaming sweet
Of being even now not less
Your hearts of their due heaviness.
Go, get you for your evil watching shriven!
Leave to your lawful Master's itching hands
Your unking'd lands,
But keep, at least, the dignity
Of deigning not, for his smooth use, to be,
Voteless, the voted delegates
Of his strange interests, loves and hates.
In sackcloth, or in private strife
With private ill, ye may please Heaven,
And soothe the coming pangs of sinking life;
And prayer perchance may win
And the orgies of the multitude,
Which now begin;
But do not hope to wave the silken rag
Of your unsanction'd flag,
And so to guide
The great ship, helmless on the swelling tide
Of that presumptuous Sea,
Unlit by sun or moon, yet inly bright
With lights innumerable that give no light,
Flames of corrupted will and scorn of right,
Rejoicing to be free.

And, now, because the dark comes on apace
When none can work for fear,
And Liberty in every Land lies slain,
And the two Tyrs unchallenged reign, 
And heavy prophecies, suspended long
At supplication of the righteous few,
And so discredited, to fulfilment throng,
Restrain'd no more by faithful prayer or tear,
And the dread baptism of blood seems near
That brings to the humbled Earth the Time of Grace,
Breathless be song,
The darkness, suddenly increased,
To the gray secret lingering in the East.


XIV 
‘If I Were Dead’ 

‘If I were dead, you'd sometimes say, Poor Child!’
The dear lips quiver'd as they spake,
And the tears brake
From eyes which, not to grieve me, brightly smiled.
Poor Child, poor Child!
I seem to hear your laugh, your talk, your song.
It is not true that Love will do no wrong.
Poor Child!
And did you think, when you so cried and smiled,
How I, in lonely nights, should lie awake,
And of those words your full avengers make?
Poor Child, poor Child!
And now, unless it be
That sweet amends thrice told are come to thee,
Poor Child!


XV 
Peace

how hast thou forgot,
In dullard care for undisturb'd increase
Of gold, which profits not,
The gain which once thou knew'st was for thy peace!
Honour is peace, the peace which does accord
‘My peace I send you, and I send a sword.’
O England, how hast thou forgot,
How fear'st the things which make for joy, not fear,
Confronted near.
Hard days? 'Tis what the pamper'd seek to buy
With their most willing gold in weary lands.
Loss and pain risk'd? What sport but understands
These for incitements! Suddenly to die,
With conscience a blurr'd scroll?
The sunshine dreaming upon Salmon's height
Is not so sweet and white
As the most heretofore sin-spotted soul
That darts to its delight
Straight from the absolution of a faithful fight.
Myriads of homes unloosen'd of home's bond,
And fill'd with helpless babes and harmless women fond?
Let those whose pleasant chance
Took them, like me, among the German towns,
After the war that pluck'd the fangs from France,
With me pronounce
Whether the frequent black, which then array'd
Child, wife, and maid,
Did most to magnify the sombreness of grief,
Or add the beauty of a staid relief 
And freshening foil
To cheerful-hearted Honour's ready smile!

Beneath the heroic sun
Is there then none
Whose sinewy wings by choice do fly
In the fine mountain-air of public obloquy,
To tell the sleepy mongers of false ease
That war's the ordained way of all alive,
And therein with goodwill to dare and thrive
Is profit and heart's peace?

But in his heart the fool now saith:
‘The thoughts of Heaven were past all finding out,
Indeed, if it should rain
Intolerable woes upon our Land again,
After so long a drought!’

‘Will a kind Providence our vessel whelm,
With such a pious Pilot at the helm?’

‘Or let the throats be cut of pretty sheep
That care for nought but pasture rich and deep?’

At people who hate Turks and Papists so?’

‘What, make or keep
A tax for ship and gun,
When 'tis full three to one
Yon bully but intends
To beat our friends?’

‘Let's put aside
Our costly pride.
Our appetite's not gone
Because we've learn'd to doff
Our caps, where we were used to keep them on.’

‘If times get worse,
We've money in our purse,
And Patriots that know how, let who will scoff,
To buy our perils off.
Yea, blessed in our midst 
Art thou who lately didst,
So cheap,
The old bargain of the Saxon with the Dane.’
Thus in his heart the fool now saith;
And, lo, our trusted leaders trust fool's luck,
Which, like the whale's 'mazed chine,
When they thereon were mulling of their wine,
Will some day duck.

Remnant of Honour, brooding in the dark
Over your bitter cark,
Staring, as Rispah stared, astonied seven days,
Upon the corpses of so many sons,
Who loved her once,
Dead in the dim and lion-haunted ways,
Who could have dreamt
That times should come like these!
Prophets, indeed, taught lies when we were young,
And people loved to have it so;
For they teach well who teach their scholars' tongue!
But that the foolish both should gaze,
With feeble, fascinated face,
Upon the wan crest of the coming woe,
The billow of earthquake underneath the seas,
And sit at ease,
Or stand agape,
Without so much as stepping back to 'scape,
Mumbling, ‘Perchance we perish if we stay:
'Tis certain wear of shoes to stir away!’
Who could have dreamt
That times should come like these!
Remnant of Honour, tongue-tied with contempt,
Consider; you are strong yet, if you please.
A hundred just men up, and arm'd but with a frown,
May hoot a hundred thousand false loons down,
Or drive them any way like geese. 
But to sit silent now is to suborn
The common villainy you scorn.
In the dark hour
When phrases are in power,
And nought's to choose between
The thing which is not and which is not seen,
One fool, with lusty lungs,
Does what a hundred wise, who hate and hold their tongues,
Shall ne'er undo.
In such an hour,
When eager hands are fetter'd and too few,
And hearts alone have leave to bleed,
Speak; for a good word then is a good deed.


XVI 
A Farewell

With all my will, but much against my heart,
We two now part.
My Very Dear,
Our solace is, the sad road lies so clear.
It needs no art,
With faint, averted feet
And many a tear,
In our opposed paths to persevere.
Go thou to East, I West.
We will not say
There's any hope, it is so far away.
But, O, my Best,
When the one darling of our widowhead,
The nursling Grief,
Is dead,
And no dews blur our eyes 
To see the peach-bloom come in evening skies,
Perchance we may,
Where now this night is day,
And even through faith of still averted feet,
Making full circle of our banishment,
Amazed meet;
The bitter journey to the bourne so sweet
Seasoning the termless feast of our content
With tears of recognition never dry.


XVII 
Stand by,
Ye Wise, by whom Heav'n rules!
Your kingly hands suit not the hangman's tools.
Are there no knaves and fools?
For ages yet to come your kind shall count for nought.
Smoke of the strife of other Powers
Than ours,
And tongues inscrutable with fury fraught
'Wilder the sky,
Till the far good which none can guess be wrought.
Stand by!
Since tears are vain, here let us rest and laugh,
But not too loudly; for the brave time's come,
When Best may not blaspheme the Bigger Half,
And freedom for our sort means freedom to be dumb.

Lo, how the dross and draff
Jeer up at us, and shout,
‘The Day is ours, the Night is theirs!’
And urge their rout 
Where the wild dawn of rising Tartarus flares.
Yon strives their Leader, lusting to be seen.
His leprosy's so perfect that men call him clean!
Listen the long, sincere, and liberal bray
Of the earnest Puller at another's hay
'Gainst aught that dares to tug the other way,
Quite void of fears
With all that noise of ruin round his ears!
Yonder the people cast their caps o'erhead,
And swear the threaten'd doom is ne'er to dread
That's come, though not yet past.
All front the horror and are none aghast;
Brag of their full-blown rights and liberties,
Nor once surmise
When each man gets his due the Nation dies;
Nay, still shout ‘Progress!’ as if seven plagues
Should take the laggard who would stretch his legs.
Forward! glad rush of Gergesenian swine;
You've gain'd the hill-top, but there's yet the brine.
Forward! to meet the welcome of the waves
That mount to 'whelm the freedom which enslaves.
Forward! bad corpses turn into good dung,
To feed strange futures beautiful and young.
And grant ye the Fool's true good, in abject ruin's gulf
As the Wise see him so to see himself!

Ah, Land once mine,
That seem'd to me too sweetly wise,
Too sternly fair for aught that dies,
Past is thy proud and pleasant state,
That recent date
When, strong and single, in thy sovereign heart,
The thrones of thinking, hearing, sight,
The cunning hand, the knotted thew
Of lesser powers that heave and hew,
And each the smallest beneficial part, 
And merest pore of breathing, beat,
Full and complete,
The great pulse of thy generous might,
Equal in inequality,
That soul of joy in low and high;
When not a churl but felt the Giant's heat,
Albeit he simply call'd it his,
Flush in his common labour with delight,
And not a village-Maiden's kiss
But was for this
More sweet,
And not a sorrow but did lightlier sigh,
And for its private self less greet,
The whilst that other so majestic self stood by!
Integrity so vast could well afford
To wear in working many a stain,
To pillory the cobbler vain
And license madness in a lord.
On that were all men well agreed;
And, if they did a thing,
Their strength was with them in their deed,
And from amongst them came the shout of a king!

But, once let traitor coward meet,
Not Heaven itself can keep its feet.
Come knave who said to dastard, ‘Lo,
‘The Deluge!’ which but needed ‘No!’
For all the Atlantic's threatening roar,
If men would bravely understand,
Is softly check'd for evermore
By a firm bar of sand.
But, dastard listening knave, who said,
‘'Twere juster were the Giant dead,
That so yon bawlers may not miss
To vote their own pot-belly'd bliss,’
All that is past!
We saw the slaying, and were not aghast. 
But ne'er a sun, on village Groom and Bride,
Albeit they guess not how it is,
At Easter or at Whitsuntide,
But shines less gay for this!


XVIII 
The Two Deserts

Not greatly moved with awe am I
To learn that we may spy
Five thousand firmaments beyond our own.
The best that's known
Of the heavenly bodies does them credit small.
View'd close, the Moon's fair ball
Is of ill objects worst,
A corpse in Night's highway, naked, fire-scarr'd, accurst;
And now they tell
That the Sun is plainly seen to boil and burst
Too horribly for hell.
So, judging from these two,
As we must do,
The Universe, outside our living Earth,
Was all conceiv'd in the Creator's mirth,
Forecasting at the time Man's spirit deep,
To make dirt cheap.
Put by the Telescope!
Better without it man may see,
Stretch'd awful in the hush'd midnight,
The ghost of his eternity.
Give me the nobler glass that swells to the eye
The things which near us lie,
Till Science rapturously hails,
In the minutest water-drop, 
A torment of innumerable tails.
These at the least do live.
But rather give
A mind not much to pry
Beyond our royal-fair estate
Betwixt these deserts blank of small and great.
Wonder and beauty our own courtiers are,
Pressing to catch our gaze,
And out of obvious ways
Ne'er wandering far.


XIX 
Crest And Gulf


Much woe that man befalls
Who does not run when sent, nor come when Heaven calls;
Not matters, in the end, to any one but him;
And he as soon
Shall map the other side of the Moon,
As trace what his own deed,
In the next chop of the chance gale, shall breed.
This he may know:
His good or evil seed
Is like to grow,
For its first harvest, quite to contraries:
The father wise
Has still the hare-brain'd brood;
'Gainst evil, ill example better works than good;
The poet, fanning his mild flight
At a most keen and arduous height,
Unveils the tender heavens to horny human eyes 
Amidst ingenious blasphemies.
Wouldst raise the poor, in Capuan luxury sunk?
Or spread Heav'n's partial gifts o'er all, like dew?
The Many's weedy growth withers the gracious Few!
Strange opposites, from those, again, shall rise.
Join, then, if thee it please, the bitter jest
Of mankind's progress; all its spectral race
Mere impotence of rest,
The heaving vain of life which cannot cease from self,
Crest altering still to gulf
And gulf to crest
In endless chace,
That leaves the tossing water anchor'd in its place!
Ah, well does he who does but stand aside,
Sans hope or fear,
And marks the crest and gulf in station sink and rear,
And prophesies 'gainst trust in such a tide:
For he sometimes is prophet, heavenly taught,
Whose message is that he sees only nought.

Nathless, discern'd may be,
By listeners at the doors of destiny,
The fly-wheel swift and still
Mighty to keep in bound, tho' powerless to quell,
The amorous and vehement drift of man's herd to hell.


XX 
‘Let Be!’ 

Ah, yes; we tell the good and evil trees
By fruits: But how tell these?
Who does not know
That good and ill
Are done in secret still,
And that which shews is verily but show!
How high of heart is one, and one how sweet of mood:
But not all height is holiness,
Nor every sweetness good;
And grace will sometimes lurk where who could guess?
The Critic of his kind,
Dealing to each his share,
With easy humour, hard to bear,
May not impossibly have in him shrined,
As in a gossamer globe or thickly padded pod,
Haply yon wretch, so famous for his falls,
Got them beneath the Devil-defended walls
Of some high Virtue he had vow'd to win;
And that which you and I
Call his besetting sin
Is but the fume of his peculiar fire
Of inmost contrary desire,
And means wild willingness for her to die,
Dash'd with despondence of her favour sweet;
He fiercer fighting, in his worst defeat,
Than I or you,
That only courteous greet
Where he does hotly woo,
Did ever fight, in our best victory. 
Another is mistook
Through his deceitful likeness to his look!
Let be, let be:
Why should I clear myself, why answer thou for me?
That shaft of slander shot
Miss'd only the right blot.
I see the shame
They cannot see:
'Tis very just they blame
The thing that's not.


XXI 
‘Faint Yet Pursuing’ 

Heroic Good, target for which the young
Dream in their dreams that every bow is strung,
And, missing, sigh
Unfruitful, or as disbelievers die,
Thee having miss'd, I will not so revolt,
But lowlier shoot my bolt,
And lowlier still, if still I may not reach,
And my proud stomach teach
That less than highest is good, and may be high.
An even walk in life's uneven way,
Though to have dreamt of flight and not to fly
Be strange and sad,
Is not a boon that's given to all who pray.
If this I had
I'd envy none!
Nay, trod I straight for one
Year, month or week,
Should Heaven withdraw, and Satan me amerce 
Of power and joy, still would I seek
Another victory with a like reverse;
Because the good of victory does not die,
As dies the failure's curse,
And what we have to gain
Is, not one battle, but a weary life's campaign.
Yet meaner lot being sent
Should more than me content;
Yea, if I lie
Among vile shards, though born for silver wings,
In the strong flight and feathers gold
Of whatsoever heavenward mounts and sings
I must by admiration so comply
That there I should my own delight behold.
Yea, though I sin each day times seven,
And dare not lift the fearfullest eyes to Heaven,
Thanks must I give
Because that seven times are not eight or nine,
And that my darkness is all mine,
And that I live
Within this oak-shade one more minute even,
Hearing the winds their Maker magnify.


XXII 
Victory In Defeat 

How soon it came to pass
The sweetness melted from thy barbed hook
Which I so simply took;
And I lay bleeding on the bitter land,
Afraid to stir against thy least command, 
But losing all my pleasant life-blood, whence
Force should have been heart's frailty to withstand.
Life is not life at all without delight,
Nor has it any might;
And better than the insentient heart and brain
Is sharpest pain;
And better for the moment seems it to rebel,
If the great Master, from his lifted seat,
Ne'er whispers to the wearied servant ‘Well!’
Yet what returns of love did I endure,
When to be pardon'd seem'd almost more sweet
Than aye to have been pure!
But day still faded to disastrous night,
And thicker darkness changed to feebler light,
Until forgiveness, without stint renew'd,
Was now no more with loving tears imbued,
Vowing no more offence.
Not less to thine Unfaithful didst thou cry,
‘Come back, poor Child; be all as 'twas before.
But I,
‘No, no; I will not promise any more!
Yet, when I feel my hour is come to die,
And so I am secured of continence,
Then may I say, though haply then in vain,
'My only, only Love, O, take me back again!'’

Thereafter didst thou smite
So hard that, for a space,
Uplifted seem'd Heav'n's everlasting door,
And I indeed the darling of thy grace.
But, in some dozen changes of the moon,
A bitter mockery seem'd thy bitter boon.
The broken pinion was no longer sore.
Again, indeed, I woke
Under so dread a stroke
That all the strength it left within my heart
Was just to ache and turn, and then to turn and ache, 
And some weak sign of war unceasingly to make.
And here I lie,
With no one near to mark,
Thrusting Hell's phantoms feebly in the dark,
And still at point more utterly to die.
Put forth indeed thy powerful right hand,
While time is yet,
Or never shall I see the blissful land!

(Which soon I shall forget):
‘The man who, though his fights be all defeats,
Still fights,
Enters at last
The heavenly Jerusalem's rejoicing streets
With glory more, and more triumphant rites
Than always-conquering Joshua's, when his blast
The frighted walls of Jericho down cast;
And, lo, the glad surprise
Of peace beyond surmise,
More than in common Saints, for ever in his eyes.


XXIII 
Remembered Grace

Since succour to the feeblest of the wise
Is charge of nobler weight
Than the security
Of many and many a foolish soul's estate,
This I affirm,
Though fools will fools more confidently be:
He does so till the end:
And having planted life's miraculous germ,
One sweet pulsation of responsive love,
He sets him sheer above,
Not sin and bitter shame
And wreck of fame,
But Hell's insidious and more black attempt,
The envy, malice, and pride,
Which men who share so easily condone
That few ev'n list such ills as these to hide.
From these unalterably exempt,
Through the remember'd grace
Of that divine embrace,
Of his sad errors none,
Though gross to blame,
Shall cast him lower than the cleansing flame,
Nor make him quite depart
And to themselves unknown.
Nor can he quail
In faith, nor flush nor pale
When all the other idiot people spell
How this or that new Prophet's word belies
Their last high oracle;
But constantly his soul
Points to its pole
Ev'n as the needle points, and knows not why;
And, under the ever-changing clouds of doubt,
When others cry,
‘The stars, if stars there were,
Are quench'd and out!’
To him, uplooking t'ward the hills for aid,
Appear, at need display'd,
Gaps in the low-hung gloom, and, bright in air,
Orion or the Bear.


XXIV 
Vesica Piscis

In strenuous hope I wrought,
And hope seem'd still betray'd;
Lastly I said,
‘I have labour'd through the Night, nor yet
Have taken aught;
But at Thy word I will again cast forth the net!’
And, lo, I caught
(Oh, quite unlike and quite beyond my thought,)
Not the quick, shining harvest of the Sea,
For food, my wish,
But Thee!
Then, hiding even in me,
As hid was Simon's coin within the fish,
Thou sigh'd'st, with joy, ‘Be dumb,
Or speak but of forgotten things to far-off times to come.’Never knew, that I'd come down to this arena
Zealously building this chemistry off this tsunami
Lovely so, that smile I have given myself to; 
Unwittingly so, owning this cheerful soul




Nothing is real, it's just an idea
Zigzagged In its twisted way, which I -
Learned through hard times to let go
Valentine of this bittersweet realm, something I never felt before
Unwillingly must have you known, it indeed seemed to be so real.  

When children are playing alone on the green, 
In comes the playmate that never was seen. 
When children are happy and lonely and good, 
The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood. 

Nobody heard him, and nobody saw, 
His is a picture you never could draw, 
But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home, 
When children are happy and playing alone. 

He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass, 
He sings when you tinkle the musical glass; 
Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why, 
The Friend of the Children is sure to be by! 

He loves to be little, he hates to be big, 
'T is he that inhabits the caves that you dig; 
'T is he when you play with your soldiers of tin 
That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win. 

'T is he, when at night you go off to your bed, 
Bids you go to sleep and not trouble your head; 
For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf, 
'T is he will take care of your playthings himself

I cry when you are in pain, 
Never let you fall sick, 
never made you wear dirty cloths, 
never let you starve for food, 
expecting nothing.  




THE UNTOLD FEELING of a WIFE.  

You once told me your race
(Not if I really cared)  
You once showed me the true color of your face
(Not if that mattered)  
You are whom you want to be
You are the sheep, you are the bee.

You once told me who you were
Once you discovered what the dean did
You called the police supervisor
And filed a report, there you hid
Your true genealogy
You wanted to be conveniently
Different than the jerk
Because there was no perk
For you to win
What an egregious sin
What a sad hypocrite
You are the pit
The pit bull that lies
And the other one, the cat
That steals the pies
You are no different than the bat
Who behaved like a wise crow 
At day time and at night time
Chased the house mouse like a deadly owl
I never knew you’d stoop so low
By perjuring yourself; you duly committed a crime
By lying; you are just like the scarecrow
The kleptomaniac, which filed the death certificate
To claim the benefits that no longer fit.



You once told me your race
(Not if I really cared)  
I just wanted the black ace
(Because that truly mattered)  
The white pearl, the black gold
The white gold and my story told. 

I crouch like a lion
Lurking for unsuspecting prey, 
Patience is the key: 
I’m willing to wait for eternity
For the tables to be turned, 
To come into my own, 
To taste the sweet wine
Of perfectly aged revenge-
Previously, I’ve filled my gullet
With humiliation, 
I’ve been submerged
In the sewer of defeat.

The day is coming
When I will laugh like a hyena 
And dance like a jackal
When I see those
Who organized
My supposed demise
Gazing at me like Lazarus
Risen from the dead! 
I’ll watch them gnash their teeth
On the hard words they hurled at me
When I was a clown
On freakish, circus streets
After I ascend
To the throne of power
Like a revolutionary
Leading a peasant revolt
Or a forgotten prince
Cutting the reigning king’s throat-

I will gain the upper hand
Before I smile in my grave. 



It must have been in March the rug wore through.
Now the day passes and I stare
At warped pine boards my father's father nailed,
At the twisted grain. Exposed, where emptiness allows,
Are the wormholes of eighty years; four generations' shoes
Stumble and scrape and fall
To the floor my father stained,
The new blood streaming from his head. The drift
Of autumn fires and a century's cigars, that gun's
Magnanimous and brutal smoke, endure.
In March the rug was ragged as the past. The thread
rots like the lives we fasten on. Now it is August,
And the floor is blank, worn smooth,
And, for my life, imperishable. 


The urge is here
The urge is near
The urge isn't really all that dear
It hurts to think
It really does stink
It hurts to cry
So, I just let out a little sigh
I finally cry
My tears are getting dry
I'm done getting high
This is not another lie
I'm ready to fly
High up in the sky



Mrs. Coley’s three-flat brick
Isn’t here any more.
All done with seeing her fat little form   
Burst out of the basement door;
And with seeing her African son-in-law   
(Rightful heir to the throne)
With his great white strong cold squares of teeth   
And his little eyes of stone;
And with seeing the squat fat daughter   
Letting in the men
When majesty has gone for the day—
And letting them out again. 

Once there was a man who filmed his vacation.
He went flying down the river in his boat
with his video camera to his eye, making
a moving picture of the moving river
upon which his sleek boat moved swiftly
toward the end of his vacation. He showed
his vacation to his camera, which pictured it,
preserving it forever: the river, the trees,
the sky, the light, the bow of his rushing boat
behind which he stood with his camera
preserving his vacation even as he was having it
so that after he had had it he would still
have it. It would be there. With a flick
of a switch, there it would be. But he
would not be in it. He would never be in it. 




Give to me the life I love,
Let the lave go by me,
Give the jolly heaven above
And the byway nigh me.
Bed in the bush with stars to see,
Bread I dip in the river -
There's the life for a man like me,
There's the life for ever.

Let the blow fall soon or late,
Let what will be o'er me;
Give the face of earth around
And the road before me.
Wealth I seek not, hope nor love,
Nor a friend to know me;
All I seek, the heaven above
And the road below me.

Or let autumn fall on me
Where afield I linger,
Silencing the bird on tree,
Biting the blue finger.
White as meal the frosty field -
Warm the fireside haven -
Not to autumn will I yield,
Not to winter even!

Let the blow fall soon or late,
Let what will be o'er me;
Give the face of earth around,
And the road before me.
Wealth I ask not, hope nor love,
Nor a friend to know me;
All I ask, the heaven above
And the road below me. 



What saw you in your flight to-day, 
Crows, awinging your homeward way? 

Went you far in carrion quest, 
Crows, that worry the sunless west? 

Thieves and villains, you shameless things! 
Black your record as black your wings. 

Tell me, birds of the inky hue, 
Plunderous rogues--to-day have you 

Seen with mischievous, prying eyes 
Lands where earlier suns arise? 

Saw you a lazy beck between 
Trees that shadow its breast in green, 

Teased by obstinate stones that lie 
Crossing the current tauntingly? 

Fields abloom on the farther side 
With purpling clover lying wide-- 

Saw you there as you circled by, 
Vale-environed a cottage lie, 

Girt about with emerald bands, 
Nestling down in its meadow lands? 

Saw you this on your thieving raids? 
Speak--you rascally renegades! 

Thieved you also away from me 
Olden scenes that I long to see? 

If, O! crows, you have flown since morn 
Over the place where I was born, 

Forget will I, how black you were 
Since dawn, in feather and character; 

Absolve will I, your vagrant band 
Ere you enter your slumberland. 




Once it smiled a silent dell
       Where the people did not dwell;
       They had gone unto the wars,
       Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
       Nightly, from their azure towers,
       To keep watch above the flowers,
       In the midst of which all day
       The red sunlight lazily lay.
       Now each visitor shall confess
       The sad valley's restlessness.
       Nothing there is motionless-
       Nothing save the airs that brood
       Over the magic solitude.
       Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
       That palpitate like the chill seas
       Around the misty Hebrides!
       Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
       That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
       Uneasily, from morn till even,
       Over the violets there that lie
       In myriad types of the human eye-
       Over the lilies there that wave
       And weep above a nameless grave!
       They wave:- from out their fragrant tops
       Eternal dews come down in drops.
       They weep:- from off their delicate stems
       Perennial tears descend in gems. 



You that, like a dagger’s thrust,
Have entered my complaining heart,
You that, stronger than a host
Of demons, came, wild yet prepared;

Within my mind’s humility
You made your bed and your domain;
- Infamous one who’s bound to me
Like any felon by his chain,

Like a gambler by his games,
Like the bottle and the sot,
Like the worms in one’s remains,
- Damm you! Damnation be your lot!

I’ve begged the merciful, swift sword
To overcome my liberty -
To poison I have said the word:
Save me from poltroonery.


Alas the sword! Alas the poison!
Contemptuous, they spoke to m:
"You never can deserve remission
Of your accursed slavery,


"Imbecile! - If our deadly empire
Freed you from your present fate,
Your kiss would soon resuscitate
The cold cadaver of your vampire!"I was walking down the river bank it was just the other night
When a vampire with a fishing rod gave me a real bad fright
'I haven't had a bite all day' it said and bared its drooling fangs
'A pint or two of your cool blood will cure my hunger pangs'
It chased me down the cemetary as silent as the grave
Where spooks and ghouls& zombies were i said 'bridgid man! be brave' 
The vampire leapt upon me, we tumbled and we fell
Headlong down a deep dark hole, which led right down to hell
In hell he chased the devil himself who yelled in the confusion, 
'Help me bridgid baby, or ill need a blood transfusion! ! 'He is said to have been the last Red man
In Action. And the Miller is said to have laughed--
If you like to call such a sound a laugh.
But he gave no one else a laugher's license.
For he turned suddenly grave as if to say,
'Whose business,--if I take it on myself,
Whose business--but why talk round the barn?--
When it's just that I hold with getting a thing done with.'
You can't get back and see it as he saw it.
It's too long a story to go into now.
You'd have to have been there and lived it.
They you wouldn't have looked on it as just a matter
Of who began it between the two races.


Some guttural exclamation of surprise
The Red man gave in poking about the mill
Over the great big thumping shuffling millstone
Disgusted the Miller physically as coming
From one who had no right to be heard from.
'Come, John,' he said, 'you want to see the wheel-pint?'


He took him down below a cramping rafter,
And showed him, through a manhole in the floor,
The water in desperate straits like frantic fish,
Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails.
The he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
That jangled even above the general noise,
And came upstairs alone--and gave that laugh,
And said something to a man with a meal-sack
That the man with the meal-sack didn't catch--then.
Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel-pit all right. 

As he said vanity, so vain say I,
Oh! Vanity, O vain all under sky;
Where is the man can say, "Lo, I have found
On brittle earth a consolation sound"?
What isn't in honor to be set on high?
No, they like beasts and sons of men shall die,
And whilst they live, how oft doth turn their fate;
He's now a captive that was king of late.
What isn't in wealth great treasures to obtain?
No, that's but labor, anxious care, and pain.
He heaps up riches, and he heaps up sorrow,
It's his today, but who's his heir tomorrow?
What then? Content in pleasures canst thou find?
More vain than all, that's but to grasp the wind.
The sensual senses for a time they pleasure,
Meanwhile the conscience rage, who shall appease?
What isn't in beauty? No that's but a snare,
They're foul enough today, that once were fair.
What is't in flow'ring youth, or manly age?
The first is prone to vice, the last to rage.
Where is it then, in wisdom, learning, arts?
Sure if on earth, it must be in those parts;
Yet these the wisest man of men did find
But vanity, vexation of the mind.
And he that know the most doth still bemoan
He knows not all that here is to be known.
What is it then? To do as stoics tell,
Nor laugh, nor weep, let things go ill or well?
Such stoics are but stocks, such teaching vain,
While man is man, he shall have ease or pain.
If not in honor, beauty, age, nor treasure,
Nor yet in learning, wisdom, youth, nor pleasure,
Where shall I climb, sound, seek, search, or find
That summum bonum which may stay my mind?
There is a path no vulture's eye hath seen,
Where lion fierce, nor lion's whelps have been,
Which leads unto that living crystal fount,
Who drinks thereof, the world doth naught account.
The depth and sea have said " 'tis not in me,"
With pearl and gold it shall not valued be.
For sapphire, onyx, topaz who would change;
It's hid from eyes of men, they count it strange.
Death and destruction the fame hath heard,
But where and what it is, from heaven's declared;
It brings to honor which shall ne'er decay,
It stores with wealth which time can't wear away.
It yieldeth pleasures far beyond conceit,
And truly beautifies without deceit.
Nor strength, nor wisdom, nor fresh youth shall fade,
Nor death shall see, but are immortal made.
This pearl of price, this tree of life, this spring,
Who is possessed of shall reign a king.
Nor change of state nor cares shall ever see,
But wear his crown unto eternity.
This satiates the soul, this stays the mind,
And all the rest, but vanity we find. 



Every generation passes
We struggle to live, to survive
To  think of life solely
Of its accessories, our comfort
And nothing else; 
Sometimes we go it like life itself
Will end never.
Why we live, how we live 
Matters not
Every thought life tops
How I am better than you
How I am richer than anyone else
Little thinking of the end 
Never knowing his tight rein is on Our necks
Until he drag us to our hole
We never will know 
If we lived and
Whatever we lived for, a vanity
No generation will learn. 

I HAVE left all upon the shameful field,
Spurless, with sword reversed and dinted shield,
Degraded and disgraced, I leave the strife.

From him that hath not, shall there not be taken
E'en that he hath, when he deserts the strife?
Life left by all life's benefits forsaken,


If tires of trees I seek again mankind, Well I know where to hie me--in the dawn, To a slope where the cattle keep the lawn. There amid loggin juniper reclined, Myself unseen, I see in white defined Far off the homes of men, and farther still, The graves of men on an opposing hill, Living or dead, whichever are to mind.  And if by noon I have too much of these, I have but to turn on my arm, and lo, The sun-burned hillside sets my face aglow, My breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, I smell the earth, I smell the bruised plant, I look into the crater of the ant. 



A youth, impelled by a burning thirst for knowledge
To roam to Sais, in fair Egypt's land,
The priesthood's secret learning to explore,
Had passed through many a grade with eager haste,
And still was hurrying on with fond impatience.
Scarce could the Hierophant impose a rein
Upon his headlong efforts. "What avails
A part without the whole?" the youth exclaimed;
"Can there be here a lesser or a greater?
The truth thou speak'st of, like mere earthly dross,
Is't but a sum that can be held by man
In larger or in smaller quantity?
Surely 'tis changeless, indivisible;
Deprive a harmony of but one note,
Deprive the rainbow of one single color,
And all that will remain is naught, so long
As that one color, that one note, is wanting



While thus they converse held, they chanced to stand
Within the precincts of a lonely temple,
Where a veiled statue of gigantic size
The youth's attention caught. In wonderment
He turned him toward his guide, and asked him, saying,
"What form is that concealed beneath yon veil?"
"Truth!" was the answer.  "What!" the young man cried,
"When I am striving after truth alone,
Seekest thou to hide that very truth from me?"

Replied the Hierophant.  "'Let no rash mortal
Disturb this veil,' said he, 'till raised by me;
For he who dares with sacrilegious hand
To move the sacred mystic covering,
"Strangely oracular, indeed!  And thou
Hast never ventured, then, to raise the veil?"
"I?  Truly not!  I never even felt
The least desire

"--"Is't possible?  If I
Were severed from the truth by nothing else
Than this thin gauze--"  "And a divine decree,"
His guide broke in.  "Far heavier than thou thinkest
Is this thin gauze, my son.  Light to thy hand
It may be--but most weighty to thy conscience


The youth now sought his home, absorbed in thought;
His burning wish to solve the mystery
Banished all sleep; upon his couch he lay,
Tossing his feverish limbs.  When midnight came,
He rose, and toward the temple timidly,
Led by a mighty impulse, bent his way.
The walls he scaled, and soon one active spring
Landed the daring boy beneath the dome.

Behold him now, in utter solitude,
Welcomed by naught save fearful, deathlike silence,--
A silence which the echo of his steps
Alone disturbs, as through the vaults he paces.
Piercing an opening in the cupola,
The moon cast down her pale and silvery beams,
And, awful as a present deity,
Glittering amid the darkness of the pile,
In its long veil concealed, the statue stands.

With hesitating step, he now draws near--
His impious hand would fain remove the veil--
Sudden a burning chill assails his bones
And then an unseen arm repulses him.
"Unhappy one, what wouldst thou do?"  Thus cries
A faithful voice within his trembling breast.
"Wouldst thou profanely violate the All-Holy?"
"'Tis true the oracle declared, 'Let none
Venture to raise the veil till raised by me.'
But did the oracle itself not add,
That he who did so would behold the truth?
Whate'er is hid behind, I'll raise the veil


And then he shouted: "Yes! I will behold it!"
"Behold it!"
Repeats in mocking tone the distant echo.

He speaks, and, with the word, lifts up the veil.
Would you inquire what form there met his eye?
I know not,--but, when day appeared, the priests
Found him extended senseless, pale as death,
Before the pedestal of Isis' statue.
What had been seen and heard by him when there
He never would disclose, but from that hour
His happiness in life had fled forever,
And his deep sorrow soon conducted him
To an untimely grave.  "Woe to that man,"
He warning said to every questioner,
"Woe to that man who wins the truth by guilt,
For truth so gained will ne'er reward its owner


"I am a vendor
Of some sort
These days I have 
Some very important
Articles to sell- sycophancy, ignorance
And prejudice
If you want to buy
Come to my country. 


Depending on where you are living, 
You can feel and see the seasonal change, 
Where the leaves are changing colors and dying.
Do not worry; most of them will be back next spring, 
Under a different light, that's normal, that's not strange.

The fall season is upon us, it is a time to reflect, 
On the beauty of Mother Nature, which is perfect.
She is always effervescent and spectacular in all seasons.
Change is good, that's why the Poets find some sorts of reasons, 
To glorify the style of Venus, and the smile of all women.

In some parts of the world, the seasons are not equally distributed, 
In terms of comfortable temperatures, beach and ski weathers, 
However, men and women find ways to appreciate the wonders
Of the Almighty. Enjoy all seasons and do not be intimidated, 
To collect the falling leaves, and the abandoned feathers. 


I was a toddler, 
When these morons 
Invaded our cities and towns, 
To spread death, fear and terror, 
In Jeremie, Haiti. 
The tyrants have disrupted our paradise 
Of yore, for life. 
These sharks have punctured our spleens and guts, 
And bloodied our beautiful coastline and shores. 
These vampires, these blood-suckers, 
These criminals, theses torturers 
Caught our babies with their bayonets, 
Under the pretext that they did not want to waste their bullets. 
How odious! How audacious, those filthy pests! 
Already, our world is infested. How dishonest! 
(This summer is the fiftieth anniversary 
Of these horrible crimes) . The streets became cemeteries. 
Our poor peasants are psychologically zombified. 
How sad, many of them are blinded by power and money. 
Our memories, victims of a sluggish pusillanimity, 
Are paralyzed. Countless are lost in the dungeon. 
A people, without memory, 
Will never reach victory. 
Half a century after this morbid destruction, 
Many of these criminals are enjoying their unearned peace; 
However, the victims never saw the veils of JUSTICE. 
What a shame! We cannot digest this madness, 
The world should not accept this painful sadness, 
Where myriads of our brave young men died for no reason. 
What a heart-wrenching anniversary! What a tragic season! 



A leader of first order said ‘yes, I  have  heard 
That  there are some  problems  in this locality 
But sorry to say   I  have  nothing  to do.
That  you  know  a second  order  leader takes  over  the area'.
Hearing   this  the second  leader  commented 
‘ what's  the matter, perhaps he may not  remember  well
A third  order  is the responsible for that
It is not so easy  to be leader! 
If it is not  possible , you  may  quit
'well! does not  he know? 
That  we, the leaders have  a limitation 
There  are some protocols
There  are so many levels  in our party
And we haven't  any  rights to cross that  boundaries.
But there is only one 
Who can solve  such problems, he is high command'
The third  order  leader interpreted his expertise  views.
Listen  leaders 
You  may demark the land's limitation 
By creating fences  
But remember  when  this fences will be extirpated
All the ingredients of fences will be gone to astray. 



Old soldier went to wars
Both home and abroad
He wore gusto in his heart
When he came home
Gallantry spoke from the medals
Hanging on his chest.
Our nation remembered him 
Only on the armer forces remembrance day
And paid him neglect for his pension.
All he garnered at youth
Began to yield to time
And the medals left his chest
Dangling on the wall
Soon old soldier is gone


To-day, across our fathers' graves,
  The astonished  years reveal
The remnant of that desperate host
  Which cleansed our East with steel.

Hail and farewell! We greet you here,
  With tears that none will scorn--
O Keepers of the House of old,
  Or ever we were born!

One service more we dare to ask--
  Pray for us, heroes, pray,
That when Fate lays on us our task
  We do not shame the Day



The veterinarian 
Is the only doctor that
Eats his patients
He devours chicken breast
And still visits to see 
Chickens in flu and puts
Some pills in water 
For them to heal.

The veterinarian
Is the only doctor that
Eats his patients
A cow has foot and mouth
And he is on hand to help
Still his freezer is full of fresh milk
And beef is the meat he eats
The veterinarian
Is the only doctor that
Eats his patients. 



Some one mentioned the 'Holocaust' the old Jewish man said 'no'
Such word i do not wish to hear that happened years ago
Then he slowly folded up his sleeve and numbers etched in blue
Told of the sufferings he'd known and all he had been through.

A silence fell o'er one and all across the club room floor
And in his presence 'Holocaust' not mentioned any more
We had amongst us in the flesh one who had lived through hell
But i wish that he could have spoke of sufferings he could tell.

Don't mention 'Holocaust' to me with one wave of his hand
A silence fell o'er one and all how could we understand? 
The agony he had been through, the torture and the pain
We did not mention 'Holocaust' no not to him again.

My heart went to that Jewish man who sought no sympathy
He wanted to block out his past as a bad memory
Don't mention 'Holocaust' to me and little else he said
But i could picture living soul whose thoughts were with the dead.

That night i did not sleep too well i had recurring dream
I watched the hungry slowly die, i heard the tortured scream
I saw a gray haired jewish man the sorrow on his face
And i was in another time a dark and a sadder place.

I woke and when i went to sleep the dream returned to me
Of Jewish man with tragic past who sought no sympathy
I see a young man in his prime with a hunger wasted frame
With numbers branded on his hand 'they'd robbed him of his name'.

Some one mentioned the 'Holocaust' the old jewish man said 'no'
Such word i do not wish to hear that happened years ago
Then he slowly folded up his sleeve and numbers etched in blue
Told of the sufferings he'd known and all he had been through. 

He has blossomed into be nobody's fool
The boy who was taunted and bullied at school
Quite a brilliant scientist and few of his kind
And his very equal would be hard to find.

The victim of bullying is well known and admired
And he works like one who is truly inspired
On environmental science he has a degree
And few indeed are as successful as he.

The quiet boy of the school he was rather quite shy
But to give of his best at his studies he always did try
And though the school bully boys he never did offend
Against their unprovoked physical attacks himself he could not defend.

With twin five year old daughters and a beautiful wife
His past he has put behind him and got on with his life
In his chosen field he did surely succeeed
And by good example he is one who does lead.

And the two boys who used to assault him as young men turned to crime
And for burglary and larceny they are now serving time
The karma we receive is the karma we are due
And those who laugh last laugh the loudest that sounds ever true. 



When Mother divorced you, we were glad. She took it and
took it in silence, all those years and then
kicked you out, suddenly, and her
kids loved it. Then you were fired, and we
grinned inside, the way people grinned when
Nixon's helicopter lifted off the South
Lawn for the last time. We were tickled
to think of your office taken away, 
your secretaries taken away, 
your lunches with three double bourbons, 
your pencils, your reams of paper. Would they take your
suits back, too, those dark
carcasses hung in your closet, and the black
noses of your shoes with their large pores? 
She had taught us to take it, to hate you and take it
until we pricked with her for your 
annihilation, Father. Now I
pass the bums in doorways, the white
slugs of their bodies gleaming through slits in their
suits of compressed silt, the stained
flippers of their hands, the underwater
fire of their eyes, ships gone down with the
lanterns lit, and I wonder who took it and 
took it from them in silence until they had
given it all away and had nothing 
left but this. 

We woke up one day
Wiped the smudges from our eyes, 
Saw the rising sun
This earth, part of our ancestral heritage
Started germinating frame works of iron
Far offshore and onshore
They looked like our stilted houses
Of wood they were not made
It was for our own good 
They told us.

Suddenly, vegetation began to give way
Streams and rivers began to wear
A thick blanket of liquid gold
The fish all came afloat with stink
The land gradually going.

Soon the pangs of hunger pierced
We rose up with our frail voices
And the multinationals hummed
Our brothers like lions roared
The land is gone, commandeered
We the owners are weaponized
Against ourselves, a ruse to harvest
What the land beholds within
A novelty discovery has metamorphosed
Into nuisance
And we are the victims. 



The view towards Cardinia from Glenpark drive
Where Nature's beauty still so much alive
And if a poet were here today I'm sure he'd write
Of green valley in late Autumn sunlight.

It's afternoon and almost half past one
And Cardinia lake glistening in the sun
Left to the imagination it would seem
A huge sheet of glass in sunlit valley green.

A flock of galahs calling in the sky
Performing their aerial acrobatics as they fly
A familiar sight though still a thing of joy
Their greys and pinks so pleasing to the eye.

From Glenpark drive on an afternoon in May
A mild and very pleasant Autumn day
The grass so green, the sunlit sky so blue
And the countryside so beautiful to view. 



England! where the sacred flame
Burns before the inmost shrine,
Where the lips that love thy name
Consecrate their hopes and thine,
Where the banners of thy dead
Weave their shadows overhead,
Watch beside thine arms to-night,

Think that when to-morrow comes
War shall claim command of all,
Thou must hear the roll of drums,
Thou must hear the trumpet's call.
Now, before thy silence ruth,
Commune with the voice of truth;
England! on thy knees to-night

Single-hearted, unafraid,
Hither all thy heroes came,
On this altar's steps were laid
Gordon's life and Outram's fame.
England! if thy will be yet
By their great example set,
Here beside thine arms to-night

So shalt thou when morning comes
Rise to conquer or to fall,
Joyful hear the rolling drums,
Joyful tear the trumpets call,
Then let Memory tell thy heart:
'England! what thou wert, thou art!'
Gird thee with thine ancient might,

Scarcely a street, too few houses
To merit the title; just a way between
The one tavern and the one shop
That leads nowhere and fails at the top
Of the short hill, eaten away
By long erosion of the green tide
Of grass creeping perpetually nearer 
This last outpost of time past.

So little happens; the black dog
Cracking his fleas in the hot sun
Is history.  Yet the girl who crosses
From door to door moves to a scale
Beyond the bland day's two dimensions.

Stay, then, village, for round you spins
On a slow axis a world as vast
And meaningful as any posed
By great Plato's solitary mind.




On the cheerful village green, 
Skirted round with houses small,
All the boys and girls are seen,
Playing there with hoop and ball. 

Now they frolic hand in hand,
Making many a merry chain; 
Then they form a warlike band,
Marching o'er the level plain. 

Now ascends the worsted ball, 
High it rises in the air, 
Or against the cottage wall, 
Up and down it bounces there. 

Then the hoop, with even pace, 
Runs before the merry throngs; 
Joy is seen in every face, 
Joy is heard in cheerful songs. 

Rich array, and mansions proud, 
Gilded toys, and costly fare, 
Would not make the little crowd
Half so happy as they are. 

Then, contented with my state, 
Where true pleasure may be seen, 
Let me envy not the great, 
On a cheerful village green. 



There is a Village idiot in every little town
A poor not too with it fellow for others to put down
Some people find it enjoyable to others to be cruel
A fair go for all to all never applies in a town where bullies rule
Pity the Village Idiot the small town's favourite put down boy
The mocking and the taunting of him the bullies do enjoy
Disrespect for the vulnerable begins at a young age
The local teenage bully never grows into a sage
In every small Town and Village a Village Idiot reside
Where the constant tauntings of bullies erodes his sense of pride
Most small town teenage bullies as bullies do remain
If not open to enlightenment insights they never gain
They find enjoyment in their cruelty at least that's how it does seem
And from the poor Village Idiot they strip all self esteem.




In these rapid, restless shadows,
    Once I walked at eventide,
  When a gentle, silent maiden,
    Walked in beauty at my side.
  She alone there walked beside me
  All in beauty, like a bride.
  Pallidly the moon was shining
    On the dewy meadows nigh;
  On the silvery, silent rivers,
    On the mountains far and high,--
  On the ocean's star-lit waters,
    Where the winds a-weary die.

  Slowly, silently we wandered
    From the open cottage door,
  Underneath the elm's long branches
    To the pavement bending o'er;
  Underneath the mossy willow
    And the dying sycamore.

  With the myriad stars in beauty
    All bedight, the heavens were seen,
  Radiant hopes were bright around me,
    Like the light of stars serene;
  Like the mellow midnight splendor

  Audibly the elm-leaves whispered
    Peaceful, pleasant melodies,
  Like the distant murmured music
    Of unquiet, lovely seas;
  While the winds were hushed in slumber
    In the fragrant flowers and trees.

  Wondrous and unwonted beauty
    Still adorning all did seem,
  While I told my love in fables
    'Neath the willows by the stream;
  Would the heart have kept unspoken
    Love that was its rarest dream!

  Instantly away we wandered
    In the shadowy twilight tide,
  She, the silent, scornful maiden,
    Walking calmly at my side,
  With a step serene and stately,
    All in beauty, all in pride.

  Vacantly I walked beside her.
    On the earth mine eyes were cast;
  Swift and keen there came unto me
    Bitter memories of the past--
  On me, like the rain in Autumn
    On the dead leaves, cold and fast.

  Underneath the elms we parted,
    By the lowly cottage door;
  One brief word alone was uttered--
    Never on our lips before;
  And away I walked forlornly,
  Broken-hearted evermore.

  Slowly, silently I loitered,
    Homeward, in the night, alone;
  Sudden anguish bound my spirit,
    That my youth had never known;
  Wild unrest, like that which cometh
    When the Night's first dream hath flown.

  Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
    Mad, discordant melodies,
  And keen melodies like shadows
    Haunt the moaning willow trees,
  And the sycamores with laughter
    Mock me in the nightly breeze.

  Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
    Through the sighing foliage streams;
  And each morning, midnight shadow,
    Shadow of my sorrow seems;
  Strive, O heart, forget thine idol!
    And, O soul, forget thy dreams



Half walls rendered aground 
by the honed edges of penury
And the village folk stampede and struggle
in the ruins
The old tin sheets hung up 
beaten rusty by the elements 
Children half clad and naked
their bodies smeared in gray granules
of dust
And the reeks of poverty rise and fall
upon the shoulders unable to respond
There's palm wine
There's local gin
And these are delibitating drinks
Between the absent meals
The road is lost to weeds
And shrubs and grasses kiss
In the middle of the road.
Those who run errands drink dews
From the bleeding leaves
And their shins bathed in dews
Perhaps the only one in a lifetime. 


The wild grape mantling the trail and tree, 
Festoons in graceful veils its drapery, 
Its tendrils cling, as clings the memory stirred 
By some evasive haunting tune, twice heard. 

Like clustering tents upon the embattled mead,
See Vitis thick her small pavilions spread.
Beneath each silken veil, with studious care
Five amorous brothers woo one yielding fair;
From the sweet raptures of the fond embrace,
Soon springs a lovely and a generous race:
In purple bright, or lucid verdure clad,
The passer's eye the groups luxuriant glad;

While o'er the enchanting clusters' native hue,
Spreads a rich tincture of celestial blue.
Sweet to the taste, the swelling orbs produce
A rich profusion of ambrosial juice;
Mantling and clear, man sees the beverage shine,
And hails with grateful voice the Power of Wine.
Fair and delicious boon of favouring Heaven,
To human kind the balm of sorrow given!
By this inspir'd, behold on blither wing
Soar the young Joys, the Muses sweeter sing;
With lighter step the dancing Graces move,
And fiercer burns the golden lamp of love.
But, thoughtless man! beware of foul excess,
Nor draw a curse where Heaven design'd to bless.
Then flies the genial draught that cheer'd the soul,
And fatal poison drugs the intemperate bowl;
Amid the flowrets of the festal wreath,
The serpents writhe of anguish and of death,
Shoots pale disease along the languid frame,
And passion's burning fiends the veins inflame. 


Have you heard the voice of flowers? 
Oh, they speak in many ways
Some will whisper, some will shout, 
Listen what they say

Flowers picked in tears, 
say goodbye to those in death
In baskets either blue or pink, 
they welcome baby's breath
Those picked in a hurry
beg forgiveness for a sin.
Chosen ones pressed in a book
reminds the heart where one has been.

The shouting out with dignity
is a flower that stays chaste
Her thorns, she sharpens daily, 
that imposters keep their place

Gardenias thank the mothers
while roses thank the wives
Many come to the maidens
as a pleading for a bride



Exchange in greed the ungraceful signs. Thrust
The thick notes between green apple breasts.
Then the shadow of the devil descends,
The violent space cries and angel eyes,
Large and dark, retreat in innocence and in ice. 
(Run sister run—the Bugga man comes!)

The violent space cries silently,
Like you cried wide years ago
In another space, speckled by the sun
And the leaves of a green plum tree,
And you were stung
By a red wasp and we flew home.
(Run sister run—the Bugga man comes!)

Well, hell, lil sis, wasps still sting.
You are all of seventeen and as alone now
In your pain as you were with the sting
On your brow.
Well, shit. lil sis, here we are:
You and I and this poem. 
And what should I do? should I squat
In the dust and make strange markings on the ground?
Shall I chant a spell to drive the demon away?
(Run sister run—the Bugga man comes!)

In the beginning you were the Virgin Mary,
And you are the Virgin Mary now.
But somewhere between Nazareth and Bethlehem
You lost your name in the nameless void.
'O Mary don't you weep don't you moan'
(Run sister run—the Bugga man comes!)

And what do I do. I boil my tears in a twisted spoon
And dance like an angel on the point of a needle. 
I sit counting syllables like Midas gold.
I am not bold. I cannot yet take hold of the demon
And lift his weight from you black belly,
So I grab the air and sing my song.
(But the air cannot stand my singing long.)



Down in a green and shady bed, 
A modest violet grew; 
Its stalk was bent, it hung its head
As if to hide from view. 
And yet it was a lovely flower, 
Its colour bright and fair; 
It might have graced a rosy bower, 
Instead of hiding there. 

Yet thus it was content to bloom, 
In modest tints arrayed; 
And there diffused a sweet perfume, 
Within the silent shade. 

Then let me to the valley go
This pretty flower to see; 
That I may also learn to grow
In sweet humility. 



The violet in her greenwood bower,
Where birchen boughs with hazel mingle,
May boast itself the fairest flower
In glen, or copse, or forest dingle.

Though fair her gems of azure hue,
Beneath the dew-drop's weight reclining;
I've seen an eye of lovelier blue,
More sweet through wat'ry lustre shining.

The summer sun that dew shall dry,
Ere yet the day be past its morrow;
No longer in my false love's eye
Remain'd the tear of parting sorrow. 

Dormi, Jesu! Mater ridet
Quae tam dulcem somnum videt,
Dormi, Jesu! blandule!
Si non dormis, Mater plorat,
Inter fila cantans orat,
Blande, veni, somnule.




ENGLISH.

Sleep, sweet babe! my cares beguiling:
Mother sits beside thee smiling;
Sleep, my darling, tenderly!
If thou sleep not, mother mourneth,
Singing as her wheel she turneth:
Come, soft slumber, balmily



Try as he will, no man breaks wholly loose
  From his first love, no matter who she be.
Oh, was there ever sailor free to choose,
  That didn't settle somewhere near the sea?

Myself, it don't excite me nor amuse
  To watch a pack o' shipping on the sea;
But I can understand my neighbour's views
  From certain things which have occured to me.

Men must keep touch with things they used to use
  To earn their living, even when they are free;
And so come back upon the least excuse --
  Same as the sailor settled near the sea.

He knows he's never going on no cruise --
  He knows he's done and finished with the sea;
And yet he likes to feel she's there to use --
  If he should ask her -- as she used to be.

Even though she cost him all he had to lose,
  Even though she made him sick to hear or see,
Still, what she left of him will mostly choose
  Her skirts to sit by. How comes such to be?

Parsons in pulpits, tax-payers in pews,
  Kings on your thrones, you know as well as me,
We've only one virginity to lose,
  And where we lost it there our hearts will be

Man of virtue has need; -into life with boldness he plunges,
 Entering with fortune more sure into the hazardous strife; 
But to woman one virtue suffices; it is ever shining
 Lovingly forth to the heart; so let it shine to the eye





Introduction.

I.
Lives there a strain, whose sounds of mounting fire
May rise distinguished o'er the din of war;
Or died it with yon Master of the Lyre
Who sung beleaguered Ilion's evil star?
Such, WELLINGTON, might reach thee from afar,
Wafting its descant wide o'er Ocean's range;
Nor shouts, nor clashing arms, its mood could mar,
All, as it swelled 'twixt each loud trumpet-change,
That clangs to Britain victory, to Portugal revenge!

II.
Yes! such a strain, with all o'er-pouring measure,
Might melodise with each tumultuous sound
Each voice of fear or triumph, woe or pleasure,
That rings Mondego's ravaged shores around;
The thundering cry of hosts with conquest crowned,
The female shriek, the ruined peasant's moan,
The shout of captives from their chains unbound,
The foiled oppressor's deep and sullen groan,
A Nation's choral hymn, for tyranny o'erthrown.

III.
But we, weak minstrels of a laggard day
Skilled but to imitate an elder page,
Timid and raptureless, can we repay
The debt thou claim'st in this exhausted age?
Thou givest our lyres a theme, that might engage
Those that could send thy name o'er sea and land,
While sea and land shall last; for Homer's rage
A theme; a theme for Milton's mighty hand -
How much unmeet for us, a faint degenerate band!

IV.
Ye mountains stern! within whose rugged breast
The friends of Scottish freedom found repose;
Ye torrents! whose hoarse sounds have soothed their rest,
Returning from the field of vanquished foes;
Say, have ye lost each wild majestic close
That erst the choir of Bards or Druids flung,
What time their hymn of victory arose,
And Cattraeth's glens with voice of triumph rung,
And mystic Merlin harped, and grey-haired Llywarch sung?

V.
Oh! if your wilds such minstrelsy retain,
As sure your changeful gales seem oft to say,
When sweeping wild and sinking soft again,
Like trumpet-jubilee, or harp's wild sway;
If ye can echo such triumphant lay,
Then lend the note to him has loved you long!
Who pious gathered each tradition grey
That floats your solitary wastes along,
And with affection vain gave them new voice in song.

VI.
For not till now, how oft soe'er the task
Of truant verse hath lightened graver care,
From Muse or Sylvan was he wont to ask,
In phrase poetic, inspiration fair;
Careless he gave his numbers to the air,
They came unsought for, if applauses came:
Nor for himself prefers he now the prayer;
Let but his verse befit a hero's fame,
Immortal be the verse!-forgot the poet's name!

VII.
Hark, from yon misty cairn their answer tost:
'Minstrel! the fame of whose romantic lyre,
Capricious-swelling now, may soon be lost,
Like the light flickering of a cottage fire;
If to such task presumptuous thou aspire,
Seek not from us the meed to warrior due:
Age after age has gathered son to sire
Since our grey cliffs the din of conflict knew,
Or, pealing through our vales, victorious bugles blew.

VIII.
'Decayed our old traditionary lore,
Save where the lingering fays renew their ring,
By milkmaid seen beneath the hawthorn hoar,
Or round the marge of Minchmore's haunted spring;
Save where their legends grey-haired shepherds sing,
That now scarce win a listening ear but thine,
Of feuds obscure, and Border ravaging,
And rugged deeds recount in rugged line,
Of moonlight foray made on Teviot, Tweed, or Tyne.

IX.
'No! search romantic lands, where the near Sun
Gives with unstinted boon ethereal flame,
Where the rude villager, his labour done,
In verse spontaneous chants some favoured name,
Whether Olalia's charms his tribute claim,
Her eye of diamond, and her locks of jet;
Or whether, kindling at the deeds of Graeme,
He sing, to wild Morisco measure set,
Old Albin's red claymore, green Erin's bayonet!

X.
'Explore those regions, where the flinty crest
Of wild Nevada ever gleams with snows,
Where in the proud Alhambra's ruined breast
Barbaric monuments of pomp repose;
Or where the banners of more ruthless foes
Than the fierce Moor, float o'er Toledo's fane,
From whose tall towers even now the patriot throws
An anxious glance, to spy upon the plain
The blended ranks of England, Portugal, and Spain.

XI.
'There, of Numantian fire a swarthy spark
Still lightens in the sunburnt native's eye;
The stately port, slow step, and visage dark,
Still mark enduring pride and constancy.
And, if the glow of feudal chivalry
Beam not, as once, thy nobles' dearest pride,
Iberia! oft thy crestless peasantry
Have seen the plumed Hidalgo quit their side,
Have seen, yet dauntless stood-'gainst fortune fought and died.

XII.
'And cherished still by that unchanging race,
Are themes for minstrelsy more high than thine;
Of strange tradition many a mystic trace,
Legend and vision, prophecy and sign;
Where wonders wild of Arabesque combine
With Gothic imagery of darker shade,
Forming a model meet for minstrel line.
Go, seek such theme!'-the Mountain Spirit said.
With filial awe I heard-I heard, and I obeyed.



The Vision of Don Roderick

I.
Rearing their crests amid the cloudless skies,
And darkly clustering in the pale moonlight,
Toledo's holy towers and spires arise,
As from a trembling lake of silver white.
Their mingled shadows intercept the sight
Of the broad burial-ground outstretched below,
And nought disturbs the silence of the night;
All sleeps in sullen shade, or silver glow,
All save the heavy swell of Teio's ceaseless flow.

II.
All save the rushing swell of Teio's tide,
Or, distant heard, a courser's neigh or tramp;
Their changing rounds as watchful horsemen ride,
To guard the limits of King Roderick's camp.
For through the river's night-fog rolling damp
Was many a proud pavilion dimly seen,
Which glimmered back, against the moon's fair lamp,
Tissues of silk and silver twisted sheen,
And standards proudly pitched, and warders armed between.

III.
But of their Monarch's person keeping ward,
Since last the deep-mouthed bell of vespers tolled,
The chosen soldiers of the royal guard
The post beneath the proud Cathedral hold:
A band unlike their Gothic sires of old,
Who, for the cap of steel and iron mace,
Bear slender darts, and casques bedecked with gold,
While silver-studded belts their shoulders grace,
Where ivory quivers ring in the broad falchion's place.

IV.
In the light language of an idle court,
They murmured at their master's long delay,
And held his lengthened orisons in sport:-
'What! will Don Roderick here till morning stay,
To wear in shrift and prayer the night away?
And are his hours in such dull penance past,
For fair Florinda's plundered charms to pay?'
Then to the east their weary eyes they cast,
And wished the lingering dawn would glimmer forth at last.

V.

But, far within, Toledo's Prelate lent
An ear of fearful wonder to the King;
The silver lamp a fitful lustre sent,
So long that sad confession witnessing:
For Roderick told of many a hidden thing,
Such as are lothly uttered to the air,
When Fear, Remorse, and Shame the bosom wring,
And Guilt his secret burden cannot bear,
And Conscience seeks in speech a respite from Despair.

VI.
Full on the Prelate's face, and silver hair,
The stream of failing light was feebly rolled:
But Roderick's visage, though his head was bare,
Was shadowed by his hand and mantle's fold.
While of his hidden soul the sins he told,
Proud Alaric's descendant could not brook,
That mortal man his bearing should behold,
Or boast that he had seen, when Conscience shook,
Fear tame a monarch's brow, Remorse a warrior's look.

VII.
The old man's faded cheek waxed yet more pale,
As many a secret sad the King bewrayed;
As sign and glance eked out the unfinished tale,
When in the midst his faltering whisper stayed.
'Thus royal Witiza was slain,'-he said;
'Yet, holy Father, deem not it was I.'
Thus still Ambition strives her crimes to shade. -
'Oh, rather deem 'twas stern necessity!
Self-preservation bade, and I must kill or die.

VIII.
'And if Florinda's shrieks alarmed the air,
If she invoked her absent sire in vain,
And on her knees implored that I would spare,
Yet, reverend Priest, thy sentence rash refrain!
All is not as it seems-the female train
Know by their bearing to disguise their mood:'
But Conscience here, as if in high disdain,
Sent to the Monarch's cheek the burning blood -
He stayed his speech abrupt-and up the Prelate stood.

IX.
'O hardened offspring of an iron race!
What of thy crimes, Don Roderick, shall I say?
What alms, or prayers, or penance can efface
Murder's dark spot, wash treason's stain away!
For the foul ravisher how shall I pray,
Who, scarce repentant, makes his crime his boast?
How hope Almighty vengeance shall delay,
He spare the shepherd, lest the guiltless sheep be lost?'

X.
Then kindled the dark tyrant in his mood,
And to his brow returned its dauntless gloom;
'And welcome then,' he cried, 'be blood for blood,
For treason treachery, for dishonour doom!
Yet will I know whence come they, or by whom.
Show, for thou canst-give forth the fated key,
And guide me, Priest, to that mysterious room,
Where, if aught true in old tradition be,
His nation's future fates a Spanish King shall see.'

XI.
'Ill-fated Prince! recall the desperate word,
Or pause ere yet the omen thou obey!
Bethink, yon spell-bound portal would afford
Never to former Monarch entrance-way;
Nor shall it ever ope, old records say,
Save to a King, the last of all his line,
What time his empire totters to decay,
And treason digs, beneath, her fatal mine,
And, high above, impends avenging wrath divine.' -

XII.
'Prelate! a Monarch's fate brooks no delay;
Lead on!'-The ponderous key the old man took,
And held the winking lamp, and led the way,
By winding stair, dark aisle, and secret nook,
Then on an ancient gateway bent his look;
And, as the key the desperate King essayed,
Low muttered thunders the Cathedral shook,
And twice he stopped, and twice new effort made,
Till the huge bolts rolled back, and the loud hinges brayed.

XIII.
Long, large, and lofty was that vaulted hall;
Roof, walls, and floor were all of marble stone,
Of polished marble, black as funeral pall,
Carved o'er with signs and characters unknown.
A paly light, as of the dawning, shone
Through the sad bounds, but whence they could not spy;
For window to the upper air was none;
Yet, by that light, Don Roderick could descry
Wonders that ne'er till then were seen by mortal eye.

XIV.
Grim sentinels, against the upper wall,
Of molten bronze, two Statues held their place;
Massive their naked limbs, their stature tall,
Their frowning foreheads golden circles grace.
Moulded they seemed for kings of giant race,
That lived and sinned before the avenging flood;
This grasped a scythe, that rested on a mace;
This spread his wings for flight, that pondering stood,
Each stubborn seemed and stern, immutable of mood.

XV.
Fixed was the right-hand Giant's brazen look
Upon his brother's glass of shifting sand,
As if its ebb he measured by a book,
Whose iron volume loaded his huge hand;
In which was wrote of many a fallen land
Of empires lost, and kings to exile driven:
And o'er that pair their names in scroll expand -
'Lo, DESTINY and TIME! to whom by Heaven
The guidance of the earth is for a season given.' -

XVI.
Even while they read, the sand-glass wastes away;
And, as the last and lagging grains did creep,
That right-hand Giant 'gan his club upsway,
As one that startles from a heavy sleep.
Full on the upper wall the mace's sweep
At once descended with the force of thunder,
And hurtling down at once, in crumbled heap,
The marble boundary was rent asunder,
And gave to Roderick's view new sights of fear and wonder.

XVII.
For they might spy, beyond that mighty breach,
Realms as of Spain in visioned prospect laid,
Castles and towers, in due proportion each,
As by some skilful artist's hand portrayed:
Here, crossed by many a wild Sierra's shade,
And boundless plains that tire the traveller's eye;
There, rich with vineyard and with olive glade,
Or deep-embrowned by forests huge and high,
Or washed by mighty streams, that slowly murmured by.

XVIII.
And here, as erst upon the antique stage
Passed forth the band of masquers trimly led,
In various forms, and various equipage,
While fitting strains the hearer's fancy fed;
So, to sad Roderick's eye in order spread,
Successive pageants filled that mystic scene,
Showing the fate of battles ere they bled,
And issue of events that had not been;
And, ever and anon, strange sounds were heard between.

XIX.
First shrilled an unrepeated female shriek! -
It seemed as if Don Roderick knew the call,
For the bold blood was blanching in his cheek. -
Then answered kettle-drum and attabal,
Gong-peal and cymbal-clank the ear appal,
The Tecbir war-cry, and the Lelie's yell,
Ring wildly dissonant along the hall.
Needs not to Roderick their dread import tell -
'The Moor!' he cried, 'the Moor!-ring out the Tocsin bell!

XX.
'They come! they come! I see the groaning lands
White with the turbans of each Arab horde;
Swart Zaarah joins her misbelieving bands,
Alla and Mahomet their battle-word,
The choice they yield, the Koran or the Sword -
In yonder shout the voice of conflict roared,
The shadowy hosts are closing on the plain -

XXI.
Their coward leader gives for flight the sign!
The sceptred craven mounts to quit the field -
Is not yon steed Orelio?-Yes, 'tis mine!
But never was she turned from battle-line:
Lo! where the recreant spurs o'er stock and stone! -
Curses pursue the slave, and wrath divine!
Rivers ingulph him!'-'Hush,' in shuddering tone,
The Prelate said; 'rash Prince, yon visioned form's thine own.'

XXII.
Just then, a torrent crossed the flier's course;
The dangerous ford the Kingly Likeness tried;
But the deep eddies whelmed both man and horse,
Swept like benighted peasant down the tide;
And the proud Moslemah spread far and wide,
As numerous as their native locust band;
Berber and Ismael's sons the spoils divide,
With naked scimitars mete out the land,
And for the bondsmen base the free-born natives brand.

XXIII.
Then rose the grated Harem, to enclose
Then, menials, to their misbelieving foes,
Castile's young nobles held forbidden wine;
Then, too, the holy Cross, salvation's sign,
By impious hands was from the altar thrown,
And the deep aisles of the polluted shrine
Echoed, for holy hymn and organ-tone,
The Santon's frantic dance, the Fakir's gibbering moan.

XXIV.
How fares Don Roderick?-E'en as one who spies
Flames dart their glare o'er midnight's sable woof,
And hears around his children's piercing cries,
And sees the pale assistants stand aloof;
While cruel Conscience brings him bitter proof,
His folly, or his crime, have caused his grief;
And while above him nods the crumbling roof,
He curses earth and Heaven-himself in chief -
Desperate of earthly aid, despairing Heaven's relief!

XXV.
That scythe-armed Giant turned his fatal glass
And twilight on the landscape closed her wings;
Far to Asturian hills the war-sounds pass,
And in their stead rebeck or timbrel rings;
And to the sound the bell-decked dancer springs,
Bazars resound as when their marts are met,
In tourney light the Moor his jerrid flings,
And on the land as evening seemed to set,
The Imaum's chant was heard from mosque or minaret.

XXVI.
So passed that pageant. Ere another came,
The visionary scene was wrapped in smoke
Whose sulph'rous wreaths were crossed by sheets of flame;
With every flash a bolt explosive broke,
Till Roderick deemed the fiends had burst their yoke,
And waved 'gainst heaven the infernal gonfalone!
For War a new and dreadful language spoke,
Never by ancient warrior heard or known;
Lightning and smoke her breath, and thunder was her tone.

XXVII.
From the dim landscape rolled the clouds away -
Before the Cross has waned the Crescent's ray,
And many a monastery decks the stage,
And lofty church, and low-browed hermitage.
The land obeys a Hermit and a Knight, -
The Genii those of Spain for many an age;
This clad in sackcloth, that in armour bright,
And that was VALOUR named, this BIGOTRY was hight.

XXVIII.
VALOUR was harnessed like a chief of old,
Armed at all points, and prompt for knightly gest;
His sword was tempered in the Ebro cold,
Morena's eagle plume adorned his crest,
The spoils of Afric's lion bound his breast.
Fierce he stepped forward and flung down his gage;
As if of mortal kind to brave the best.
Him followed his Companion, dark and sage,
As he, my Master, sung the dangerous Archimage.

XXIX.
Haughty of heart and brow the Warrior came,
In look and language proud as proud might be,
Vaunting his lordship, lineage, fights, and fame:
Yet was that barefoot Monk more proud than he:
And as the ivy climbs the tallest tree,
So round the loftiest soul his toils he wound,
And with his spells subdued the fierce and free,
Till ermined Age and Youth in arms renowned,
Honouring his scourge and haircloth, meekly kissed the ground.

XXX.
And thus it chanced that VALOUR, peerless knight,
Who ne'er to King or Kaiser vailed his crest,
Victorious still in bull-feast or in fight,
Since first his limbs with mail he did invest,
Stooped ever to that Anchoret's behest;
Nor reasoned of the right, nor of the wrong,
But at his bidding laid the lance in rest,
And wrought fell deeds the troubled world along,
For he was fierce as brave, and pitiless as strong.

XXXI.
Oft his proud galleys sought some new-found world,
That latest sees the sun, or first the morn;
Still at that Wizard's feet their spoils he hurled, -
Ingots of ore from rich Potosi borne,
Crowns by Caciques, aigrettes by Omrahs worn,
Wrought of rare gems, but broken, rent, and foul;
Idols of gold from heathen temples torn,
Bedabbled all with blood.-With grisly scowl
The Hermit marked the stains, and smiled beneath his cowl.

XXXII.
Then did he bless the offering, and bade make
Tribute to Heaven of gratitude and praise;
And at his word the choral hymns awake,
And many a hand the silver censer sways,
But with the incense-breath these censers raise,
Mix steams from corpses smouldering in the fire;
The groans of prisoned victims mar the lays,
And shrieks of agony confound the quire;
While, 'mid the mingled sounds, the darkened scenes expire.

XXXIII.
Preluding light, were strains of music heard,
As once again revolved that measured sand;
Such sounds as when, for silvan dance prepared,
Gay Xeres summons forth her vintage band;
When for the light bolero ready stand
The mozo blithe, with gay muchacha met,
He conscious of his broidered cap and band,
She of her netted locks and light corsette,
Each tiptoe perched to spring, and shake the castanet.

XXXIV.
And well such strains the opening scene became;
For VALOUR had relaxed his ardent look,
And at a lady's feet, like lion tame,
Lay stretched, full loath the weight of arms to brook;
And softened BIGOTRY, upon his book,
Pattered a task of little good or ill:
But the blithe peasant plied his pruning-hook,
Whistled the muleteer o'er vale and hill,
And rung from village-green the merry seguidille.

XXXV.
Grey Royalty, grown impotent of toil,
Let the grave sceptre slip his lazy hold;
And, careless, saw his rule become the spoil
Of a loose Female and her minion bold.
But peace was on the cottage and the fold,
From Court intrigue, from bickering faction far;
Beneath the chestnut-tree Love's tale was told,
And to the tinkling of the light guitar,
Sweet stooped the western sun, sweet rose the evening star.

XXXVI.
As that sea-cloud, in size like human hand,
When first from Carmel by the Tishbite seen,
Came slowly overshadowing Israel's land,
A while, perchance, bedecked with colours sheen,
While yet the sunbeams on its skirts had been,
Limning with purple and with gold its shroud,
Till darker folds obscured the blue serene
And blotted heaven with one broad sable cloud,
Then sheeted rain burst down, and whirlwinds howled aloud:-

XXXVII.
Even so, upon that peaceful scene was poured,
Like gathering clouds, full many a foreign band,
And HE, their Leader, wore in sheath his sword,
And offered peaceful front and open hand,
Veiling the perjured treachery he planned,
By friendship's zeal and honour's specious guise,
Until he won the passes of the land;
Then burst were honour's oath and friendship's ties!
He clutched his vulture grasp, and called fair Spain his prize.

XXXVIII.
An iron crown his anxious forehead bore;
And well such diadem his heart became,
Who ne'er his purpose for remorse gave o'er,
Or checked his course for piety or shame;
Who, trained a soldier, deemed a soldier's fame
Might flourish in the wreath of battles won,
Though neither truth nor honour decked his name;
Who, placed by fortune on a Monarch's throne,
Recked not of Monarch's faith, or Mercy's kingly tone.

XXXIX.
From a rude isle his ruder lineage came,
The spark, that, from a suburb-hovel's hearth
Ascending, wraps some capital in flame,
Hath not a meaner or more sordid birth.
And for the soul that bade him waste the earth -
The sable land-flood from some swamp obscure
That poisons the glad husband-field with dearth,
And by destruction bids its fame endure,
Hath not a source more sullen, stagnant, and impure.

XL.
Before that Leader strode a shadowy Form;
Her limbs like mist, her torch like meteor showed,
With which she beckoned him through fight and storm,
And all he crushed that crossed his desperate road,
Nor thought, nor feared, nor looked on what he trode.
Realms could not glut his pride, blood could not slake,
So oft as e'er she shook her torch abroad -
It was AMBITION bade her terrors wake,
Nor deigned she, as of yore, a milder form to take.

XLI.
No longer now she spurned at mean revenge,
Or stayed her hand for conquered foeman's moan;
As when, the fates of aged Rome to change,
By Caesar's side she crossed the Rubicon.
Nor joyed she to bestow the spoils she won,
As when the banded powers of Greece were tasked
To war beneath the Youth of Macedon:
No seemly veil her modern minion asked,
He saw her hideous face, and loved the fiend unmasked.

XLII.
That Prelate marked his march-On banners blazed
With battles won in many a distant land,
On eagle-standards and on arms he gazed;
'And hopest thou, then,' he said, 'thy power shall stand?
Oh! thou hast builded on the shifting sand,
And thou hast tempered it with slaughter's flood;
And know, fell scourge in the Almighty's hand,
Gore-moistened trees shall perish in the bud,
And by a bloody death shall die the Man of Blood!'

XLIII.
The ruthless Leader beckoned from his train
A wan fraternal Shade, and bade him kneel,
And paled his temples with the crown of Spain,
While trumpets rang, and heralds cried 'Castile!'
Not that he loved him-No!-In no man's weal,
Scarce in his own, e'er joyed that sullen heart;
Yet round that throne he bade his warriors wheel,
That the poor puppet might perform his part,
And be a sceptred slave, at his stern beck to start.

XLIV.
But on the Natives of that Land misused,
Not long the silence of amazement hung,
Nor brooked they long their friendly faith abused;
For, with a common shriek, the general tongue
Exclaimed, 'To arms!'-and fast to arms they sprung.
And VALOUR woke, that Genius of the Land!
Pleasure, and ease, and sloth aside he flung,
As burst the awakening Nazarite his band,
When 'gainst his treacherous foes he clenched his dreadful hand.

XLV.
That Mimic Monarch now cast anxious eye
Upon the Satraps that begirt him round,
Now doffed his royal robe in act to fly,
And from his brow the diadem unbound.
So oft, so near, the Patriot bugle wound,
From Tarik's walls to Bilboa's mountains blown,
These martial satellites hard labour found
To guard awhile his substituted throne -
Light recking of his cause, but battling for their own.

XLVI.
From Alpuhara's peak that bugle rung,
And it was echoed from Corunna's wall;
Stately Seville responsive war-shot flung,
Grenada caught it in her Moorish hall;
Galicia bade her children fight or fall,
Wild Biscay shook his mountain-coronet,
Valencia roused her at the battle-call,
And, foremost still where Valour's sons are met,
First started to his gun each fiery Miquelet.

XLVII.
But unappalled, and burning for the fight,
The Invaders march, of victory secure;
Skilful their force to sever or unite,
And trained alike to vanquish or endure.
Nor skilful less, cheap conquest to ensure,
Discord to breathe, and jealousy to sow,
To quell by boasting, and by bribes to lure;
While nought against them bring the unpractised foe,
Save hearts for Freedom's cause, and hands for Freedom's blow.

XLVIII.
Proudly they march-but, oh! they march not forth
By one hot field to crown a brief campaign,
As when their Eagles, sweeping through the North,
Destroyed at every stoop an ancient reign!
Far other fate had Heaven decreed for Spain;
In vain the steel, in vain the torch was plied,
New Patriot armies started from the slain,
High blazed the war, and long, and far, and wide,

XLIX.
Nor unatoned, where Freedom's foes prevail,
Remained their savage waste. With blade and brand
By day the Invaders ravaged hill and dale,
But, with the darkness, the Guerilla band
Came like night's tempest, and avenged the land,
And claimed for blood the retribution due,
Probed the hard heart, and lopped the murd'rous hand;
And Dawn, when o'er the scene her beams she threw
'Midst ruins they had made, the spoilers' corpses knew.

L.
What minstrel verse may sing, or tongue may tell,
Amid the visioned strife from sea to sea,
How oft the Patriot banners rose or fell,
Still honoured in defeat as victory!
For that sad pageant of events to be
Showed every form of fight by field and flood;
Slaughter and Ruin, shouting forth their glee,
Beheld, while riding on the tempest scud,
The waters choked with slain, the earth bedrenched with blood!

LI.
Then Zaragoza-blighted be the tongue
That names thy name without the honour due!
For never hath the harp of Minstrel rung,
Of faith so felly proved, so firmly true!
Mine, sap, and bomb thy shattered ruins knew,
Each art of war's extremity had room,
Twice from thy half-sacked streets the foe withdrew,
And when at length stern fate decreed thy doom,
They won not Zaragoza, but her children's bloody tomb.

LII.
Yet raise thy head, sad city! Though in chains,
Enthralled thou canst not be! Arise, and claim
Reverence from every heart where Freedom reigns,
For what thou worshippest!-thy sainted dame,
She of the Column, honoured be her name
By all, whate'er their creed, who honour love!
And like the sacred relics of the flame,
That gave some martyr to the blessed above,
To every loyal heart may thy sad embers prove!

LIII.
Nor thine alone such wreck. Gerona fair!
Faithful to death thy heroes shall be sung,
Manning the towers, while o'er their heads the air
Swart as the smoke from raging furnace hung;
Now thicker darkening where the mine was sprung,
Now briefly lightened by the cannon's flare,
Now arched with fire-sparks as the bomb was flung,
And reddening now with conflagration's glare,
While by the fatal light the foes for storm prepare.

LIV.
While all around was danger, strife, and fear,
While the earth shook, and darkened was the sky,
And wide Destruction stunned the listening ear,
Appalled the heart, and stupefied the eye, -
Afar was heard that thrice-repeated cry,
In which old Albion's heart and tongue unite,
Whene'er her soul is up, and pulse beats high,
Whether it hail the wine-cup or the fight,
And bid each arm be strong, or bid each heart be light.

LV.
Don Roderick turned him as the shout grew loud -
A varied scene the changeful vision showed,
For, where the ocean mingled with the cloud,
A gallant navy stemmed the billows broad.
From mast and stern St. George's symbol flowed,
Blent with the silver cross to Scotland dear;
Mottling the sea their landward barges rowed,
And flashed the sun on bayonet, brand, and spear,
And the wild beach returned the seamen's jovial cheer.

LVI.
It was a dread, yet spirit-stirring sight!
The billows foamed beneath a thousand oars,
Fast as they land the red-cross ranks unite,
Legions on legions bright'ning all the shores.
Then banners rise, and cannon-signal roars,
Then peals the warlike thunder of the drum,
Thrills the loud fife, the trumpet-flourish pours,
And patriot hopes awake, and doubts are dumb,
For, bold in Freedom's cause, the bands of Ocean come!

LVII.
A various host they came-whose ranks display
Each mode in which the warrior meets the fight,
The deep battalion locks its firm array,
And meditates his aim the marksman light;
Far glance the light of sabres flashing bright
Where mounted squadrons shake the echoing mead,
Lacks not artillery breathing flame and night,
Nor the fleet ordnance whirled by rapid steed,
That rivals lightning's flash in ruin and in speed.

LVIII.
A various host-from kindred realms they came,
Brethren in arms, but rivals in renown -
For yon fair bands shall merry England claim,
And with their deeds of valour deck her crown.
Hers their bold port, and hers their martial frown,
And hers their scorn of death in freedom's cause,
Their eyes of azure, and their locks of brown,
And the blunt speech that bursts without a pause,
And free-born thoughts which league the Soldier with the Laws.

LIX.
And, oh! loved warriors of the Minstrel's land!
Yonder your bonnets nod, your tartans wave!
The rugged form may mark the mountain band,
And harsher features, and a mien more grave;
But ne'er in battlefield throbbed heart so brave
As that which beats beneath the Scottish plaid;
And when the pibroch bids the battle rave,
And level for the charge your arms are laid,
Where lives the desperate foe that for such onset stayed!

LX.
Hark! from yon stately ranks what laughter rings,
Mingling wild mirth with war's stern minstrelsy,
His jest while each blithe comrade round him flings,
And moves to death with military glee:
Boast, Erin, boast them! tameless, frank, and free,
In kindness warm, and fierce in danger known,
Rough Nature's children, humorous as she:
And HE, yon Chieftain-strike the proudest tone
Of thy bold harp, green Isle!-the Hero is thine own.

LXI.
Now on the scene Vimeira should be shown,
On Talavera's fight should Roderick gaze,
And hear Corunna wail her battle won,
And see Busaco's crest with lightning blaze:-
But shall fond fable mix with heroes' praise?
Hath Fiction's stage for Truth's long triumphs room?
And dare her wild flowers mingle with the bays
That claim a long eternity to bloom
Around the warrior's crest, and o'er the warrior's tomb!

LXII.
Or may I give adventurous Fancy scope,
And stretch a bold hand to the awful veil
That hides futurity from anxious hope,
Bidding beyond it scenes of glory hail,
And painting Europe rousing at the tale
Of Spain's invaders from her confines hurled,
While kindling nations buckle on their mail,
And Fame, with clarion-blast and wings unfurled,
To Freedom and Revenge awakes an injured World!

LXIII.
O vain, though anxious, is the glance I cast,
Since Fate has marked futurity her own:
Yet Fate resigns to worth the glorious past,
The deeds recorded, and the laurels won.
Then, though the Vault of Destiny be gone,
King, Prelate, all the phantasms of my brain,
Melted away like mist-wreaths in the sun,
Yet grant for faith, for valour, and for Spain,
One note of pride and fire, a Patriot's parting strain!


CONCLUSION.


I.
' Who shall command Estrella's mountain-tide
Back to the source, when tempest-chafed, to hie?
Who, when Gascogne's vexed gulf is raging wide,
Shall hush it as a nurse her infant's cry?
His magic power let such vain boaster try,
And when the torrent shall his voice obey,
And Biscay's whirlwinds list his lullaby,
Let him stand forth and bar mine eagles' way,
And they shall heed his voice, and at his bidding stay.

II.
'Else ne'er to stoop, till high on Lisbon's towers
They close their wings, the symbol of our yoke,
And their own sea hath whelmed yon red-cross powers!'
Thus, on the summit of Alverca's rock
While downward on the land his legions press,
Before them it was rich with vine and flock,
And smiled like Eden in her summer dress; -
Behind their wasteful march a reeking wilderness.

III.
And shall the boastful Chief maintain his word,
Though Heaven hath heard the wailings of the land,
Though Lusitania whet her vengeful sword,
Though Britons arm and WELLINGTON command!
No! grim Busaco's iron ridge shall stand
An adamantine barrier to his force;
And from its base shall wheel his shattered band,
As from the unshaken rock the torrent hoarse
Bears off its broken waves, and seeks a devious course.

IV.
Yet not because Alcoba's mountain-hawk
Hath on his best and bravest made her food,
In numbers confident, yon Chief shall baulk
For full in view the promised conquest stood,
And Lisbon's matrons from their walls might sum
The myriads that had half the world subdued,
And hear the distant thunders of the drum,
That bids the bands of France to storm and havoc come.

V.
Four moons have heard these thunders idly rolled,
Have seen these wistful myriads eye their prey,
As famished wolves survey a guarded fold -
But in the middle path a Lion lay!
At length they move-but not to battle-fray,
Nor blaze yon fires where meets the manly fight;
Beacons of infamy, they light the way
Where cowardice and cruelty unite
To damn with double shame their ignominious flight.

VI.
O triumph for the Fiends of Lust and Wrath!
Ne'er to be told, yet ne'er to be forgot,
What wanton horrors marked their wreckful path!
The peasant butchered in his ruined cot,
The hoary priest even at the altar shot,
Childhood and age given o'er to sword and flame,
Woman to infamy;-no crime forgot,
By which inventive demons might proclaim

VII.
The rudest sentinel, in Britain born,
With horror paused to view the havoc done,
Gave his poor crust to feed some wretch forlorn,
Wiped his stern eye, then fiercer grasped his gun.
Nor with less zeal shall Britain's peaceful son
Exult the debt of sympathy to pay;
Riches nor poverty the tax shall shun,
Nor prince nor peer, the wealthy nor the gay,
Nor the poor peasant's mite, nor bard's more worthless lay.

VIII.
But thou-unfoughten wilt thou yield to Fate,
Minion of Fortune, now miscalled in vain!
Can vantage-ground no confidence create,
Marcella's pass, nor Guarda's mountain-chain?
Vainglorious fugitive! yet turn again!
Behold, where, named by some prophetic Seer,
Flows Honour's Fountain, { as foredoomed the stain
From thy dishonoured name and arms to clear -
Fallen Child of Fortune, turn, redeem her favour here!

IX.
Yet, ere thou turn'st, collect each distant aid;
Those chief that never heard the lion roar!
Within whose souls lives not a trace portrayed
Of Talavera or Mondego's shore!
Marshal each band thou hast, and summon more;
Of war's fell stratagems exhaust the whole;
Rank upon rank, squadron on squadron pour,
Legion on legion on thy foeman roll,
And weary out his arm-thou canst not quell his soul.

X.
O vainly gleams with steel Agueda's shore,
Vainly thy squadrons hide Assuava's plain,
And front the flying thunders as they roar,
With frantic charge and tenfold odds, in vain!
And what avails thee that, for CAMERON slain,
Wild from his plaided ranks the yell was given -
Vengeance and grief gave mountain-range the rein,
And, at the bloody spear-point headlong driven,
Thy Despot's giant guards fled like the rack of heaven.

XI.
Go, baffled boaster! teach thy haughty mood
To plead at thine imperious master's throne,
Say, thou hast left his legions in their blood,
Deceived his hopes, and frustrated thine own;
Say, that thine utmost skill and valour shown,
By British skill and valour were outvied;
Last say, thy conqueror was WELLINGTON!
And if he chafe, be his own fortune tried -

XII.
But you, ye heroes of that well-fought day,
How shall a bard, unknowing and unknown,
His meed to each victorious leader pay,
Or bind on every brow the laurels won?
Yet fain my harp would wake its boldest tone,
O'er the wide sea to hail CADOGAN brave;
And he, perchance, the minstrel-note might own,
Mindful of meeting brief that Fortune gave
'Mid yon far western isles that hear the Atlantic rave.

XIII.
Yes! hard the task, when Britons wield the sword,
To give each Chief and every field its fame:
Hark! Albuera thunders BERESFORD,
And Red Barosa shouts for dauntless GRAEME!
O for a verse of tumult and of flame,
Bold as the bursting of their cannon sound,
To bid the world re-echo to their fame!
For never, upon gory battle-ground,
With conquest's well-bought wreath were braver victors crowned!

XIV.
O who shall grudge him Albuera's bays,
Who brought a race regenerate to the field,
Roused them to emulate their fathers' praise,
Tempered their headlong rage, their courage steeled,
And raised fair Lusitania's fallen shield,
And gave new edge to Lusitania's sword,
And taught her sons forgotten arms to wield -
Shivered my harp, and burst its every chord,
If it forget thy worth, victorious BERESFORD!

XV.
Not on that bloody field of battle won,
Though Gaul's proud legions rolled like mist away,
Was half his self-devoted valour shown, -
He gaged but life on that illustrious day;
But when he toiled those squadrons to array,
Who fought like Britons in the bloody game,
Sharper than Polish pike or assagay,
He braved the shafts of censure and of shame,
And, dearer far than life, he pledged a soldier's fame.

XVI.
Nor be his praise o'erpast who strove to hide
Beneath the warrior's vest affection's wound,
Whose wish Heaven for his country's weal denied;
Danger and fate he sought, but glory found.
From clime to clime, where'er war's trumpets sound,
The wanderer went; yet Caledonia! still
Thine was his thought in march and tented ground;
He dreamed 'mid Alpine cliffs of Athole's hill,
And heard in Ebro's roar his Lyndoch's lovely rill.

XVII.
O hero of a race renowned of old,
Whose war-cry oft has waked the battle-swell,
Since first distinguished in the onset bold,
Wild sounding when the Roman rampart fell!
By Wallace' side it rung the Southron's knell,
Alderne, Kilsythe, and Tibber owned its fame,
Tummell's rude pass can of its terrors tell,
But ne'er from prouder field arose the name
Than when wild Ronda learned the conquering shout of GRAEME!

XVIII.
But all too long, through seas unknown and dark,
(With Spenser's parable I close my tale,)
By shoal and rock hath steered my venturous bark,
And landward now I drive before the gale.
And now the blue and distant shore I hail,
And nearer now I see the port expand,
And now I gladly furl my weary sail,
And, as the prow light touches on the strand,
I strike my red-cross flag and bind my skiff to land. 

I 

Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate: 
  His keys were rusty, and the lock was dull, 
So little trouble had been given of late; 
  Not that the place by any means was full, 
But since the Gallic era 'eight-eight' 
  The devils had ta'en a longer, stronger pull, 
And 'a pull altogether,' as they say 
At sea — which drew most souls another way. 

II 

The angels all were singing out of tune, 
  And hoarse with having little else to do, 
Excepting to wind up the sun and moon, 
  Or curb a runaway young star or two, 
Or wild colt of a comet, which too soon 
  Broke out of bounds o'er th' ethereal blue, 
Splitting some planet with its playful tail, 
As boats are sometimes by a wanton whale. 

III 

The guardian seraphs had retired on high, 
  Finding their charges past all care below; 
Terrestrial business fill'd nought in the sky 
  Save the recording angel's black bureau; 
Who found, indeed, the facts to multiply 
  With such rapidity of vice and woe, 
That he had stripp'd off both his wings in quills, 
And yet was in arrear of human ills. 

IV 

His business so augmented of late years, 
  That he was forced, against his will no doubt, 
(Just like those cherubs, earthly ministers,) 
  For some resource to turn himself about, 
And claim the help of his celestial peers, 
  To aid him ere he should be quite worn out 
By the increased demand for his remarks: 
Six angels and twelve saints were named his clerks. 

V 

This was a handsome board — at least for heaven; 
  And yet they had even then enough to do, 
So many conqueror's cars were daily driven, 
  So many kingdoms fitted up anew; 
Each day too slew its thousands six or seven, 
  Till at the crowning carnage, Waterloo, 
They threw their pens down in divine disgust — 
The page was so besmear'd with blood and dust. 

VI 

This by the way: 'tis not mine to record 
  What angels shrink Wrom: ZAAFXISHJEXXIMQZUIVO 
On this occasion his own work abhorr'd, 
  So surfeited with the infernal revel: 
Though he himself had sharpen'd every sword, 
  It almost quench'd his innate thirst of evil. 
(Here Satan's sole good work deserves insertion — 
'Tis, that he has both generals in reveration.) 

VII 

Let's skip a few short years of hollow peace, 
  Which peopled earth no better, hell as wont, 
And heaven none — they form the tyrant's lease, 
  With nothing but new names subscribed upon't; 
'Twill one day finish: meantime they increase, 
  'With seven heads and ten horns,' and all in front, 
Like Saint John's foretold beast; but ours are born 
Less formidable in the head than horn. 

VIII 

In the first year of freedom's second dawn 
  Died George the Third; although no tyrant, one 
Who shielded tyrants, till each sense withdrawn 
  Left him nor mental nor external sun: 
A better farmer ne'er brush'd dew from lawn, 
  A worse king never left a realm undone! 
He died — but left his subjects still behind, 
One half as mad — and t'other no less blind. 

IX 

He died! his death made no great stir on earth: 
  His burial made some pomp; there was profusion 
Of velvet, gilding, brass, and no great dearth 
  Of aught but tears — save those shed by collusion. 
For these things may be bought at their true worth; 
  Of elegy there was the due infusion — 
Bought also; and the torches, cloaks, and banners, 
Heralds, and relics of old Gothic manners,

Form'd a sepulchral melo-drame. Of all 
  The fools who flack's to swell or see the show, 
Who cared about the corpse? The funeral 
  Made the attraction, and the black the woe. 
There throbbed not there a thought which pierced the pall; 
  And when the gorgeous coffin was laid low, 
It seamed the mockery of hell to fold 
The rottenness of eighty years in gold. 

XI 

So mix his body with the dust! It might 
  Return to what it must far sooner, were 
The natural compound left alone to fight 
  Its way back into earth, and fire, and air; 
But the unnatural balsams merely blight 
  What nature made him at his birth, as bare 
As the mere million's base unmarried clay — 
Yet all his spices but prolong decay. 

XII 

He's dead — and upper earth with him has done; 
  He's buried; save the undertaker's bill, 
Or lapidary scrawl, the world is gone 
  For him, unless he left a German will: 
But where's the proctor who will ask his son? 
  In whom his qualities are reigning still, 
Except that household virtue, most uncommon, 
Of constancy to a bad, ugly woman. 

XIII 

Be saving, all the better; for not one am I 
  Of those who think damnation better still: 
I hardly know too if not quite alone am I 
  In this small hope of bettering future ill 
By circumscribing, with some slight restriction, 
The eternity of hell's hot jurisdiction. 

XIV 

I know this is unpopular; I know 
  'Tis blasphemous; I know one may be damned 
For hoping no one else may ever be so; 
  I know my catechism; I know we're caromed 
With the best doctrines till we quite o'erflow; 
  I know that all save England's church have shamm'd, 
And that the other twice two hundred churches 
And synagogues have made a damn'd bad purchase. 

XV 

And not a whit more difficult to damn, 
  Than is to bring to land a late-hook'd fish, 
Or to the butcher to purvey the lamb; 
  Not that I'm fit for such a noble dish, 
As one day will be that immortal fry 
Of almost everybody born to die. 

XVI 

Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate, 
  And nodded o'er his keys; when, lo! there came 
A wondrous noise he had not heard of late — 
  A rushing sound of wind, and stream, and flame; 
In short, a roar of things extremely great, 
  Which would have made aught save a saint exclaim; 
But he, with first a start and then a wink, 
Said, 'There's another star gone out, I think!' 

XVII 

But ere he could return to his repose, 
  A cherub flapp'd his right wing o'er his eyes — 
At which St. Peter yawn'd, and rubb'd his hose: 
  'Saint porter,' said the angel, 'prithee rise!' 
Waving a goodly wing, which glow'd, as glows 
  An earthly peacock's tail, with heavenly dyes; 
To which the saint replied, 'Well, what's the matter? 
'Is Lucifer come back with all this clatter?' 

XVIII 

'No,' quoth the cherub; 'George the Third is dead.' 
  'And who is George the Third?' replied the apostle; 
'What George? what Third?' 'The king of England,' said 
  The angel. 'Well, he won't find kings to jostle 
Him on his way; but does he wear his head? 
  Because the last we saw here had a tussle, 
And ne'er would have got into heaven's good graces, 
Had he not flung his head in all our faces. 

XIX 

'He was, if I remember, king of France; 
  That head of his, which could not keep a crown 
On earth, yet ventured in my face to advance 
  A claim to those of martyrs — like my own: 
If I had had my sword, as I had once 
  When I cut ears off, I had cut him down; 
But having but my keys, and not my brand, 
I only knock'd his head from out his hand. 

XX 

'And then he set up such a headless howl, 
  That all the saints came out and took him in; 
And there he sits by St. Paul, cheek by jowl; 
  That fellow Paul— the parvenù! The skin 
Of St. Bartholomew, which makes his cowl 
  In heaven, and upon earth redeem'd his sin, 
So as to make a martyr, never sped 
Better than did this weak and wooden head. 

XXI 

'But had it come up here upon its shoulders, 
  There would have been a different tale to tell; 
The fellow-feeling in the saint's beholders 
  Seems to have acted on them like a spell, 
And so this very foolish head heaven solders 
  Back on its trunk: it may be very well, 
And seems the custom here to overthrow 
Whatever has been wisely done below.' 

XXII 

The angel answer'd, 'Peter! do not pout: 
  The king who comes has head and all entire, 
And never knew much what it was about — 
  He did as doth the puppet — by its wire, 
And will be judged like all the rest, no doubt: 
  My business and your own is not to inquire 
Into such matters, but to mind our cue — 
Which is to act as we are bid to do.' 

XXIII 

While thus they spake, the angelic caravan, 
  Arriving like a rush of mighty wind, 
Cleaving the fields of space, as doth the swan 
  Some silver stream (say Ganges, Nile, or Inde, 
Or Thames, or Tweed), and 'midst them an old man 
  With an old soul, and both extremely blind, 
Halted before the gate, and in his shroud 
Seated their fellow traveller on a cloud. 

XXIV 

But bringing up the rear of this bright host 
  A Spirit of a different aspect waves 
His wings, like thunder-clouds above some coast 
  Whose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved; 
His brow was like the deep when tempest-toss'd; 
  Fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved 
Eternal wrath on his immortal face, 
And where he gazed a gloom pervaded space. 

XXV 

As he drew near, he gazed upon the gate 
  Ne'er to be enter'd more by him or Sin, 
With such a glance of supernatural hate, 
  As made Saint Peter wish himself within; 
He potter'd with his keys at a great rate, 
  And sweated through his apostolic skin: 
Of course his perspiration was but ichor, 
Or some such other spiritual liquor. 

XXIV 

The very cherubs huddled all together, 
  Like birds when soars the falcon; and they felt 
A tingling to the top of every feather, 
  And form'd a circle like Orion's belt 
Around their poor old charge; who scarce knew whither 
  His guards had led him, though they gently dealt 
With royal manes (for by many stories, 
And true, we learn the angels all are Tories.) 

XXVII 

As things were in this posture, the gate flew 
  Asunder, and the flashing of its hinges 
Flung over space an universal hue 
  Of many-colour'd flame, until its tinges 
Reach'd even our speck of earth, and made a new 
  Aurora borealis spread its fringes 
O'er the North Pole; the same seen, when ice-bound, 
By Captain Parry's crew, in 'Melville's Sound.' 

XXVIII 

And from the gate thrown open issued beaming 
  A beautiful and mighty Thing of Light, 
Radiant with glory, like a banner streaming 
  Victorious from some world-o'erthrowing fight: 
My poor comparisons must needs be teeming 
  With earthly likenesses, for here the night 
Of clay obscures our best conceptions, saving 
Johanna Southcote, or Bob Southey raving. 

XXIX 

'Twas the archangel Michael; all men know 
  The make of angels and archangels, since 
There's scarce a scribbler has not one to show, 
  From the fiends' leader to the angels' prince; 
There also are some altar-pieces, though 
  I really can't say that they much evince 
One's inner notions of immortal spirits; 
But let the connoisseurs explain their merits. 

XXX 

Michael flew forth in glory and in good; 
  A goodly work of him from whom all glory 
And good arise; the portal past — he stood; 
  Before him the young cherubs and saints hoary — 
(I say young, begging to be understood 
  By looks, not years; and should be very sorry 
To state, they were not older than St. Peter, 
But merely that they seem'd a little sweeter. 

XXXI 

The cherubs and the saints bow'd down before 
  That arch-angelic Hierarch, the first 
Of essences angelical, who wore 
  The aspect of a god; but this ne'er nursed 
Pride in his heavenly bosom, in whose core 
  No thought, save for his Master's service, durst 
Intrude, however glorified and high; 
He knew him but the viceroy of the sky. 

XXXII 

He and the sombre, silent Spirit met — 
  They knew each other both for good and ill; 
Such was their power, that neither could forget 
  His former friend and future foe; but still 
There was a high, immortal, proud regret 
  In either's eye, as if 'twere less their will 
Than destiny to make the eternal years 
Their date of war, and their 'champ clos' the spheres. 

XXXIII 

But here they were in neutral space: we know 
  From Job, that Satan hath the power to pay 
A heavenly visit thrice a year or so; 
Must keep him company; and we might show 
  From the same book, in how polite a way 
The dialogue is held between the Powers 
Of Good and Evil — but 'twould take up hours. 

XXXIV 

And this is not a theologic tract, 
  To prove with Hebrew and with Arabic, 
If Job be allegory or a fact, 
  But a true narrative; and thus I pick 
From out the whole but such and such an act 
  As sets aside the slightest thought of trick. 
'Tis every tittle true, beyond suspicion, 
And accurate as any other vision. 

XXXV 

The spirits were in neutral space, before 
  The gates of heaven; like eastern thresholds is 
The place where Death's grand cause is argued o'er, 
  And souls despatch'd to that world or to this; 
And therefore Michael and the other wore 
  A civil aspect: though they did not kiss, 
Yet still between his Darkness and his Brightness 
There pass'd a mutual glance of great politeness. 

XXXVI 

The Archangel bow'd, not like a modern beau, 
  But with a graceful Oriental bend, 
Pressing one radiant arm just where below 
  The heart in good men is supposed to tend; 
He turn'd as to an equal, not too low, 
  But kindly; Satan met his ancient friend 
With more hauteur, as might an old Castilian 
Poor noble meet a mushroom rich civilian. 

XXXVII 

He merely bent his diabolic brow 
  An instant; and then raising it, he stood 
In act to assert his right or wrong, and show 
  Cause why King George by no means could or should 
Make out a case to be exempt from woe 
  Eternal, more than other kings, endued 
With better sense and hearts, whom history mentions, 
Who long have 'paved hell with their good intentions.' 

XXXVIII 

Michael began: 'What wouldst thou with this man, 
Hath he wrought since his mortal race began, 
  That thou cans't claim him? Speak! and do thy will, 
If it be just: if in this earthly span 
  He hath been greatly failing to fulfil 
His duties as a king and mortal, say, 
And he is thine; if not, let him have way.' 

XXXIX 

'Michael!' replied the Prince of Air, 'even here, 
  Before the Gate of him thou servest, must 
I claim my subject: and will make appear 
  That as he was my worshipper in dust, 
So shall he be in spirit, although dear 
  To thee and thine, because nor wine nor lust 
Were of his weaknesses; yet on the throne 
He reign'd o'er millions to serve me alone. 

XL 

'Look to our earth, or rather mine; it was, 
  Once, more thy master's: but I triumph not 
In this poor planet's conquest; nor, alas! 
  Need he thou servest envy me my lot: 
With all the myriads of bright worlds which pass 
  In worship round him, he may have forgot 
Yon weak creation of such paltry things; 
I think few worth damnation save their kings, — 

XLI 

'And these but as a kind of quit-rent, to 
  Assert my right as lord: and even had 
I such an inclination, 'twere (as you 
  Well know) superfluous; they are grown so bad, 
That hell has nothing better left to do 
  Than leave them to themselves: so much more mad 
And evil by their own internal curse, 
Heaven cannot make them better, nor I worse. 

XLII 

'Look to the earth, I said, and say again: 
  When this old, blind, mad, helpless, weak, poor worm 
Began in youth's first bloom and flush to reign, 
  The world and he both wore a different form, 
And must of earth and all the watery plain 
  Of ocean call'd him king: through many a storm 
His isles had floated on the abyss of time; 
For the rough virtues chose them for their clime. 

XLIII 

'He came to his sceptre young: he leaves it old: 
  Look to the state in which he found his realm, 
And left it; and his annals too behold, 
  How to a minion first he gave the helm; 
How grew upon his heart a thirst for gold, 
  The beggar's vice, which can but overwhelm 
The meanest of hearts; and for the rest, but glance 
Thine eye along America and France. 

XLIV 

'Tis true, he was a tool from first to last 
  (I have the workmen safe); but as a tool 
So let him be consumed. From out the past 
  Of ages, since mankind have known the rule 
Of monarchs — from the bloody rolls amass'd 
  Of sin and slaughter — from the Caesar's school, 
Take the worst pupil; and produce a reign 
More drench'd with gore, more cumber'd with the slain. 

XLV 

'He ever warr'd with freedom and the free: 
  Nations as men, home subjects, foreign foes, 
So that they utter'd the word "Liberty!" 
  Found George the Third their first opponent. Whose 
History was ever stain'd as his will be 
  With national and individual woes? 
I grant his household abstinence; I grant 
His neutral virtues, which most monarchs want; 

XLVI 

'I know he was a constant consort; own 
  He was a decent sire, and middling lord. 
All this is much, and most upon a throne; 
  As temperance, if at Apicius' board, 
Is more than at an anchorite's supper shown. 
  I grant him all the kindest can accord; 
And this was well for him, but not for those 
Millions who found him what oppression chose. 

XLVII 

'The New World shook him off; the Old yet groans 
  Beneath what he and his prepared, if not 
Completed: he leaves heirs on many thrones 
  To all his vices, without what begot 
Compassion for him — his tame virtues; drones 
  Who sleep, or despots who have not forgot 
A lesson which shall be re-taught them, wake 
Upon the thrones of earth; but let them quake! 

XLVIII 

'Five millions of the primitive, who hold 
  The faith which makes ye great on earth, implored 
A part of that vast all they held of old, — 
Michael, but you, and you, Saint Peter! Cold 
  Must be your souls, if you have not abhorr'd 
The foe to Catholic participation 

XLIX 

  A consequence of prayer, refused the law 
Which would have placed them upon the same base 
  With those who did not hold the saints in awe.' 
But here Saint Peter started from his place, 
  And cried, 'You may the prisoner withdraw: 
Ere heaven shall ope her portals to this Guelph, 
While I am guard, may I be damn'd myself! 

L 

'Sooner will I with Cerberus exchange 
  My office (and his no sinecure) 
Than see this royal Bedlam bigot range 
  The azure fields of heaven, of that be sure!' 
'Saint!' replied Satan, 'you do well to avenge 
  The wrongs he made your satellites endure; 
And if to this exchange you should be given, 
I'll try to coax our Cerberus up to heaven!' 

LI 

Here Michael interposed: 'Good saint! and devil! 
  Pray, not so fast; you both outrun discretion. 
Saint Peter! you were wont to be more civil! 
  Satan! excuse this warmth of his expression, 
And condescension to the vulgar's level: 
  Event saints sometimes forget themselves in session. 
Have you got more to say?' — 'No.' — If you please 
I'll trouble you to call your witnesses.' 

LII 

Then Satan turn'd and waved his swarthy hand, 
  Which stirr'd with its electric qualities 
Clouds farther off than we can understand, 
  Although we find him sometimes in our skies; 
Infernal thunder shook both sea and land 
  In all the planets, and hell's batteries 
Let off the artillery, which Milton mentions 
As one of Satan's most sublime inventions. 

LIII 

This was a signal unto such damn'd souls 
  As have the privilege of their damnation 
Extended far beyond the mere controls 
  Of worlds past, present, or to come; no station 
Is theirs particularly in the rolls 
  Of hell assign'd; but where their inclination 
Or business carries them in search of game, 
They may range freely — being damn'd the same. 

LIV 

They're proud of this — as very well they may, 
  It being a sort of knighthood, or gilt key 
Stuck in their loins; or like to an 'entre' 
  Up the back stairs, or such free-masonry. 
I borrow my comparisons from clay, 
  Being clay myself. Let not those spirits be 
Offended with such base low likenesses; 
We know their posts are nobler far than these. 

LV 

When the great signal ran from heaven to hell — 
  About ten million times the distance reckon'd 
From our sun to its earth, as we can tell 
  How much time it takes up, even to a second, 
For every ray that travels to dispel 
  The fogs of London, through which, dimly beacon'd, 
The weathercocks are gilt some thrice a year, 
If that the summer is not too severe; 

LVI 

I say that I can tell — 'twas half a minute; 
  I know the solar beams take up more time 
Ere, pack'd up for their journey, they begin it; 
  But then their telegraph is less sublime, 
And if they ran a race, they would not win it 
  'Gainst Satan's couriers bound for their own clime. 
The sun takes up some years for every ray 
To reach its goal — the devil not half a day. 

LVII 

Upon the verge of space, about the size 
  Of half-a-crown, a little speck appear'd 
(I've seen a something like it in the skies 
  In the aegean, ere a squall); it near'd, 
And growing bigger, took another guise; 
  Like an aerial ship it tack'd, and steer'd, 
Or was steer'd (I am doubtful of the grammar 
Of the last phrase, which makes the stanza stammer; — 

LVIII 

But take your choice): and then it grew a cloud; 
  And so it was — a cloud of witnesses. 
But such a cloud! No land e'er saw a crowd 
  Of locusts numerous as the heavens saw these; 
They shadow'd with their myriads space; their loud 
  And varied cries were like those of wild geese 
(If nations may be liken'd to a goose), 
And realised the phrase of 'hell broke loose.' 

LIX 

Here crash'd a sturdy oath of stout John Bull, 
  Who damn'd away his eyes as heretofore: 
There Paddy brogued, 'By Jasus!' — 'What's your wull?' 
  The temperate Scot exclaim'd: the French ghost swore 
In certain terms I shan't translate in full, 
  As the first coachman will; and 'midst the roar, 
The voice of Jonathan was heard to express, 
'Our president is going to war, I guess.' 

LX 

Besides there were the Spaniard, Dutch, and Dane; 
  In short, an universal shoal of shades, 
From Otaheite's isle to Salisbury Plain, 
  Of all climes and professions, years and trades, 
Ready to swear against the good king's reign, 
  Bitter as clubs in cards are against spades: 
All summon'd by this grand 'subpoena,' to 
Try if kings mayn't be damn'd like me or you. 

LXI 

When Michael saw this host, he first grew pale, 
  As angels can; next, like Italian twilight, 
He turn'd all colours — as a peacock's tail, 
  Or sunset streaming through a Gothic skylight 
In some old abbey, or a trout not stale, 
  Or distant lightning on the horizon by night, 
Or a fresh rainbow, or a grand review 
Of thirty regiments in red, green, and blue. 

LXII 

Then he address'd himself to Satan: 'Why — 
  My good old friend, for such I deem you, though 
Our different parties make us fight so shy, 
  I ne'er mistake you for a personal foe; 
Our difference is political, and I 
  Trust that, whatever may occur below, 
You know my great respect for you; and this 
Makes me regret whate'er you do amiss — 

LXIII 

'Why, my dear Lucifer, would you abuse 
  My call for witnesses? I did not mean 
That you should half of earth and hell produce; 
  'Tis even superfluous, since two honest, clean 
True testimonies are enough: we lose 
  Our time, nay, our eternity, between 
The accusation and defence: if we 
Hear both, 'twill stretch our immortality.' 

LXIV 

Satan replied, 'To me the matter is 
  Indifferent, in a personal point of view; 
I can have fifty better souls than this 
  With far less trouble than we have gone through 
Already; and I merely argued his 
  Late majesty of Britain's case with you 
Upon a point of form: you may dispose 

LXV 

Thus spoke the Demon (late call'd 'multifaced' 
  By multo-scribbling Southey). 'Then we'll call 
One or two persons of the myriads placed 
  Around our congress, and dispense with all 
The rest,' quoth Michael: 'Who may be so graced 
  As to speak first? there's choice enough — who shall 
It be?' Then Satan answer'd, 'There are many; 
But you may choose Jack Wilkes as well as any.' 

LXVI 

A merry, cock-eyed, curious-looking sprite 
  Upon the instant started from the throng, 
Dress'd in a fashion now forgotten quite; 
  For all the fashions of the flesh stick long 
By people in the next world; where unite 
  All the costumes since Adam's, right or wrong, 
From Eve's fig-leaf down to the petticoat, 
Almost as scanty, of days less remote. 

LXVII 

The spirit look'd around upon the crowds 
  Assembled, and exclaim'd, 'My friends of all 
The spheres, we shall catch cold amongst these clouds; 
  So let's to business: why this general call? 
If those are freeholders I see in shrouds, 
  And 'tis for an election that they bawl, 
Behold a candidate with unturn'd coat! 
Saint Peter, may I count upon your vote?' 

LXVIII 

'Sir,' replied Michael, 'you mistake; these things 
  Are of a former life, and what we do 
Above is more august; to judge of kings 
  Is the tribunal met: so now you know.' 
'Then I presume those gentlemen with wings,' 
  Said Wilkes, 'are cherubs; and that soul below 
Looks much like George the Third, but to my mind 
A good deal older — Bless me! is he blind?' 

LXIX 

'He is what you behold him, and his doom 
  Depends upon his deeds,' the Angel said; 
'If you have aught to arraign in him, the tomb 
  Give licence to the humblest beggar's head 
To lift itself against the loftiest.' — 'Some,' 
  Said Wilkes, 'don't wait to see them laid in lead, 
For such a liberty — and I, for one, 
Have told them what I though beneath the sun.' 

LXX 

'Above the sun repeat, then, what thou hast 
  To urge against him,' said the Archangel. 'Why,' 
Replied the spirit, 'since old scores are past, 
  Must I turn evidence? In faith, not I. 
Besides, I beat him hollow at the last, 
I don't like ripping up old stories, since 
His conduct was but natural in a prince. 

LXXI 

'Foolish, no doubt, and wicked, to oppress 
  A poor unlucky devil without a shilling; 
But then I blame the man himself much less 
  Than Bute and Grafton, and shall be unwilling 
To see him punish'd here for their excess, 
  Since they were both damn'd long ago, and still in 
Their place below: for me, I have forgiven, 
And vote his "habeas corpus" into heaven.' 

LXXII 

'Wilkes,' said the Devil, 'I understand all this; 
  You turn'd to half a courtier ere you died, 
And seem to think it would not be amiss 
  To grow a whole one on the other side 
Of Charon's ferry; you forget that his 
  Reign is concluded; whatso'er betide, 
He won't be sovereign more: you've lost your labor, 
For at the best he will be but your neighbour. 

LXXIII 

'However, I knew what to think of it, 
  When I beheld you in your jesting way, 
Flitting and whispering round about the spit 
  Where Belial, upon duty for the day, 
With Fox's lard was basting William Pitt, 
  His pupil; I knew what to think, I say: 
That fellow even in hell breeds farther ills; 
I'll have him gagg'd — 'twas one of his own bills. 

LXXIV 

'Call Junius!' From the crowd a shadow stalk'd, 
  And at the same there was a general squeeze, 
So that the very ghosts no longer walk'd 
  In comfort, at their own aerial ease, 
But were all ramm'd, and jamm'd (but to be balk'd, 
  As we shall see), and jostled hands and knees, 
Like wind compress'd and pent within a bladder, 
Or like a human colic, which is sadder. 

LXXV 

The shadow came — a tall, thin, grey-hair'd figure, 
  That look'd as it had been a shade on earth; 
Quick in it motions, with an air of vigour, 
  But nought to mar its breeding or its birth; 
Now it wax'd little, then again grew bigger, 
  With now an air of gloom, or savage mirth; 
But as you gazed upon its features, they 
Changed every instant — to what, none could say. 

LXXVI 

The more intently the ghosts gazed, the less 
  Could they distinguish whose the features were; 
The Devil himself seem'd puzzled even to guess; 
  They varied like a dream — now here, now there; 
And several people swore from out the press 
  They knew him perfectly; and one could swear 
He was his father: upon which another 
Was sure he was his mother's cousin's brother: 

LXXVII 

  An orator, a lawyer, or a priest, 
A nabob, a man-midwife; but the wight 
  Mysterious changed his countenance at least 
As oft as they their minds; though in full sight 
  He stood, the puzzle only was increased; 
Himself — he was so volatile and thin. 

LXXVIII 

The moment that you had pronounce him one, 
  Presto! his face change'd and he was another; 
And when that change was hardly well put on, 
  It varied, till I don't think his own mother 
(If that he had a mother) would her son 
  Have known, he shifted so from one to t'other; 
Till guessing from a pleasure grew a task, 
At this epistolary 'Iron Mask.' 

LXXIX 

For sometimes he like Cerberus would seem — 
  'Three gentlemen at once' (as sagely says 
Good Mrs. Malaprop); then you might deem 
  That he was not even one; now many rays 
Were flashing round him; and now a thick steam 
  Hid him from sight — like fogs on London days: 
Now Burke, now Tooke he grew to people's fancies, 
And certes often like Sir Philip Francis. 

LXXX 

I've an hypothesis — 'tis quite my own; 
  I never let it out till now, for fear 
Of doing people harm about the throne, 
  And injuring some minister or peer, 
On whom the stigma might perhaps be blown; 
  It is — my gentle public, lend thine ear! 
'Tis, that what Junius we are wont to call 
Was really, truly, nobody at all. 

LXXXI 

I don't see wherefore letters should not be 
  Written without hands, since we daily view 
Them written without heads; and books, we see, 
  Are fill'd as well without the latter too: 
And really till we fix on somebody 
  For certain sure to claim them as his due, 
Their author, like the Niger's mouth, will bother 
The world to say if there be mouth or author. 

LXXXII 

'And who and what art thou?' the Archangel said. 
  'For that you may consult my title-page,' 
Replied this mighty shadow of a shade: 
  'If I have kept my secret half an age, 
I scarce shall tell it now.' — 'Canst thou upbraid,' 
  Continued Michael, 'George Rex, or allege 
Aught further?' Junius answer'd, 'You had better 
First ask him for his answer to my letter: 

LXXXIII 

'My charges upon record will outlast 
  The brass of both his epitaph and tomb.' 
'Repent'st thou not,' said Michael, 'of some past 
  Exaggeration? something which may doom 
Thyself if false, as him if true? Thou wast 
  Too bitter — is it not so? — in thy gloom 
Of passion?' — 'Passion!' cried the phantom dim, 
'I loved my country, and I hated him. 

LXXXIV 

  The rest be on his head or mine!' So spoke 
Old 'Nominis Umbra'; and while speaking yet, 
  Away he melted in celestial smoke. 
Then Satan said to Michael, 'Don't forget 
  To call George Washington, and John Horne Tooke, 
And Franklin;' — but at this time was heard 
A cry for room, though not a phantom stirr'd. 

LXXXV 

At length with jostling, elbowing, and the aid 
  Of cherubim appointed to that post, 
The devil Asmodeus to the circle made 
  His way, and look'd as if his journey cost 
Some trouble. When his burden down he laid, 
  'What's this?' cried Michael; 'why, 'tis not a ghost?' 
'I know it,' quoth the incubus; 'but he 
Shall be one, if you leave the affair to me. 

LXXXVI 

'Confound the renegado! I have sprain'd 
  My left wing, he's so heavy; one would think 
Some of his works about his neck were chain'd. 
  But to the point; while hovering o'er the brink 
Of Skiddaw (where as usual it still rain'd), 
  I saw a taper, far below me, wink, 
And stooping, caught this fellow at a libel — 
No less on history than the Holy Bible. 

LXXXVII 

  The latter yours, good Michael: so the affair 
Belongs to all of us, you understand. 
  I snatch'd him up just as you see him there, 
And brought him off for sentence out of hand: 
  I've scarcely been ten minutes in the air — 
At least a quarter it can hardly be: 
I dare say that his wife is still at tea.' 

LXXXVIII 

Here Satan said, 'I know this man of old, 
  And have expected him for some time here; 
A sillier fellow you will scarce behold, 
  Or more conceited in his petty sphere: 
But surely it was not worth while to fold 
  Such trash below your wing, Asmodeus dear: 
We had the poor wretch safe (without being bored 
With carriage) coming of his own accord. 

LXXXIX 

'But since he's here, let's see what he has done.' 
  'Done!' cried Asmodeus, 'he anticipates 
The very business you are now upon, 
  And scribbles as if head clerk to the Fates, 
Who knows to what his ribaldry may run, 
  When such an ass as this, like Balaam's, prates?' 
'Let's hear,' quoth Michael, 'what he has to say; 
You know we're bound to that in every way.' 

XC 

Now the bard, glad to get an audience which 
  By no means oft was his case below, 
Began to cough, and hawk, and hem, and pitch 
  His voice into that awful note of woe 
To all unhappy hearers within reach 
  Of poets when the tide of rhyme's in flow; 
But stuck fast with his first hexameter, 
Not one of all whose gouty feet would stir. 

XCI 

But ere the spavin'd dactyls could be spurr'd 
  Into recitative, in great dismay 
Both cherubim and seraphim were heard 
  To murmur loudly through their long array: 
And Michael rose ere he could get a word 
  Of all his founder'd verses under way. 
Non Di, non homines —- you know the rest.' 

XCII 

A general bustle spread throughout the throng. 
  Which seem'd to hold all verse in detestation; 
The angels had of course enough of song 
  When upon service; and the generation 
Of ghosts had heard too much in life, not long 
  Before, to profit by a new occasion; 
The monarch, mute till then, exclaim'd, 'What! What! 
Pye come again? No more — no more of that!' 

XCIII 

The tumult grew; an universal cough 
  Convulsed the skies, as during a debate 
When Castlereagh has been up long enough 
  (Before he was first minister of state, 
I mean — the slaves hear now); some cried 'off, off!' 
  As at a farce; till, grown quite desperate, 
The bard Saint Peter pray'd to interpose 
(Himself an author) only for his prose. 

XCIV 

The varlet was not an ill-favour'd knave; 
  A good deal like a vulture in the face, 
With a hook nose and a hawk'd eye, which gave 
  A smart and sharper-looking sort of grace 
To his whole aspect, which, though rather grave, 
  Was by no means so ugly as his case; 
But that, indeed, was hopeless as can be, 
Quite a poetic felony, 'de se.' 

XCV 

Then Michael blew his trump, and still'd the noise 
  With one still greater, as is yet the mode 
On earth besides; except some grumbling voice, 
  Which now and then will make a slight inroad 
Upon decorous silence, few will twice 
  Lift up their lungs when fairly overcrow'd; 
And now the bard could plead his own bad cause, 
With all the attitudes of self-applause. 

XCVI 

He said — (I only give the heads) — he said, 
  He meant no harm in scribbling; 'twas his way 
Upon all topics; 'twas, besides, his bread, 
  Of which he butter'd both sides; 'twould delay 
Too long the assembly (he was pleased to dread), 
  And take up rather more time than a day, 
To name his works — he would but cite a few — 
'Wat Tyler' — 'Rhymes on Blenheim' — 'Waterloo.' 

XCVII 

He had written praises of a regicide: 
  He had written praises of all kings whatever; 
He had written for republics far and wide; 
  And then against them bitterer than ever; 
For pantisocracy he once had cried 
  Aloud, a scheme less moral than 'twas clever; 
Then grew a hearty anti-Jacobin — 
Had turn'd his coat — and would have turn'd his skin. 

XCVIII 

He had sung against all battles, and again 
  In their high praise and glory; he had call'd 
Reviewing ('the ungentle craft,' and then 
  Become as base a critic as e'er crawl'd — 
Fed, paid, and pamper'd by the very men 
  By whom his muse and morals had been maul'd: 
He had written much blank verse, and blanker prose, 
And more of both than anybody knows. 

XCIX 

He had written Wesley's life: — here turning round 
  To Satan, 'Sir, I'm ready to write yours, 
In two octavo volumes, nicely bound, 
  With notes and preface, all that most allures 
The pious purchaser; and there's no ground 
  For fear, for I can choose my own reviews: 
So let me have the proper documents, 
That I may add you to my other saints.' 

C 

Satan bow'd, and was silent. 'Well, if you, 
  With amiable modesty, decline 
My offer, what says Michael? There are few 
  Whose memoirs could be render'd more divine. 
Mine is a pen of all work; not so new 
  As it once was, but I would make you shine 
Like your own trumpet. By the way, my own 
Has more of brass in it, and is as well blown. 

CI 

'But talking about trumpets, here's my Vision! 
  Now you shall judge, all people; yes, you shall 
Judge with my judgment, and by my decision 
  Be guided who shall enter heaven or fall. 
I settle all these things by intuition, 
  Times present, past, to come, heaven, hell, and all, 
Like King Alfonso(. When I thus see double, 
I save the Deity some worlds of trouble.' 

CII 

He ceased, and drew forth an MS.; and no 
  Persuasion on the part of devils, saints, 
Or angels, now could stop the torrent; so 
  He read the first three lines of the contents; 
But at the fourth, the whole spiritual show 
  Had vanish'd, with variety of scents, 
Ambrosial and sulphureous, as they sprang, 
Like lightning, off from his 'melodious twang.' ( 

CIII 

Those grand heroics acted as a spell: 
  The angels stopp'd their ears and plied their pinions; 
The devils ran howling, deafen'd, down to hell; 
  The ghosts fled, gibbering, for their own dominions — 
(For 'tis not yet decided where they dwell, 
  And I leave every man to his opinions); 
Michael took refuge in his trump — but, lo! 
His teeth were set on edge, he could not blow! 

CIV 

Saint Peter, who has hitherto been known 
  For an impetuous saint, upraised his keys, 
And at the fifth line knock'd the poet down; 
  Who fell like Phaeton, but more at ease, 
Into his lake, for there he did not drown; 
  A different web being by the Destinies 
Woven for the Laureate's final wreath, whene'er 
Reform shall happen either here or there. 

CV 

He first sank to the bottom - like his works, 
  But soon rose to the surface — like himself; 
For all corrupted things are bouy'd like corks,( 
  By their own rottenness, light as an elf, 
Or wisp that flits o'er a morass: he lurks, 
  It may be, still, like dull books on a shelf, 
In his own den, to scrawl some 'Life' or 'Vision,' 
As Welborn says — 'the devil turn'd precisian.' 

CVI 

As for the rest, to come to the conclusion 
  Of this true dream, the telescope is gone 
Which kept my optics free from all delusion, 
  And show'd me what I in my turn have shown; 
All I saw farther, in the last confusion, 
  Was, that King George slipp'd into heaven for one; 
And when the tumult dwindled to a calm, 
I left him practising the hundredth psalm. 




Slowly up silent peaks, the white edge of the world,
Trod four archangels, clear against the unheeding sky, 
Bearing, with quiet even steps, and great wings furled, 
A little dingy coffin; where a child must lie, 
Have bidden a child turn from the spring and the sunlight,
And shut him in that lonely shell, to drop for ever 
Into the emptiness and silence, into the night



They then from the sheer summit cast, and watched it fall, 
Through unknown glooms, that frail black coffin—and therein
And curled up like some crumpled, lonely flower petal— 
Till it was no more visible; then turned again 
With sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain. 

Silent is the house: all are laid asleep:  
One alone looks out o’er the snow-wreaths deep,  
Watching every cloud, dreading every breeze  
That whirls the wildering drift, and bends the groaning trees.  
 
Cheerful is the hearth, soft the matted floor;          
Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or door;  
The little lamp burns straight, its rays shoot strong and far:  
I trim it well, to be the wanderer’s guiding-star.  
 
Frown, my haughty sire! chide, my angry dame!  
Set your slaves to spy; threaten me with shame:         
But neither sire nor dame nor prying serf shall know,  
What angel nightly tracks that waste of frozen snow.  
 
What I love shall come like visitant of air,  
Safe in secret power from lurking human snare;  
What loves me, no word of mine shall e’er betray,        
Though for faith unstained my life must forfeit pay.  
 
Burn, then, little lamp; glimmer straight and clear—  
Hush! a rustling wing stirs, methinks, the air:  
He for whom I wait, thus ever comes to me;  
Strange Power! I trust thy might; trust thou my constancy. 




If fortune had not granted me
      To suck the Muse's teats,
I think I would have liked to be
      A sweeper of the streets;
And city gutters glad to groom,
      Have heft a bonny broom.
 
There--as amid the crass and crush
      The limousines swished by,
I would have leaned upon my brush
      With visionary eye:
Deeming despite their loud allure
      That I was rich, they poor.

Aye, though in garb terrestrial,
      To Heaven I would pray,
And dream with broom celestial
      I swept the Milky Way;
And golden chariots would ring,
      And harps of Heaven sing.

And all the strumpets passing me,
      And heelers of the Ward
Would glorified Madonnas be,
And all the brats in gutters grim
      Be rosy cherubim. 



Oh! lend that lute, sweet Archimage, to me!
Enough of care and heaviness
The weary lids of life depress,
And doubly blest that gentle heart shall be,
That wooes of poesy the visions bland,
And strays forgetful o'er enchanted land!
Oh! lend that lute, sweet Archimage, to me!
So spoke, with ardent look, yet eyebrow sad,
When he had passed o'er many a mountain rude,
And many a wild and weary solitude, 
'Mid a green vale, a wandering minstrel-lad.
With eyes that shone in softened flame,
With wings and wand, young Fancy came;
And as she touched a trembling lute,
The lone enthusiast stood entranced and mute.
It was a sound that made his soul forego
All thoughts of sadness in a world of woe.
Oh, lend that lute! he cried: Hope, Pity, Love,
Shall listen; and each valley, rock, and grove,
Shall witness, as with deep delight, 
From orient morn to dewy-stealing night.
My spirit, rapt in trance of sweetness high,
Shall drink the heartfelt sound with tears of ecstasy!
As thus he spoke, soft voices seemed to say,
Come away, come away;
Where shall the heart-sick minstrel stray,
But (viewing all things like a dream)
By haunted wood, or wizard stream?
That, like a hermit weeping,
Amid the gray stones creeping; 
With voice distinct, yet faint,
Calls on Repose herself to hear its soothing plaint.
For him, romantic Solitude
Shall pile sublime her mountains rude;
For him, with shades more soft impressed,
The lucid lake's transparent breast
Shall show the banks, the woods, the hill,
More clear, more beautiful, more still.
For him more musical shall wave
The pines o'er Echo's moonlit cave; 
While sounds as of a fairy lyre
Amid the shadowy cliffs expire!
This valley where the raptured minstrel stood
Was shaded with a circling slope of wood,
And rich in beauty, with that valley vied,
Thessalian Tempe, crowned with verdant bay,
Where smooth and clear Peneus winds his way;
And Ossa and Olympus, on each side,
Rise dark with woods; or that Sicilian plain
Which Arethusa's clearest waters lave, 
By many a haunt of Pan, and wood-nymph's cave,
Lingering and listening to the Doric strain
Of him, the bard whose music might succeed
To the wild melodies of Pan's own reed!
This scene the mistress of the valley held,
Fancy, a magic maid; and at her will,
Aerial castles crowned the gleaming hill,
Or forests rose, or lapse of water welled.
Sometimes she sat with lifted eye,
And marked the dark storm in the western sky; 
Sometimes she looked, and scarce her breath would draw,
As fearful things, not to be told, she saw;
And sometimes, like a vision of the air,
On wings of shifting light she floated here and there.
In the breeze her garments flew,
Of the brightest skiey blue,
Lucid as the tints of morn,
When Summer trills his pipe of corn:
Her tresses to each wing descending fall,
Or, lifted by the wind, 
Stream loose and unconfined,
Like golden threads, beneath her myrtle coronal.
The listening passions stood aloof and mute,
As oft the west wind touched her trembling lute.
But when its sounds the youthful minstrel heard,
Strange mingled feelings, not to be expressed,
Rose undefined, yet blissful, on his breast,
And all the softened scene in sweeter light appeared.
Then Fancy waved her wand, and loCome, from toil and worldly woe;
Come, live with us in vales remote! they cry.
These are the flitting phantasies; the dreams
That lead the heart through all that elfin land,
Where half-seen shapes entice with whispers bland.
Meantime the clouds, impressed with livelier beams,
Roll, in the lucid track of air,
Arrayed in coloured brede, with semblances more fair.
The airy troop, as on they sail,
Thus the pensive stranger hail: 
In the pure and argent sky,
There our distant chambers lie;
The bed is strewed with blushing roses,
When Quietude at eve reposes,
Oft trembling lest her bowers should fade,
In the cold earth's humid shade.
Come, rest with us! evanishing, they cried--
Come, rest with us! the lonely vale replied.
Then Fancy beckoned, and with smiling mien,
Of Beauty: from her eye divinely bright,
A richer lustre shot, a more attractive light.
She said: With fairer tints I can adorn
The living landscape, fairer than the morn.
The summer clouds in shapes romantic rolled,
And those they edge the fading west, like gold;
The lake that sleeps in sunlight, yet impressed
With shades more sweet than real on its breast;
'Mid baffling stones, beneath a partial ray,
The small brook huddling its uneven way; 
The blue far distant hills, the silvery sea,
And every scene of summer speaks of me:
But most I wake the sweetest wishes warm,
Where the fond gaze is turned on woman's breathing form.
So passing silent through a myrtle grove,
Beauty first led him to the bower of Love.
A mellow light through the dim covert strayed,
And opening roses canopied the shade.
Why does the hurrying pulse unbidden leap!
Behold, in yonder glade that nymph asleep! 
The heart-struck minstrel hangs, with lingering gaze,
O'er every charm his eye impassioned strays!
An edge of white is seen, and scarcely seen,
As soft she breathes, her coral lips between;
A lambent ray steals from her half-closed eye,
As her breast heaves a short imperfect sigh.
Sleep, winds of summer, o'er the leafy bower,
Nor move the light bells of the nodding flower;
Lest but a sound of stirring leaves might seem
To break the charm of her delicious dream! 
And ye, fond, rising, throbbing thoughts, away,
Lest syren Pleasure all the soul betray!
Oh! turn, and listen to the ditty
From the lowly cave of Pity.
On slaughter's plain, while Valour grieves,
There he sunk to rest,
And the ring-dove scattered leaves
Upon his bleeding breast!
Her face was hid, while her pale arms enfold
What seemed an urn of alabaster cold; 
To this she pressed her heaving bosom bare:
The drops that gathered in the dank abode
Fell dripping, on her long dishevelled hair;
And still her tears, renewed, and silent, flowed:
And when the winds of autumn ceased to swell,
At times was heard a slow and melancholy knell!
'Twas in the twilight of the deepest wood,
Beneath whose boughs like sad Cocytus, famed
Through fabling Greece, from lamentation named
A river dark and silent flowed, there stood 
A pale and melancholy man, intent
His look upon that drowsy stream he bent,
As ever counting, when the fitful breeze
With strange and hollow sound sung through the trees,
Counting the sallow leaves, that down the current went.
He saw them not:
Earth seemed to him one universal blot.
Sometimes, as most distempered, to and fro
He paced; and sometimes fixed his chilling look
Upon a dreadful book, 
Inscribed with secret characters of woe;
While gibbering imps, as mocking him, appeared,
And airy laughter 'mid the dusk was heard.
Then Fancy waved her wand again,
And all that valley that so lovely smiled
Was changed to a bare champaign, waste and wild.
'What pale and phantom-horseman rides amain?'
'Tis Terror;--all the plain, far on, is spread
With skulls and bones, and relics of the dead!
From his black trump he blew a louder blast, 
And earthquakes muttered as the giant passed.
Then said that magic maid, with aspect bland,
'Tis thine to seize his phantom spear,
'Tis thine his sable trumpet to command,
And thrill the inmost heart with shuddering fear.
But hark! to Music's softer sound,
New scenes and fairer views accordant rise:
Above, around,
The mingled measure swells in air, and dies.
Music, in thy charmed shell, 
What sounds of holy magic dwell!
Oft when that shell was to the ear applied,
Confusion of rich harmonies,
All swelling rose,
That came, as with a gently-swelling tide:
Then at the close,
Angelic voices seemed, aloft,
To answer as it died the cadence soft.
Now, like the hum of distant ocean's stream,
The murmurs of the wond'rous concave seem; 
And now exultingly their tones prolong
The chorded paeans of the choral song,
Then Music, with a voice more wildly sweet
Than winds that pipe on the forsaken shore,
When the last rain-drops of the west are o'er,
Warbled: Oh, welcome to my blest retreat,
And give my sounds to the responsive lyre:
With me to these melodious groves retire,
And such pure feelings share,
As, far from noise and folly, soothe thee there. 
Here Fancy, as the prize were won,
And now she hailed her favourite son,
With energy impatient cried:
The weary world is dark and wide,
Lo! I am with thee still to comfort and to guide.
Nor fear, if, grim before thine eyes,
Pale worldly Want, a spectre, lowers;
What is a world of vanities
To a world as sweet as ours!
When thy heart is sad and lone, 
And loves to dwell on pleasures flown,
When that heart no more shall bound
At some kind voice's well-known sound,
My spells thy drooping languor shall relieve,
And airy spirits touch thy lonely harp at eve.
Look!--Delight and Hope advancing,
Music joins her thrilling notes,
O'er the level lea come dancing;
Seize the vision as it floats,
Bright-eyed Rapture hovers o'er them, 
Waving light his seraph wings,
Youth exulting flies before them,
Scattering cowslips as he sings!
Come now, my car pursue,
The wayward Fairy cried;
And high amid the fields of air,
Above the clouds, together we will ride,
And posting on the viewless winds,
So leave the cares of earth and all its thoughts behind.
I can sail, and I can fly, 
To all regions of the sky,
On the shooting meteor's course,
On a winged griffin-horse!
She spoke: when Wisdom's self drew nigh,
A noble sternness in her searching eye;
Like Pallas helmed, and in her hand a spear,
As not in idle warfare bent, but still,
As resolute, to cope with every earthly ill.
In youthful dignity severe,
She stood: And shall the aspiring mind, 
To Fancy be alone resigned!
Alas! she cried, her witching lay
Too often leads the heart astray!
Still, weak minstrel, wouldst thou rove,
Drooping in the distant grove,
Forgetful of all ties that bind
Thee, a brother, to mankind?
Has Fancy's feeble voice defied
The ills to poor humanity allied?
Can she, like Wisdom, bid thy soul sustain 
Its post of duty in a life of pain!
Can she, like meek Religion, bid thee bear
Contempt and hardship in a world of care!
In all, her blameless witchery,
Or from the languid bosom tear
Each sweet illusion nourished there.
With dignity and truth, combined,
Still may she rule the manly mind;
Her sweetest magic still impart 
To soften, not subdue, the heart:
Still may she warm the chosen breast,
Not as the sovereign, but the guest.
Then shall she lead the blameless Muse
Through all her fairest, wildest views;
To mark amid the flowers of morn,
The bee go forth with early horn;
Or when the moon, a softer light
Sheds on the rocks and seas of night,
To hear the circling fairy bands 
Sing, Come unto these yellow sands!
Sweeter is our light than day,
Fond enthusiast, come away!
Then Chivalry again shall call
The champions to her bannered hall!
The pipe, and song, with many a mingled shout,
Ring through the forest, as the satyr-rout,
Dance round the dragon-chariot of Romance;
Forth pricks the errant knight with rested lance;
Imps, demons, fays, in antic train succeed, 
The wandering maiden, and the winged steed!
The muttering wizard turns, with haggard look,
The bloody leaves of the accursed book,
Whilst giants, from the gloomy castle tower,
With lifted bats of steel, more dreadful lower!
At times, the magic shall prevail
Of the wild and wonderous tale;
At times, high rapture shall prolong
The deep, enthusiastic song.
Hence, at midnight, thou shalt stray, 
Where dark ocean flings its spray,
To hear o'er heaven's resounding arch
Or mark the flashes, that present
Some far-off shattered monument;
Whilst along the rocky vale,
Red fires, mingled with the hail,
Run along upon the ground,
And the thunders deeper sound!
The loftier Muse, with awful mien, 
Upon a lonely rock is seen:
Full is the eye that speaks the dauntless soul;
She seems to hear the gathering tempest roll
Beneath her feet; she bids an eagle fly,
Breasting the whirlwind, through the dark-red sky;
Or, with elated look, lifts high the spear,
As sounds of distant battles roll more near.
Now deep-hushed in holy trance,
She sees the powers of Heaven advance,
And wheels, instinct with spirit, bear 
Now on the wings of morn she seems to rise,
And join the strain of more than mortal harmonies.
Thy heart shall beat exulting as she sings,
And thou shalt cry: Give me an angel's wings!
With sadder sound, o'er Pity's cave,
The willow in the wind shall wave;
And all the listening passions stand, 
Obedient to thy great command.
With Poesy's sweet charm impressed,
Fancy thus shall warm thy breast;
Still her smiling train be thine,
Still her lovely visions shine,
To cheer, beyond my boasted power,
A sad or solitary hour.
Thus let them soothe a while thy heart,
'Come like shadows, so depart;'
But never may the witching lay
Lead each sense from life astray;
For vain the poet's muse of fire, 
Vain the magic of his lyre,
Unless the touch subdued impart
Truth and wisdom to the heart


Sad lot, to have no Hope! Though lowly kneeling
He fain would frame a prayer within his breast,
Would fain entreat for some sweet breath of healing,
That his sick body might have ease and rest;
He strove in vain! the dull sighs from his chest
Against his will the stifling load revealing,
Though Nature forced; though like some captive guest,
Some royal prisoner at his conqueror's feast,
An alien's restless mood but half concealing,
The sternness on his gentle brow confessed,
Sickness within and miserable feeling:
Though obscure pangs made curses of his dreams,
And dreaded sleep, each night repelled in vain,
Each night was scattered by its own loud screams:
Yet never could his heart command, though fain,
One deep full wish to be no more in pain.
That Hope, which was his inward bliss and boast,
Which waned and died, yet ever near him stood,
Though changed in nature, wander where he would--
For Love's Despair is but Hope's pining Ghost!
For this one hope he makes his hourly moan,
He wishes and can wish for this alone!
Pierced, as with light from Heaven, before its gleams
(So the love-stricken visionary deems)
Disease would vanish, like a summer shower,
Whose dews fling sunshine from the noon-tide bower!
Or let it stay! yet this one Hope should give
Such strength that he would bless his pains and live. 



I.

As by his lonely hearth he sate, 
The shadow of a welcome dream 
Pass'd o'er his heart,--disconsolate 
His home did seem; 
Comfort in vain was spread around, 
For something still was wanting found. 

II.

Therefore he thought of one who might 
For ever in his presence stay; 
Whose dream should be of him by night, 
Whose smile should be for him by day; 
And the sweet vision, vague and far, 
Rose on his fancy like a star. 

III.

'Let her be young, yet not a child, 
Whose light and inexperienced mirth 
Is all too winged and too wild 
For sober earth,-- 
Too rainbow-like such mirth appears, 
And fades away in misty tears.

IV.

'Let youth's fresh rose still gently bloom 
Upon her smooth and downy cheek, 
Yet let a shadow, not of gloom, 
But soft and meek, 
Tell that some sorrow she hath known, 
Tho' not a sorrow of her own. 

V.

'And let her eyes be of the grey, 
The soft grey of the brooding dove, 
Full of the sweet and tender ray 
Of modest love; 
For fonder shows that dreamy hue 
Than lustrous black or heavenly blue. 

VI.

'Let her be full of quiet grace, 
No sparkling wit with sudden glow 
Bright'ning her purely chisell'd face 
And placid brow; 
Not radiant to the stranger's eye,-- 
A creature easily pass'd by; 

VII.

'But who, once seen, with untold power 
For ever haunts the yearning heart, 
Raised from the crowd that self-same hour 
To dwell apart, 
All sainted and enshrined to be 
The idol of our memory! 

VIII.

'And oh! let Mary be her name 
It hath a sweet and gentle sound 
At which no glories dear to fame 
Come crowding round, 
But which the dreaming heart beguiles 
With holy thoughts and household smiles 

IX.

'With peaceful meetings, welcomes kind, 
And love, the same in joy and tears, 
And gushing intercourse of mind 
Thro' faithful years; 
Oh! dream of something half divine, 
Be real--be mortal--and be mine!'




we have no patience to wait
the mechanics move too slow for us
it’s as much as anything
but the chance not to give up. 

the steps that take us
to the dawn of the morning sun
floats faster as debris
runs over the shadow of time. 

the man you talked
is not the man we saw
we are guests in their strange land
good quality is not found in the row.



Never, believe me,
Appear the Immortals,
Never alone:
Scarce had I welcomed the Sorrow-beguiler,
Iacchus! but in came Boy Cupid the Smiler;
Lo! Phoebus the Glorious descends from his throne!
They advance, they float in, the Olympians all!
With Divinities fills my
Terrestrial hall!

How shall I yield you
Due entertainment,
Celestial quire?
Me rather, bright guests! with your wings of upbuoyance
Bear aloft to your homes, to your banquets of joyance,
That the roofs of Olympus may echo my lyre!
Hah! we mount! on their pinions they waft up my soul!
O give me the nectar!
O fill me the bowl!

Give him the nectar!
Pour out for the poet,
Hebe! pour free!
Quicken his eyes with celestial dew,
That Styx the detested no more he may view,
Thanks, Hebe! I quaff it! Io Paean, I cry!
The wine of the Immortals
Forbids me to die


it came today to visit
and moved into the house
it was smaller than an elephant
but larger than a mouse

first it slapped my sister
then it kicked my dad
then it pushed my mother
oh! that really made me mad

it went and tickled rover
and terrified the cat
it sliced apart my necktie
and rudely crushed my hat

it smeared my head with honey
and filled the tub with rocks
and when i yelled in anger
it stole my shoes and socks

that's just the way it happened
it happened all today
before it bowed politely
and softly went away


In Spanish he whispers there is no time left. 
It is the sound of scythes arcing in wheat,
the ache of some field song in Salvador.
The wind along the prison, cautious
as Francisco's hands on the inside, touching 
the walls as he walks, it is his wife's breath
slipping into his cell each night while he
imagines his hand to be hers.  It is a small country.

There is nothing one man will not do to another. 

Down the hill, in the field of sweet alfalfa, they're
     freezing each other, the children

playing tag and I'm up at the house, I'm
in the picture window, thin
and distant like the glimpse

of a surfacing fish. What dark waters
the house is, behind me, settling
into evening. Dusk

and there are, of course, fireflies. Tell me, 
what was your name? When you visited once, 

by the backroad where the stones glowed pale
in the moonlight, I was too young, I still thought
I belonged to the world. But now

quartered in this house, watching the neighbors' children 
turn to dusk, I feel
I'm ready. Come back

and bring your finest wine, the oldest bottle.
Bring that strange dusty book you were reading. 

A wearied visitor down upon my house
The stove is warm
Utensils clang
our mouths watered
And the gander relished
What the goose ate. 



I was the height of a folio, my bed just 
backed on the bookcases’ sombre Babel, 
everything, Latin ashes, Greek dust
jumbled together: novel, science, fable.
Two voices spoke to me. One, firmly, slyly,
said: ‘The Earth’s a cake filled with sweetness:
I can give you (and your pleasure will be
endless!) an appetite of comparable vastness.’
The other said: ‘Come! Come voyage in dream,
beyond the known, beyond the possible!’
And that one sang like the ocean breeze,
phantom, from who knows where, its wail
caressing the ear, and yet still frightening.
You I answered: ‘Yes! Gentle voice!’ My
wound and what, I’d call my fatality, begins
alas, from then. From behind the scenery
of vast existence, in voids without light,
I see the strangest worlds distinctly:
ecstatic victim of my second sight,
snakes follow me striking at my feet.
Since then, like the prophets, I greet
the desert and the sea with tenderness:
I laugh at funerals, I cry at feasts,
wine tastes smooth that’s full of bitterness:
and, eyes on the sky, I fall into holes,
and frequently I take facts for lies.
But ‘Keep your dreams!’ the Voice consoles,
‘Madmen have sweeter ones than the wise!’Safe in the magic of my woods
I lay, and watched the dying light.
Faint in the pale high solitudes,
And washed with rain and veiled by night,

Silver and blue and green were showing.
And the dark woods grew darker still;
And birds were hushed; and peace was growing;
And quietness crept up the hill;

And no wind was blowing

And I knew
That this was the hour of knowing,
And the night and the woods and you
Were one together, and I should find
Soon in the silence the hidden key
Of all that had hurt and puzzled me --
Why you were you, and the night was kind,
And the woods were part of the heart of me.

And there I waited breathlessly,
Alone; and slowly the holy three,
The three that I loved, together grew
One, in the hour of knowing,
Night, and the woods, and you ----

And suddenly
There was an uproar in my woods,

The noise of a fool in mock distress,
Crashing and laughing and blindly going,
Of ignorant feet and a swishing dress,
And a Voice profaning the solitudes.

The spell was broken, the key denied me
And at length your flat clear voice beside me
Mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes.

You came and quacked beside me in the wood.
You said, "The view from here is very good!"
You said, "It's nice to be alone a bit!"
And, "How the days are drawing out!" you said.
You said, "The sunset's pretty, isn't it?"


So like a flower and a current of air
the flow of water fleeting shadows
the smile glimpsed at midnight this excellent evening
so like every joy and every sadness
it is the midnight past lifting its naked body above belfries and poplars
I call to me those lost in the fields
old skeletons young oaks cut down
scraps of cloth rotting on the ground and linen drying in farm country
I call tornadoes and hurricanes
storms typhoons cyclones
tidal waves
earthquakes
I call the smoke of volcanoes and the smoke of cigarettes
the rings of smoke from expensive cigars
I call lovers and loved ones
I call the living and the dead
I call gravediggers I call assassins
I call hangmen pilots bricklayers architects
assassins
I call the flesh
I call the one I love
I call the one I love
I call the one I love
the jubilant midnight unfolds its satin wings and perches on my bed
the belfries and the poplars bend to my wish
the former collapse the latter bow down
those lost in the fields are found in finding me
the old skeletons are revived by my voice
the young oaks cut down are covered with foliage
the scraps of cloth rotting on the ground and in the earth
	snap to at the sound of my voice like a flag of rebellion
the linen drying in farm country clothes adorable women 
	whom I do not adore
who come to me
obeying my voice, adoring
tornadoes revolve in my mouth
hurricanes if it is possible redden my lips
storms roar at my feet
typhoons if it is possible ruffle me
I get drunken kisses from the cyclones
the tidal waves come to die at my feet
the earthquakes do not shake me but fade completely
	at my command
the smoke of volcanoes clothes me with its vapors
and the smoke of cigarettes perfumes me
and the rings of cigar smoke crown me
loves and love so long hunted find refuge in me
lovers listen to my voice
the living and the dead yield to me and salute me
	the former coldly the latter warmly
the gravediggers abandon the hardly-dug graves
	and declare that I alone may command their nightly work
the assassins greet me
the hangmen invoke the revolution
invoke my voice
invoke my name
the pilots are guided by my eyes
the bricklayers are dizzied listening to me
the architects leave for the desert
the assassins bless me
flesh trembles when I call

the one I love is not listening
the one I love does not hear
the one I love does not answer. 

Youth of delight, come hither,
And see the opening morn,
Image of truth new born.
Doubt is fled, & clouds of reason,
Dark disputes & artful teazing.
Folly is an endless maze,
Tangled roots perplex her ways.
How many have fallen there!
They stumble all night over bones of the dead,
And feel they know not what but care,
And wish to lead others, when they should be led. 

is not silent, it is a speaking-
out-loud voice in your head;  it is *spoken*,
a voice is *saying* it
as you read.  It's the writer's words,
of course, in a literary sense
his or her 'voice' but the sound
of that voice is the sound of *your* voice.
Not the sound your friends know
or the sound of a tape played back
but your voice
caught in the dark cathedral
of your skull, your voice heard
by an internal ear informed by internal abstracts
and what you know by feeling,
having felt.  It is your voice
saying, for example, the word 'barn'
that the writer wrote
but the 'barn' you say
is a barn you know or knew.  The voice
in your head, speaking as you read,
never says anything neutrally- some people
hated the barn they knew,
some people love the barn they know
so you hear the word loaded
and a sensory constellation
is lit:  horse-gnawed stalls,
hayloft, black heat tape wrapping
a water pipe, a slippery
spilled *chirr* of oats from a split sack,
the bony, filthy haunches of cows. 
And 'barn' is only a noun- no verb
or subject has entered into the sentence yet!
The voice you hear when you read to yourself
is the clearest voice:  you speak it
speaking to you. 

The rich and fortunate do well to keep silent,
for no one cares to know who and what they are.
But those in need must reveal themselves,
must say: I am blind,
or: I'm on the verge of going blind,
or: nothing goes well with me on earth,
or: I have a sickly child,
or: I have little to hold me together. 


And chances are this is not nearly enough.

And because people try to ignore them as they
pass by them: these unfortunate ones have to sing!

And at times one hears some excellent singing!

Of course, people differ in their tastes: some would
prefer to listen to choirs of boy-castrati.

when the castrati's singing disturbs Him.

of ancient drumbeats



There's no one here but me
yet i can hear some people talk
they are here
they are not there
are they no where? 
no
they are some where
they are floating in my head
the names they call me
the things they say! 
i just wanna get away from it all


Pascal had his Void that went with him day and night.
- Alas! It’s all Abyss, - action, longing, dream,
the Word! And I feel Panic’s storm-wind stream
through my hair, and make it stand upright.
Above, below, around, the desert, the deep,
the silence, the fearful compelling spaces. 
a multi-formed nightmare without release.
I fear sleep as one fears a deep hole,
full of vague terror. Where to, who knows?
I see only infinity at every window,
and my spirit haunted by vertigo’s stress
envies the stillness of Nothingness.
- Ah! Never to escape from Being and Number



Sixty minutes, like any other
       Hour
    throughout the year, we

all live & Breath, Love &
       hate, work &
    idle, eat sleep burp

fart shit & rot as on
       our best &
    worst day, unwinding from

the clock in that ancient
       order accepted in
    the first, second, &

third worlds, a tacitly absorbed 
    imposition on
circadian rhythms &

munchin', snoozin', pooping, loving


 
           ~~simply passing~~

in hopes of saving an hour of
    daylight like a dime
    bank, nor the annals of time. 

Sez I: My Country calls? Well, let it call.
    I grins perlitely and declines wiv thanks.
Go, let 'em plaster every blighted wall,
    'Ere's ONE they don't stampede into the ranks.
Them politicians with their greasy ways;
    Them empire-grabbers -- fight for 'em? No fear!
I've seen this mess a-comin' from the days
    Of Algyserious and Aggydear:
        I've felt me passion rise and swell,
        But . . . wot the 'ell, Bill? Wot the 'ell?

Sez I: My Country? Mine? I likes their cheek.
    Me mud-bespattered by the cars they drive,
Wot makes my measly thirty bob a week,
    And sweats red blood to keep meself alive!
Fight for the right to slave that they may spend,
    Them in their mansions, me 'ere in my slum?
No, let 'em fight wot's something to defend:
    But me, I've nothin' -- let the Kaiser come.
        And so I cusses 'ard and well,
        But . . . wot the 'ell, Bill? Wot the 'ell?

Sez I: If they would do the decent thing,
    And shield the missis and the little 'uns,
    And face the chances of them 'ungry guns.
But we've got three, another on the way;
    It's that wot makes me snarl and set me jor:
The wife and nippers, wot of 'em, I say,
    If I gets knocked out in this blasted war?
        Gets proper busted by a shell,
        But . . . wot the 'ell, Bill? Wot the 'ell?

Ay, wot the 'ell's the use of all this talk?
    To-day some boys in blue was passin' me,
And some of 'em they 'ad no legs to walk,
    And some of 'em they 'ad no eyes to see.
And -- well, I couldn't look 'em in the face,
    And so I'm goin', goin' to declare
I'm under forty-one and take me place
    To face the music with the bunch out there.
        A fool, you say! Maybe you're right.
        I'll 'ave no peace unless I fight.
        I've ceased to think; I only know
        I've gotta go, Bill, gotta go. 


The gull shall whistle in his wake, the blind wave break in fire,
And he shall see old planets pass and alien stars arise,
And give the gale his seaworn sail in shadow of new skies.
Strong lust of gear shall drive him forth and hunger arm his hand
To win his food from the desert rude, his foothold from the sand.
His neighbors' smoke shall vex his eyes, their voices break his rest,
He shall go forth till South is North, sullen and dispossessed.
He shall desire loneliness, and his desire shall bring
Hard on his heels a thousand wheels, a People, and a King;
He shall come back in his own track, and by his scarce cooled camp;
There shall he meet the roaring street, the derrick, and the stamp;
There he shall blaze a nation's ways with hatchet and with brand,
Till on his last-won wilderness an Empire's outposts stand


Today i take the vow to love you
To behold you 
And to cherish you
When i look straight into your eyes
I see the truthfulness in you
Without a blink 
Your eyes emit assurance 

Eyes speak much about love
And that is what your eyes have spoken to my heart
Our past may not be as white as linen
But our tomorrow dictates we live today
For yesterday is gone 
Let us stick to the message of our eyes

We promise to be human
For human beings don't mask emotions
You will see my sad emotions through
The same eyes that you now see love emotions
Together we shall handle all emotions
Let your eyes be the window to my life with you
For guilty eyes look away

Unfaithful eyes will never meet faithful eyes
Allow me to read your eyes
Not your voice 
For me to understand the depth of love
through the inner eyes is us 
For today i take the vow
To love, behold and cherish you


Just the day, 
comes, 
with an iron will, 
the way to conquer the passions, 
standing strong for the will, 
droned by half hearted gestures, 
and sick blood, 
heated to warm, 
inhabiting the frozen hope, 
Clenched jaw, 
over the aggressions, 
a defeated wish, 
to surrender, 
famous faces, 
staring sky, , 
the voyage, 
with design of numbness, 
against the howling winds, 
and in deep waters. 


Oh, glorious are the guarded heights
  Where guardian souls abide--
Self-exiled from our gross delights--
  Above, beyond, outside:
An ampler arc their spirit swings--
  Commands a juster view--
We have their word for all these things,
   No doubt their words are true.

Yet we, the bond slaves of our day,
  Whom dirt and danger press--
Co-heirs of insolence,  delay,
  And leagued unfaithfulness--
Such is our need must seek indeed
  And, having found, engage
The men who merely do the work
  For which they draw the wage.

From forge and farm and mine and bench,
  Deck, altar, outpost lone--
Mill, school, battalion, counter, trench,
  Rail, senate, sheepfold, throne--
Creation's cry goes up on high
  From age to cheated age:
"Send us the men who do the work
   "For which they draw the wage!"

Words cannot help nor wit achieve,
   Nor e'en the all-gifted fool,
Too weak to enter, bide, or leave
  The lists he cannot rule.
Beneath the sun we count on none
  Our evil to assuage,
Except the men that do the work
  For which they draw the wage.

When through the Gates of Stress and Strain
  Comes forth the vast Event--
The simple, sheer, sufficing, sane
  Result of labour spent--
They that have wrought the end unthought
  Be neither saint nor sage,
But only men who did the work
  For which they drew the wage.

Wherefore to these the Fates shall bend
  (And all old idle things )
Werefore on these shall Power attend
  Beyond the grip of kings:
Each in his place, by right, not grace,
  Shall rule his heritage--
The men who simply do the work
  For which they draw the wage.

Not such as scorn the loitering street,
  Or waste, to earth its praise,
Their noontide's unreturning heat
  About their morning ways;
But such as dower each mortgaged hour
  Alike with clean courage--
Even the men who do the work
  For which they draw the wage--
  For which they draw the wage--
Begin-continue-close that work
  For which they draw the wage!


'TIS spent--this burning day of June!
Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;
The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheeling,--
That solitary bird
Is all that can be heard
In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!



Confiding Glow-worms, 'tis a night
Propitious to your earth-born light!
But, where the scattered stars are seen
In hazy straits the clouds between, 
Each, in his station twinkling not,
Seems changed into a pallid spot.
The mountains against heaven's grave weight
Rise up, and grow to wondrous height.
The air, as in a lion's den,
Is close and hot;--and now and then
Comes a tired and sultry breeze
With a haunting and a panting,
Like the stifling of disease;
But the dews allay the heat, 
And the silence makes it sweet.
Hush, there is some one on the stir!
'Tis Benjamin the Waggoner;
Who long hath trod this toilsome way,
Companion of the night and day.
That far-off tinkling's drowsy cheer,
Mixed with a faint yet grating sound
In a moment lost and found,
The Wain announces--by whose side
Along the banks of Rydal Mere 
He paces on, a trusty Guide,--
Listen! you can scarcely hear!
Hither he his course is bending;--
Now he leaves the lower ground,
And up the craggy hill ascending
Many a stop and stay he makes,
Many a breathing-fit he takes;--
Steep the way and wearisome,
Yet all the while his whip is dumb!
The Horses have worked with right good-will, 
And so have gained the top of the hill;
He was patient, they were strong,
And now they smoothly glide along,
Recovering breath, and pleased to win
The praises of mild Benjamin.
Heaven shield him from mishap and snare!
But why so early with this prayer?--
Is it for threatenings in the sky?
Or for some other danger nigh?
No; none is near him yet, though he 
Be one of much infirmity;
For at the bottom of the brow,
Where once the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
Offered a greeting of good ale
To all who entered Grasmere Vale;
And called on him who must depart
To leave it with a jovial heart;
There, where the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
Once hung, a Poet harbours now,
A simple water-drinking Bard; 
Why need our Hero then (though frail
His best resolves) be on his guard?
He marches by, secure and bold;
Yet while he thinks on times of old,
It seems that all looks wondrous cold;
He shrugs his shoulders, shakes his head,
And, for the honest folk within,
It is a doubt with Benjamin
Whether they be alive or dead!
'Here' is no danger,--none at all! 
Beyond his wish he walks secure;
But pass a mile--and 'then' for trial,---
Then for the pride of self-denial;
If he resist that tempting door,
Which with such friendly voice will call;
If he resist those casement panes,
And that bright gleam which thence will fall
Upon his Leaders' bells and manes,
Inviting him with cheerful lure:
For still, though all be dark elsewhere, 
Some shining notice will be 'there',
Of open house and ready fare.
The place to Benjamin right well
Is known, and by as strong a spell
As used to be that sign of love
And hope--the OLIVE-BOUGH and DOVE;
He knows it to his cost, good Man!
Who does not know the famous SWAN?
Object uncouth! and yet our boast,
For it was painted by the Host; 
His own conceit the figure planned,
'Twas coloured all by his own hand;
And that frail Child of thirsty clay,
Of whom I sing this rustic lay,
Could tell with self-dissatisfaction
Quaint stories of the bird's attraction!
Well! that is past--and in despite
Of open door and shining light.
And now the conqueror essays
The long ascent of Dunmail-raise; 
And with his team is gentle here
As when he clomb from Rydal Mere;
His whip they do not dread--his voice
They only hear it to rejoice.
To stand or go is at 'their' pleasure;
Their efforts and their time they measure
By generous pride within the breast;
And, while they strain, and while they rest,
He thus pursues his thoughts at leisure.
Now am I fairly safe to-night-- 
And with proud cause my heart is light:
I trespassed lately worse than ever--
But Heaven has blest a good endeavour;
And, to my soul's content, I find
The evil One is left behind.
Yes, let my master fume and fret,
Here am I--with my horses yet!
My jolly team, he finds that ye
Will work for nobody but me!
Full proof of this the Country gained; 
It knows how ye were vexed and strained,
And forced unworthy stripes to bear,
When trusted to another's care.
Here was it--on this rugged slope,
Which now ye climb with heart and hope,
I saw you, between rage and fear,
Plunge, and fling back a spiteful ear,
And ever more and more confused,
As ye were more and more abused:
As chance would have it, passing by 
I saw you in that jeopardy:
A word from me was like a charm;
Ye pulled together with one mind;
And your huge burthen, safe from harm,
Moved like a vessel in the wind!
--Yes, without me, up hills so high
'Tis vain to strive for mastery.
Then grieve not, jolly team! though tough
The road we travel, steep, and rough;
Though Rydal-heights and Dunmail-raise, 
And all their fellow banks and braes,
Full often make you stretch and strain,
And halt for breath and halt again,
Yet to their sturdiness 'tis owing
That side by side we still are going!
While Benjamin in earnest mood
His meditations thus pursued,
A storm, which had been smothered long,
Was growing inwardly more strong;
And, in its struggles to get free, 
Was busily employed as he.
The thunder had begun to growl--
He heard not, too intent of soul;
The air was now without a breath--
He marked not that 'twas still as death.
But soon large rain-drops on his head
Fell with the weight of drops of lead;--
He starts--and takes, at the admonition,
A sage survey of his condition.
The road is black before his eyes, 
Glimmering faintly where it lies;
Black is the sky--and every hill,
Up to the sky, is blacker still--
Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room,
Hung round and overhung with gloom;
Save that above a single height
Is to be seen a lurid light,
Above Helm-crag--a streak half dead,
A burning of portentous red;
And near that lurid light, full well 
The ASTROLOGER, sage Sidrophel,
Where at his desk and book he sits,
Puzzling aloft his curious wits;
He whose domain is held in common
With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN,
Cowering beside her rifted cell,
As if intent on magic spell;--
Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,
Still sit upon Helm-crag together!
The ASTROLOGER was not unseen 
By solitary Benjamin;
But total darkness came anon,
And he and everything was gone:
And suddenly a ruffling breeze,
(That would have rocked the sounding trees
Had aught of sylvan growth been there)
Swept through the Hollow long and bare:
The rain rushed down--the road was battered,
As with the force of billows shattered;
The horses are dismayed, nor know 
Whether they should stand or go;
And Benjamin is groping near them
Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them.
He is astounded,--wonder not,--
With such a charge in such a spot;
Astounded in the mountain gap
With thunder-peals, clap after clap,
Close-treading on the silent flashes--
And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes
Among the rocks; with weight of rain, 
And sullen motions long and slow,
That to a dreary distance go--
Till, breaking in upon the dying strain,
A rending o'er his head begins the fray again.
Meanwhile, uncertain what to do,
And oftentimes compelled to halt,
The horses cautiously pursue
Their way, without mishap or fault;
And now have reached that pile of stones,
Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones; 
His who had once supreme command,
Last king of rocky Cumberland;
His bones, and those of all his Power
Slain here in a disastrous hour!
When, passing through this narrow strait,
Stony, and dark, and desolate,
Benjamin can faintly hear
A voice that comes from some one near,
A female voice--Whoe'er you be,
Stop,' it exclaimed, 'and pity me!' 
And, less in pity than in wonder,
Amid the darkness and the thunder,
The Waggoner, with prompt command,
Summons his horses to a stand.
While, with increasing agitation,
The Woman urged her supplication,
In rueful words, with sobs between--
The voice of tears that fell unseen;
There came a flash--a startling glare,
And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare! 
'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,
And Benjamin, without a question,
Taking her for some way-worn rover,
Said, 'Mount, and get you under cover!'
Another voice, in tone as hoarse
As a swoln brook with rugged course,
Cried out, 'Good brother, why so fast?
I've had a glimpse of you--'avast!'
Or, since it suits you to be civil,
Take her at once--for good and evil!' 
'It is my Husband,' softly said
The Woman, as if half afraid:
By this time she was snug within,
Through help of honest Benjamin;
She and her Babe, which to her breast
With thankfulness the Mother pressed;
And now the same strong voice more near
Said cordially, 'My Friend, what cheer?
The sky owes somebody a grudge! 
We've had in half an hour or less
A twelvemonth's terror and distress!'
Then Benjamin entreats the Man
Would mount, too, quickly as he can:
The Sailor--Sailor now no more,
But such he had been heretofore--
To courteous Benjamin replied,
'Go you your way, and mind not me;
For I must have, whate'er betide,
My Ass and fifty things beside,-- 
Go, and I'll follow speedily!'
The Waggon moves--and with its load
Descends along the sloping road;
And the rough Sailor instantly
Turns to a little tent hard by:
For when, at closing-in of day,
The family had come that way,
Green pasture and the soft warm air
Tempted them to settle there.--
Green is the grass for beast to graze, 
Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!
The Sailor gathers up his bed,
Takes down the canvas overhead;
And, after farewell to the place,
A parting word--though not of grace,
Pursues, with Ass and all his store,
The way the Waggon went before. 

THUS they, with freaks of proud delight,
Beguile the remnant of the night;
And many a snatch of jovial song
Regales them as they wind along; 
While to the music, from on high,
The echoes make a glad reply.--
But the sage Muse the revel heeds
No farther than her story needs;
Nor will she servilely attend
The loitering journey to its end.
--Blithe spirits of her own impel
The Muse, who scents the morning air,
To take of this transported pair
A brief and unreproved farewell; 
To quit the slow-paced waggon's side,
And wander down yon hawthorn dell,
With murmuring Greta for her guide.
--There doth she ken the awful form
Of Raven-crag--black as a storm--
Glimmering through the twilight pale;
And Ghimmer-crag, his tall twin brother,
Each peering forth to meet the other:--
And, while she roves through St. John's Vale,
Along the smooth unpathwayed plain, 
By sheep-track or through cottage lane,
Where no disturbance comes to intrude
Upon the pensive solitude,
Her unsuspecting eye, perchance,
With the rude shepherd's favoured glance,
Beholds the faeries in array,
Whose party-coloured garments gay
The silent company betray:
Red, green, and blue; a moment's sight!
For Skiddaw-top with rosy light 
Is touched--and all the band take flight.
--Fly also, Muse! and from the dell
Mount to the ridge of Nathdale Fell;
Thence, look thou forth o'er wood and lawn
Hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn;
Across yon meadowy bottom look,
Where close fogs hide their parent brook;
And see, beyond that hamlet small,
The ruined towers of Threlkeld-hall,
Lurking in a double shade, 
By trees and lingering twilight made!
There, at Blencathara's rugged feet,
Sir Lancelot gave a safe retreat
To noble Clifford; from annoy
Concealed the persecuted boy,
Well pleased in rustic garb to feed
His flock, and pipe on shepherd's reed
Among this multitude of hills,
Crags, woodlands, waterfalls, and rills;
Which soon the morning shall enfold, 
From east to west, in ample vest
Of massy gloom and radiance bold.
The mists, that o'er the streamlet's bed
Hung low, begin to rise and spread;
Even while I speak, their skirts of grey
Are smitten by a silver ray;
And lo!--up Castrigg's naked steep
(Where, smoothly urged, the vapours sweep
Along--and scatter and divide,
Like fleecy clouds self-multiplied) 
The stately waggon is ascending,
With faithful Benjamin attending,
Apparent now beside his team--
Now lost amid a glittering steam:
And with him goes his Sailor-friend,
By this time near their journey's end;
And, after their high-minded riot,
Sickening into thoughtful quiet;
As if the morning's pleasant hour
Had for their joys a killing power. 
And, sooth, for Benjamin a vein
Is opened of still deeper pain
As if his heart by notes were stung
From out the lowly hedge-rows flung;
As if the Warbler lost in light
Reproved his soarings of the night,
In strains of rapture pure and holy
Upbraided his distempered folly.
Drooping is he, his step is dull;
But the horses stretch and pull; 
With increasing vigour climb,
Eager to repair lost time;
Whether, by their own desert,
Knowing what cause there is for shame,
They are labouring to avert
As much as may be of the blame,
Which, they foresee, must soon alight
Upon 'his' head, whom, in despite
Of all his failings, they love best;
Whether for him they are distrest, 
Or, by length of fasting roused,
Are impatient to be housed:
Up against the hill they strain
Tugging at the iron chain,
Tugging all with might and main,
Last and foremost, every horse
To the utmost of his force!
And the smoke and respiration,
Rising like an exhalation,
Blend with the mist--a moving shroud 
To form, an undissolving cloud;
Which, with slant ray, the merry sun
Takes delight to play upon.
Never golden-haired Apollo,
Pleased some favourite chief to follow
Through accidents of peace or war,
In a perilous moment threw
Around the object of his care
Veil of such celestial hue;
Interposed so bright a screen-- 
Him and his enemies between!
Alas! what boots it?--who can hide,
When the malicious Fates are bent
On working out an ill intent?
Can destiny be turned aside?
No--sad progress of my story!
Benjamin, this outward glory
Cannot shield thee from thy Master,
Who from Keswick has pricked forth,
Sour and surly as the north; 
And, in fear of some disaster,
Comes to give what help he may,
And to hear what thou canst say;
If, as needs he must forebode,
Thou hast been loitering on the road!
His fears, his doubts, may now take flight--
The wished-for object is in sight;
Yet, trust the Muse, it rather hath
Stirred him up to livelier wrath;
Which he stifles, moody man! 
With all the patience that he can;
To the end that, at your meeting,
He may give thee decent greeting.
There he is--resolved to stop,
Till the waggon gains the top;
But stop he cannot--must advance:
Him Benjamin, with lucky glance,
Espies--and instantly is ready,
Self-collected, poised, and steady:
And, to be the better seen, 
Issues from his radiant shroud,
From his close-attending cloud,
With careless air and open mien.
Erect his port, and firm his going;
So struts yon cock that now is crowing;
And the morning light in grace
Strikes upon his lifted face,
Hurrying the pallid hue away
That might his trespasses betray.
But what can all avail to clear him, 
Or what need of explanation,
Parley or interrogation?
For the Master sees, alas!
That unhappy Figure near him,
Limping o'er the dewy grass,
Where the road it fringes, sweet,
Soft and cool to way-worn feet;
And, O indignity! an Ass,
By his noble Mastiff's side,
Tethered to the waggon's tail: 
And the ship, in all her pride,
Following after in full sail!
Not to speak of babe and mother;
Who, contented with each other,
And snug as birds in leafy arbour,
Find, within, a blessed harbour!
With eager eyes the Master pries;
Looks in and out, and through and through;
Says nothing--till at last he spies
A wound upon the Mastiff's head, 
A wound, where plainly might be read
What feats an Ass's hoof can do!
But drop the rest:--this aggravation,
This complicated provocation,
A hoard of grievances unsealed;
All past forgiveness it repealed;
And thus, and through distempered blood
On both sides, Benjamin the good,
The patient, and the tender-hearted,
Was from his team and waggon parted; 
When duty of that day was o'er,
Laid down his whip--and served no more,--
Nor could the waggon long survive,
Which Benjamin had ceased to drive:
It lingered on;--guide after guide
Ambitiously the office tried;
But each unmanageable hill
Called for 'his' patience and 'his' skill;--
And sure it is, that through this night,
And what the morning brought to light, 
Two losses had we to sustain,
We lost both WAGGONER and WAIN!



Accept, O Friend, for praise or blame,
The gift of this adventurous song;
A record which I dared to frame,
Though timid scruples checked me long;
They checked me--and I left the theme
Untouched--in spite of many a gleam
Of fancy which thereon was shed,
Like pleasant sunbeams shifting still 
Upon the side of a distant hill:
But Nature might not be gainsaid;
For what I have and what I miss
I sing of these;--it makes my bliss!
Nor is it I who play the part,
But a shy spirit in my heart,
That comes and goes--will sometimes leap
From hiding-places ten years deep;
Or haunts me with familiar face,
Returning, like a ghost unlaid, 
Until the debt I owe be paid.
Forgive me, then; for I had been
On friendly terms with this Machine:
In him, while he was wont to trace
Our roads, through many a long year's space,
A living almanack had we;
We had a speaking diary,
That in this uneventful place
Gave to the days a mark and name
By which we knew them when they came. 
--Yes, I, and all about me here,
Through all the changes of the year,
Had seen him through the mountains go,
In pomp of mist or pomp of snow,
Majestically huge and slow:
Or, with a milder grace adorning
The landscape of a summer's morning;
While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain
The moving image to detain;
And mighty Fairfield, with a chime 
Of echoes, to his march kept time;
When little other business stirred,
And little other sound was heard;
In that delicious hour of balm,
Stillness, solitude, and calm,
While yet the valley is arrayed,
On this side with a sober shade;
On that is prodigally bright--
Crag, lawn, and wood--with rosy light.
I wish to have thee here again,
When windows flap and chimney roars,
And all is dismal out of doors;
And, sitting by my fire, I see
Eight sorry carts, no less a train;
Unworthy successors of thee,
Come straggling through the wind and rain!
And oft, as they pass slowly on,
Beneath my windows, one by one,
See, perched upon the naked height 
The summit of a cumbrous freight,
A single traveller--and there
Another; then perhaps a pair--
The lame, the sickly, and the old;
Men, women, heartless with the cold;
And babes in wet and starveling plight
Which once, be weather as it might,
Had still a nest within a nest,
Thy shelter--and their mother's breast!
Then most of all, then far the most, 
Do I regret what we have lost;
Am grieved for that unhappy sin
Which robbed us of good Benjamin;
And of his stately Charge, which none
Could keep alive when He was gone

IF Wytheburn's modest House of prayer,
As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,
Had, with its belfry's humble stock, 
A little pair that hang in air,
Been mistress also of a clock,
(And one, too, not in crazy plight)
Twelve strokes that clock would have been telling
Under the brow of old Helvellyn--
Its bead-roll of midnight,
Then, when the Hero of my tale
Was passing by, and, down the vale
(The vale now silent, hushed I ween
As if a storm had never been) 
Proceeding with a mind at ease;
While the old Familiar of the seas,
Intent to use his utmost haste,
Gained ground upon the Waggon fast,
And gives another lusty cheer;
For spite of rumbling of the wheels,
A welcome greeting he can hear;--
It is a fiddle in its glee
Dinning from the CHERRY TREE!
Thence the sound--the light is there-- 
As Benjamin is now aware,
Who, to his inward thoughts confined,
Had almost reached the festive door,
When, startled by the Sailor's roar,
He hears a sound and sees a light,
And in a moment calls to mind
That 'tis the village MERRY-NIGHT!
Although before in no dejection,
At this insidious recollection
His heart with sudden joy is filled,-- 
His ears are by the music thrilled,
His eyes take pleasure in the road
Glittering before him bright and broad;
And Benjamin is wet and cold,
And there are reasons manifold
That make the good, tow'rds which he's yearning,
Look fairly like a lawful earning.
Nor has thought time to come and go,
To vibrate between yes and no;
For, cries the Sailor, 'Glorious chance 
That blew us hither!--let him dance,
Who can or will!--my honest soul,
Our treat shall be a friendly bowl!'
He draws him to the door--'Come in,
Come, come,' cries he to Benjamin!
And Benjamin--ah, woe is me!
Gave the word--the horses heard
And halted, though reluctantly.
'Blithe souls and lightsome hearts have we,
Feasting at the CHERRY TREE!' 
This was the outside proclamation,
This was the inside salutation;
What bustling--jostling--high and low!
A universal overflow!
What tankards foaming from the tap!
What store of cakes in every lap!
What thumping--stumping--overhead!
The thunder had not been more busy:
With such a stir you would have said,
This little place may well be dizzy! 
'Tis who can dance with greatest vigour--
'Tis what can be most prompt and eager;
As if it heard the fiddle's call,
The pewter clatters on the wall;
The very bacon shows its feeling,
Swinging from the smoky ceiling!
A steaming bowl, a blazing fire,
What greater good can heart desire?
'Twere worth a wise man's while to try
The utmost anger of the sky: 
To 'seek' for thoughts of a gloomy cast,
If such the bright amends at last.
Now should you say I judge amiss,
The CHERRY TREE shows proof of this;
For soon of all the happy there,
Our Travellers are the happiest pair;
All care with Benjamin is gone--
A Caesar past the Rubicon!
He thinks not of his long, long strife;--
The Sailor, Man by nature gay, 
Hath no resolves to throw away;
And he hath now forgot his Wife,
Hath quite forgotten her--or may be
Thinks her the luckiest soul on earth,
Within that warm and peaceful berth,
Under cover,
Terror over,
Sleeping by her sleeping Baby,
With bowl that sped from hand to hand,
The gladdest of the gladsome band, 
Amid their own delight and fun,
They hear--when every dance is done,
When every whirling bout is o'er--
The fiddle's 'squeak'--that call to bliss,
Ever followed by a kiss;
They envy not the happy lot,
But enjoy their own the more!
While thus our jocund Travellers fare,
Up springs the Sailor from his chair--
Limps (for I might have told before 
That he was lame) across the floor--
Is gone--returns--and with a prize;
With what?--a Ship of lusty size;
A gallant stately Man-of-war,
Fixed on a smoothly-sliding car.
Surprise to all, but most surprise
To Benjamin, who rubs his eyes,
Not knowing that he had befriended
A Man so gloriously attended!
'This,' cries the Sailor, 'a Third-rate is-- 
Stand back, and you shall see her gratis!
This was the Flag-ship at the Nile,
The Vanguard--you may smirk and smile,
But, pretty Maid, if you look near,
You'll find you've much in little here!
A nobler ship did never swim,
And you shall see her in full trim:
I'll set, my friends, to do you honour,
Set every inch of sail upon her.'
So said, so done; and masts, sails, yards, 
He names them all; and interlards
His speech with uncouth terms of art,
Accomplished in the showman's part;
And then, as from a sudden check,
Cries out--''Tis there, the quarter-deck
On which brave Admiral Nelson stood--
A sight that would have roused your blood!
One eye he had, which, bright as ten,
Burned like a fire among his men;
Let this be land, and that be sea, 
Here lay the French--and 'thus' came we!'
Hushed was by this the fiddle's sound,
The dancers all were gathered round,
And, such the stillness of the house,
You might have heard a nibbling mouse;
While, borrowing helps where'er he may,
The Sailor through the story runs
Of ships to ships and guns to guns;
And does his utmost to display
The dismal conflict, and the might 
And terror of that marvellous night!
'A bowl, a bowl of double measure,'
Cries Benjamin, 'a draught of length,
To Nelson, England's pride and treasure,
Her bulwark and her tower of strength!'
When Benjamin had seized the bowl,
The mastiff, from beneath the waggon,
Where he lay, watchful as a dragon,
Rattled his chain;--'twas all in vain,
For Benjamin, triumphant soul! 
He heard the monitory growl;
Heard--and in opposition quaffed
A deep, determined, desperate draught!
Nor did the battered Tar forget,
Or flinch from what he deemed his debt:
Then, like a hero crowned with laurel,
Back to her place the ship he led;
Wheeled her back in full apparel;
And so, flag flying at mast head,
Re-yoked her to the Ass:--anon, 
Cries Benjamin, 'We must be gone.
Thus, after two hours' hearty stay,
Again behold them on their way

RIGHT gladly had the horses stirred,
When they the wished-for greeting heard,
The whip's loud notice from the door,
That they were free to move once more.
You think, those doings must have bred
In them disheartening doubts and dread;
No, not a horse of all the eight, 
Although it be a moonless night,
Fears either for himself or freight;
For this they know (and let it hide,
In part, the offences of their guide)
That Benjamin, with clouded brains,
Is worth the best with all their pains;
And, if they had a prayer to make,
The prayer would be that they may take
With him whatever comes in course,
The better fortune or the worse; 
That no one else may have business near them,
And, drunk or sober, he may steer them.
So, forth in dauntless mood they fare,
And with them goes the guardian pair.
Now, heroes, for the true commotion,
The triumph of your late devotion
Can aught on earth impede delight,
Still mounting to a higher height;
And higher still--a greedy flight!
Can any low-born care pursue her, 
Can any mortal clog come to her?
No notion have they--not a thought,
That is from joyless regions brought!
And, while they coast the silent lake,
Their inspiration I partake;
Share their empyreal spirits--yea,
With their enraptured vision, see--
O fancy--what a jubilee!
What shifting pictures--clad in gleams
Of colour bright as feverish dreams! 
Earth, spangled sky, and lake serene,
Involved and restless all--a scene
Pregnant with mutual exaltation,
Rich change, and multiplied creation!
This sight to me the Muse imparts;--
And then, what kindness in their hearts!
What tears of rapture, what vow-making,
Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking!
What solemn, vacant, interlacing,
As if they'd fall asleep embracing! 
Then, in the turbulence of glee,
And in the excess of amity,
Says Benjamin, 'That Ass of thine,
He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine:
If he were tethered to the waggon,
He'd drag as well what he is dragging,
And we, as brother should with brother,
Might trudge it alongside each other!'
Forthwith, obedient to command,
The horses made a quiet stand; 
And to the waggon's skirts was tied
The Creature, by the Mastiff's side,
The Mastiff wondering, and perplext
With dread of what will happen next;
And thinking it but sorry cheer,
To have such company so near!
This new arrangement made, the Wain
Through the still night proceeds again;
No Moon hath risen her light to lend;
But indistinctly may be kenned 
The VANGUARD, following close behind,
Sails spread, as if to catch the wind!
'Thy wife and child are snug and warm,
Thy ship will travel without harm;
I like,' said Benjamin, 'her shape and stature:
And this of mine--this bulky creature
Of which I have the steering--this,
Seen fairly, is not much amiss!
We want your streamers, friend, you know;
But, altogether as we go, 
We make a kind of handsome show!
Among these hills, from first to last,
We've weathered many a furious blast;
Hard passage forcing on, with head
Against the storm, and canvas spread.
I hate a boaster; but to thee
Will say't, who know'st both land and sea,
The unluckiest hulk that stems the brine
Is hardly worse beset than mine,
When cross-winds on her quarter beat; 
And, fairly lifted from my feet,
I stagger onward--heaven knows how;
But not so pleasantly as now:
Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,
And many a foundrous pit surrounded!
Yet here we are, by night and day
Grinding through rough and smooth our way;
Through foul and fair our task fulfilling;
'Ay,' said the Tar, 'through fair and foul-- 
But save us from yon screeching owl!'
That instant was begun a fray
Which called their thoughts another way:
The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl!
What must he do but growl and snarl,
Still more and more dissatisfied
With the meek comrade at his side!
Till, not incensed though put to proof,
The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof,
Salutes the Mastiff on the head; 
And so were better manners bred,
And all was calmed and quieted.
'Yon screech-owl,' says the Sailor, turning
Back to his former cause of mourning,
'Tis worse than any funeral bell;
As sure as I've the gift of sight,
We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!'
--Said Benjamin, 'This whip shall lay
A thousand, if they cross our way. 
I know that Wanton's noisy station,
I know him and his occupation;
The jolly bird hath learned his cheer
Upon the banks of Windermere;
Where a tribe of them make merry,
Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;
Hallooing from an open throat,
Like travellers shouting for a boat.
--The tricks he learned at Windermere
This vagrant owl is playing here-- 
That is the worst of his employment:
He's at the top of his enjoyment!'
This explanation stilled the alarm,
Cured the foreboder like a charm;
This, and the manner, and the voice,
Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;
His heart is up--he fears no evil
From life or death, from man or devil;
He wheels--and, making many stops,
Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops; 
And, while he talked of blows and scars,
Benjamin, among the stars,
Beheld a dancing--and a glancing;
Such retreating and advancing
As, I ween, was never seen
In bloodiest battle since the days of Mars



It is life in slow motion,
it's the heart in reverse,
it's a hope-and-a-half:
too much and too little at once.

It's a train that suddenly
stops with no station around,
and we can hear the cricket,
and, leaning out the carriage

door, we vainly contemplate
a wind we feel that stirs
the blooming meadows, the meadows
made imaginary by this stop.




Today the moon preens like a peacock, low overhead, 
My wild fearless eyes lower shy at his boldness, 
Like a newly opened bud at the first breach of light, 
Today his audacity is perverse he stalks me like a cloud, 
Over a lone hill, intruding in my path, brings your summons.

Flustered I sit wringing my hands expectant, what now, 
A heart that never broke its rhythm   has learnt to stop now, 
At your sight, cart wheels and somersaults, unaware like you, 
Moonlight was never missed now it is looked at in awe.
Today his temerity is regretted, I wish he would go elsewhere
Don’t burn my Songs in your fierce breath, I can wait a little
 Till he  arrives, my bethron heart still  dances in its cadence, 
 The stars joined the procession of hot coals, light their sparks
Speech of my heart is carried on in murmurings of a song, 
They tell me you are on your way soon enough as they whine
When you shall arrive to fuse your heartstrings with mine. 


If I really am walking with ordinary habit 
past the same rest home on the same local street 
and see another waiting head at that upper front window, 
just as she would always sit, 
watching for anyone from her wooden seat, 
then anything can be true. I only know 
how each night she wrote in her leather books 
that no one came. Surely I remember the hooks 
of her fingers curled on mine, though even now 
will not admit the times I did avoid this street, 
where she lived on and on like a bleached fig 
and forgot us anyhow; 
visiting the pulp of her kiss, bending to repeat 
each favor, trying to comb out her mossy wig 
and forcing love to last. Now she is always dead 
and the leather books are mine. Today I see the head 
move, like some pitted angel, in that high window. 
What is the waiting head doing? It looks the same. 
Will it lean forward as I turn to go? 
I think I hear it call to me below 


but no one came no one came
. 

The windscreen wipers worked at such a pace, 
Large raindrops, heavy, thrown down by the storm, 
No distance could you see, all was  a blur, 
No shape of tree or house, there was no form.

The rage that was emptying all around, 
Gave vent to such an angry crashing threat.
A terrifying rumpus did one hear, 
But violence had not quite arrived as yet.

Sheer power then ripped the waiting land apart, 
Battering all of natures growing things.
Striking like a cobra in the wet grass, 
Caring not what all such fierce anger brings.

Best sit tight and then wait for it to ease, 
Once the main body of the force is spent.
Jet wash for the car, it now shines anew, 
And raindrops again, but with softness sent. 



Hail to thee, mountain beloved, with thy glittering purple-dyed summit!
   Hail to thee also, fair sun, looking so lovingly on!
 Thee, too, I hail, thou smiling plain, and ye murmuring lindens,
   Ay, and the chorus so glad, cradled on yonder high boughs;
 Thee, too, peaceably azure, in infinite measure extending
   Round the dusky-hued mount, over the forest so green,--
 Round about me, who now from my chamber's confinement escaping,
   And from vain frivolous talk, gladly seek refuge with thee.
 Through me to quicken me runs the balsamic stream of thy breezes,
   While the energetical light freshens the gaze as it thirsts.
 Bright o'er the blooming meadow the changeable colors are gleaming,
   But the strife, full of charms, in its own grace melts away
 Freely the plain receives me,--with carpet far away reaching,
   Over its friendly green wanders the pathway along.
 Round me is humming the busy bee, and with pinion uncertain
   Hovers the butterfly gay over the trefoil's red flower.
 Fiercely the darts of the sun fall on me,--the zephyr is silent,
   Only the song of the lark echoes athwart the clear air.
 Now from the neighboring copse comes a roar, and the tops of the alders
   Bend low down,--in the wind dances the silvery grass;
 Night ambrosial circles me round; in the coolness so fragrant
   Greets me a beauteous roof, formed by the beeches' sweet shade.
 In the depths of the wood the landscape suddenly leaves me
   And a serpentine path guides up my footsteps on high.
 Only by stealth can the light through the leafy trellis of branches
   Sparingly pierce, and the blue smilingly peeps through the boughs,
 But in a moment the veil is rent, and the opening forest
   Suddenly gives back the day's glittering brightness to me!
 Boundlessly seems the distance before my gaze to be stretching,
   And in a purple-tinged hill terminates sweetly the world.

 Deep at the foot of the mountain, that under me falls away steeply,
   Wanders the greenish-hued stream, looking like glass as it flows.
 Endlessly under me see I the ether, and endlessly o'er
   Giddily look I above, shudderingly look I below,
 But between the infinite height and the infinite hollow
   Safely the wanderer moves over a well-guarded path.
 Smilingly past me are flying the banks all teeming with riches,
   And the valley so bright boasts of its industry glad.
 See how yonder hedgerows that sever the farmer's possessions
   Have by Demeter been worked into the tapestried plain!
 Kindly decree of the law, of the Deity mortal-sustaining,
   Since from the brazen world love vanished forever away.
 But in freer windings the measured pastures are traversed
   (Now swallowed up in the wood, now climbing up to the hills)
 By a glimmering streak, the highway that knits lands together;
   Over the smooth-flowing stream, quietly glide on the rafts.

 Ofttimes resound the bells of the flocks in the fields that seem living,
   And the shepherd's lone song wakens the echo again.
 Joyous villages crown the stream, in the copse others vanish,
   While from the back of the mount, others plunge wildly below.
 Man still lives with the land in neighborly friendship united,
   And round his sheltering roof calmly repose still his fields;
 Trustingly climbs the vine high over the low-reaching window,
   While round the cottage the tree circles its far-stretching boughs.
 Happy race of the plain! Not yet awakened to freedom,
   Thou and thy pastures with joy share in the limited law;
 Bounded thy wishes all are by the harvest's peaceable circuit,
   And thy lifetime is spent e'en as the task of the day!

 But what suddenly hides the beauteous view? A strange spirit
   Over the still-stranger plain spreads itself quickly afar--
 Coyly separates now, what scarce had lovingly mingled,
   And 'tis the like that alone joins itself on to the like.
 Orders I see depicted; the haughty tribes of the poplars
   Marshalled in regular pomp, stately and beauteous appear.
 All gives token of rule and choice, and all has its meaning,--
   'Tis this uniform plan points out the Ruler to me.
 Brightly the glittering domes in far-away distance proclaim him.
   Out of the kernel of rocks rises the city's high wall.
 Into the desert without, the fauns of the forest are driven,
   But by devotion is lent life more sublime to the stone.
 Man is brought into nearer union with man, and around him
   Closer, more actively wakes, swifter moves in him the world.
 See! the emulous forces in fiery conflict are kindled,
   Much, they effect when they strive, more they effect when they join.
 Thousands of hands by one spirit are moved, yet in thousands of bosoms
   Beats one heart all alone, by but one feeling inspired--
 Beats for their native land, and glows for their ancestors' precepts;
   Here on the well-beloved spot, rest now time-honored bones.

 Down from the heavens descends the blessed troop of immortals,
   In the bright circle divine making their festal abode;
 Granting glorious gifts, they appear: and first of all, Ceres
   Offers the gift of the plough, Hermes the anchor brings next,
 Bacchus the grape, and Minerva the verdant olive-tree's branches,
   Even his charger of war brings there Poseidon as well.
 Mother Cybele yokes to the pole of her chariot the lions,
   And through the wide-open door comes as a citizen in.
 Sacred stones! 'Tis from ye that proceed humanity's founders,
   Morals and arts ye sent forth, e'en to the ocean's far isles.
 'Twas at these friendly gates that the law was spoken by sages;
   In their Penates' defence, heroes rushed out to the fray.
 On the high walls appeared the mothers, embracing their infants,
   Looking after the march, till the distance 'twas lost.
 Then in prayer they threw themselves down at the deities' altars,
   Praying for triumph and fame, praying for your safe return.
 Honor and triumph were yours, but naught returned save your glory,
   And by a heart-touching stone, told are your valorous deeds.
 "Traveller! when thou com'st to Sparta, proclaim to the people
   That thou hast seen us lie here, as by the law we were bid

"
 Slumber calmly, ye loved ones! for sprinkled o'er by your life-blood,
   Flourish the olive-trees there, joyously sprouts the good seed.
 In its possessions exulting, industry gladly is kindled.
   And from the sedge of the stream smilingly signs the blue god.
 Crushingly falls the axe on the tree, the Dryad sighs sadly;
   Down from the crest of the mount plunges the thundering load.
 Winged by the lever, the stone from the rocky crevice is loosened;
   Into the mountain's abyss boldly the miner descends.
 Mulciber's anvil resounds with the measured stroke of the hammer;
   Under the fist's nervous blow, spurt out the sparks of the steel.
 Brilliantly twines the golden flax round the swift-whirling spindles,
   Through the strings of the yarn whizzes the shuttle away.

 Far in the roads the pilot calls, and the vessels are waiting,
   That to the foreigner's land carry the produce of home;
 Others gladly approach with the treasures of far-distant regions,
   High on the mast's lofty head flutters the garland of mirth.
 See how yon markets, those centres of life and of gladness, are swarming!
   Strange confusion of tongues sounds in the wondering ear.
 On to the pile the wealth of the earth is heaped by the merchant,
   All that the sun's scorching rays bring forth on Africa's soil,
 All that Arabia prepares, that the uttermost Thule produces,
   High with heart-gladdening stores fills Amalthea her horn.
 Fortune wedded to talent gives birth there to children immortal,
   Suckled in liberty's arms, flourish the arts there of joy.
 With the image of life the eyes by the sculptor are ravished,
   And by the chisel inspired, speaks e'en the sensitive stone.
 Skies artificial repose on slender Ionian columns,
   And a Pantheon includes all that Olympus contains.
 Light as the rainbow's spring through the air, as the dart from the bowstring,
   Leaps the yoke of the bridge over the boisterous stream.

 But in his silent chamber the thoughtful sage is projecting
   Magical circles, and steals e'en on the spirit that forms,
 Proves the force of matter, the hatreds and loves of the magnet,
   Follows the tune through the air, follows through ether the ray,
 Seeks the familiar law in chance's miracles dreaded,
   Looks for the ne'er-changing pole in the phenomena's flight.
 Bodies and voices are lent by writing to thought ever silent,
   Over the centuries' stream bears it the eloquent page.
 Then to the wondering gaze dissolves the cloud of the fancy,
   And the vain phantoms of night yield to the dawning of day.
 Man now breaks through his fetters, the happy one!  Oh, let him never
   Break from the bridle of shame, when from fear's fetters he breaks
 Freedom! is reason's cry,--ay, freedom!  The wild raging passions
   Eagerly cast off the bonds Nature divine had imposed.

 Ah! in the tempest the anchors break loose, that warningly held him
   On to the shore, and the stream tears him along in its flood,--
 Into infinity whirls him,--the coasts soon vanish before him,
   High on the mountainous waves rocks all-dismasted the bark;
 Under the clouds are hid the steadfast stars of the chariot,
   Naught now remains,--in the breast even the god goes astray.
 Truth disappears from language, from life all faith and all honor
   Vanish, and even the oath is but a lie on the lips.
 Into the heart's most trusty bond, and into love's secrets,
   Presses the sycophant base, tearing the friend from the friend.
 Treason on innocence leers, with looks that seek to devour,
   And the fell slanderer's tooth kills with its poisonous bite.
 In the dishonored bosom, thought is now venal, and love, too,
   Scatters abroad to the winds, feelings once god-like and free.
 All thy holy symbols, O truth, deceit has adopted,
   And has e'en dared to pollute Nature's own voices so fair,
 That the craving heart in the tumult of gladness discovers;
   True sensations are now mute and can scarcely be heard.
 Justice boasts at the tribune, and harmony vaunts in the cottage,
   While the ghost of the law stands at the throne of the king.
 Years together, ay, centuries long, may the mummy continue,
   And the deception endure, apeing the fulness of life.
 Until Nature awakes, and with hands all-brazen and heavy
   'Gainst the hollow-formed pile time and necessity strikes.
 Like a tigress, who, bursting the massive grating iron,
   Of her Numidian wood suddenly, fearfully thinks,--
 So with the fury of crime and anguish, humanity rises
   Hoping nature, long-lost in the town's ashes, to find.
 Oh then open, ye walls, and set the captive at freedom
   To the long desolate plains let him in safety return!

 But where am I? The path is now hid, declivities rugged
   Bar, with their wide-yawning gulfs, progress before and behind.
 Now far behind me is left the gardens' and hedges' sure escort,
   Every trace of man's hand also remains far behind.
 Only the matter I see piled up, whence life has its issue,
   And the raw mass of basalt waits for a fashioning hand.
 Down through its channel of rock the torrent roaringly rushes,
   Angrily forcing a path under the roots of the trees.
 All is here wild and fearfully desolate.  Naught but the eagle
   Hangs in the lone realms of air, knitting the world to the clouds.
 Not one zephyr on soaring pinion conveys to my hearing
   Echoes, however remote, marking man's pleasures and pains.
 Am I in truth, then, alone? Within thine arms, on thy bosom,
   Nature, I lie once again!--Ah, and 'twas only a dream
 That assailed me with horrors so fearful; with life's dreaded phantom,
   And with the down-rushing vale, vanished the gloomy one too.
 Purer my life I receive again from thine altar unsullied,--
   Purer receive the bright glow felt by my youth's hopeful days.
 Ever the will is changing its aim and its rule, while forever,
   In a still varying form, actions revolve round themselves.
 But in enduring youth, in beauty ever renewing.
   Kindly Nature, with grace thou dost revere the old law!
 Ever the same, for the man in thy faithful hands thou preservest
   That which the child in its sport, that which the youth lent to thee;
 At the same breast thou dost suckle the ceaselessly-varying ages;
   Under the same azure vault, over the same verdant earth,
 Races, near and remote, in harmony wander together,
   See, even Homer's own sun looks on us, too, with a smile



With the cold moments of the past fleeting by,
Your wild eyes contained in your silent demeanor
build a wall around me
And I flee from you to a pathless path.

Until I see valleys on the moons dirt
Until I wash my body in the water fountains of light
In a colorful fog of a warm summer morning
I’ll fill my skirt with lilies from the fields
And hear the roar of roosters from the village rooftops

I’m fleeing from you to the very skirts of the valley
Where I’ll press my feet to the ground
Until they sip dewdrops of grass
I’m fleeing from you to a deserted beach
Where on the lost boulders beneath dark clouds
I’ll learn the twisting dance of the ocean’s hurricane

In a far off sunset, like wild doves
I’ll see fields, mountains, and the sky beneath my feet.
And in the midst of dry bushes I’ll hear
the blissful music of field birds.
 

I’m fleeing from you until I open the path
To the city of desires
And in that city-
The castle of dreams will have a heavy golden lock

But your eyes with their silent scream
Will blur my vision
Like your dark secrets that
Build a wall around me.

At last one day-
I’ll flee from the illusion of conceiving doubt
And I’ll radiate like a perfume from
the colorful flower of dreams
And I’ll diffuse into the wavy hair of night’s zephyr
And travel to the very beaches of the Sun
In a silent world, within an eternity of calmness.


I’ll gently rock on a bed of golden-colored clouds
That extends hand like rays toward the serene sky
As if playing a song.

It is there where I am happy and free
And I weave memories of this world 
Because your bewitching eyes 
Find my eyes
And blur my vision
Like your dark secrets
That build a wall around me.


It's painted anew
Erasing all old stories
With a dab of fresh color
Though the past is there
I can hardly read
Words are still there
Behind the new-found flash
That paints away the phantoms
From the book of yesterday

No writing, come and see
The wall is blank and free
Bring your pen and write
Something unwritten before
A line of soulful depth
Hiding a world beneath
Something that would stay
Withstanding the rough day
And the stroke of a brush

I hold the pen
Between my fingers
The wall is inviting
New words arise in me
Waiting to burst out
And splash the clean wall
Once again, as in past
Let's go on and on
Writing away


Those greedy bastards, 
worship money and power, 
in name of Ayn Rand. 


my head foaming clouds, sea inside me and out 
I am a walnut tree in Gulhane Park 
an old walnut, knot by knot, shred by shred 
Neither you are aware of this, nor the police 

I am a walnut tree in Gulhane Park 
My leaves are nimble, nimble like fish in water 
My leaves are sheer, sheer like a silk handkerchief 
pick, wipe, my rose, the tear from your eyes 
My leaves are my hands, I have one hundred thousand 
I touch you with one hundred thousand hands, I touch Istanbul 
My leaves are my eyes, I look in amazement 
I watch you with one hundred thousand eyes, I watch Istanbul 
Like one hundred thousand hearts, beat, beat my leaves 

I am a walnut tree in Gulhane Park 
neither you are aware of this, nor the police


The wan sun westers, faint and slow;
The eastern distance glimmers gray;
An eerie haze comes creeping low
Across the little, lonely bay;
And from the sky-line far away
About the quiet heaven are spread
Mysterious hints of dying day,
Thin, delicate dreams of green and red.

And weak, reluctant surges lap
And rustle round and down the strand.
No other sound . . . If it should hap,
The ship that sails from fairy-land!
The silken shrouds with spells are manned,
The hull is magically scrolled,
The squat mast lives, and in the sand
The gold prow-griffin claws a hold.

It steals to seaward silently;
Strange fish-folk follow thro' the gloom;
Great wings flap overhead; I see
The Castle of the Drowsy Doom
Vague thro' the changeless twilight loom,
Enchanted, hushed. And ever there
She slumbers in eternal bloom,
Her cushions hid with golden hair. 



To see the clouds his spirit yearned toward so 
Over new mountains piled and unploughed waves, 
Back of old-storied spires and architraves 
To watch Arcturus rise or Fomalhaut,

And roused by street-cries in strange tongues when day 
Flooded with gold some domed metropolis, 
Between new towers to waken and new bliss 
Spread on his pillow in a wondrous way:

These were his joys. Oft under bulging crates, 
Coming to market with his morning load, 
The peasant found him early on his road 
To greet the sunrise at the city-gates,---

There where the meadows waken in its rays, 
Golden with mist, and the great roads commence, 
And backward, where the chimney-tops are dense, 
Cathedral-arches glimmer through the haze.

White dunes that breaking show a strip of sea, 
A plowman and his team against the blue 
Swiss pastures musical with cowbells, too, 
And poplar-lined canals in Picardie,

And coast-towns where the vultures back and forth
Sail in the clear depths of the tropic sky,
And swallows in the sunset where they fly
Over gray Gothic cities in the north,

And the wine-cellar and the chorus there,
The dance-hall and a face among the crowd,---
Were all delights that made him sing aloud 
For joy to sojourn in a world so fair.

Back of his footsteps as he journeyed fell 
Range after range; ahead blue hills emerged. 
Before him tireless to applaud it surged 
The sweet interminable spectacle.

And like the west behind a sundown sea 
Shone the past joys his memory retraced, 
And bright as the blue east he always faced 
Beckoned the loves and joys that were to be.

From every branch a blossom for his brow 
He gathered, singing down Life's flower-lined road, 
And youth impelled his spirit as he strode 
Like winged Victory on the galley's prow.

That Loveliness whose being sun and star,
Green Earth and dawn and amber evening robe,
That lamp whereof the opalescent globe
The season's emulative splendors are,

That veiled divinity whose beams transpire 
From every pore of universal space,
As the fair soul illumes the lovely face---
That was his guest, his passion, his desire.

His heart the love of Beauty held as hides 
One gem most pure a casket of pure gold. 
It was too rich a lesser thing to bold;
It was not large enough for aught besides. 



How few, of all the hearts that loved,
  Are grieving for thee now; 
And why should mine to-night be moved
  With such a sense of woe? 

Too often thus, when left alone,
  Where none my thoughts can see,
Comes back a word, a passing tone
  From thy strange history.

Sometimes I seem to see thee rise,
  A glorious child again; 
All virtues beaming from thine eyes
  That ever honoured men:

Courage and truth, a generous breast
  Where sinless sunshine lay:
A being whose very presence blest
  Like gladsome summer-day.

O, fairly spread thy early sail,
  And fresh, and pure, and free,
Was the first impulse of the gale
  Which urged life's wave for thee! 

Why did the pilot, too confiding,
  Dream o'er that ocean's foam,
And trust in Pleasure's careless guiding
  To bring his vessel home? 

For well he knew what dangers frowned,
  What mists would gather, dim; 
What rocks and shelves, and sands lay round
  Between his port and him.

The very brightness of the sun
  The splendour of the main,
The wind which bore him wildly on
  Should not have warned in vain.

An anxious gazer from the shore—
  I marked the whitening wave,
And wept above thy fate the more
  Because—I could not save.

It recks not now, when all is over:
  But yet my heart will be
A mourner still, though friend and lover
  Have both forgotten thee



A LONE, wayfaring wretch I saw, who stood 
Wearily pausing by the wicket gate; 
And from his eyes there streamed a bitter flood, 
Contrasting his with many a happier fate. 
Bleak howled the wind, the sleety shower fell fast 
On his bare head, and scanty-covered breast; 
As through the village with quick step I past, 
To find sweet shelter in my home of rest. 

'Oh! that I too could call a home my own!' 
Said the lone wanderer, as he wistful gazed 
Through the clear lattice, on the hearth's wide stone, 
Where cheerily the jocund fire blazed. 
'Oh! that I too, in such a cot might dwell! 
Where the bright homefire blazeth clear and high: 
Where joy alone my grateful heart might swell, 
And children's children bless me when I die!' 

Little he deemed what bitterness was there, 
Who murmured thus his aspirations vain,-- 
Little he deemed that one as fond as fair 
Lay faintly sighing on a bed of pain: 
And by her side, a restless vigil keeping, 
One who had deeply wronged that gentle heart-- 
Knelt with clasped hands; now praying, and now weeping; 
Dreading, each hour, to see the soul depart. 

They were two sisters jealous love had twained; 
And one had slandered he who faded lay, 
Because she deemed her slighted love disdained: 
And he they both had loved was far away: 
And from that hour, the younger drooped and pined, 
Like a pale snowdrop bowing down her head; 
Joyless of life--to slow disease resigned-- 
The heart within her was already dead. 

Here, for her sake, they woo the mountain gale, 
If, haply, change may yet prevent her fate. 
But he, the wanderer, knew not of this tale, 
And humbly sues admittance at their gate. 
He enters--what hath met his eager eyes? 
Pale as the white-fringed drapery spread beneath, 
His early loved, his sorely slandered, lies, 
Heaving with pain her faint and quickened breath. 

O'er her soft arm her long, dark, glossy hair, 
Floats in unbraided beauty,--and her cheek,-- 
Ah, me! the deeply-crimsoned tinge is there, 
That of sharp woe and early death doth speak. 
How beautiful, beneath her drooping eye, 
The glowing hectic of that cheek appears, 
Where the long lashes like soft shadows lie, 
Seeking in vain to prison back her tears. 

She gazes--shrieks--'tis he! at length 'tis he, 
Whom dreams and waking thoughts have brought in vain! 
And must she die, e'er yet from sorrow free, 
Her head hath rested on his heart again? 
A few slow, bitter words of wild appeal-- 
Of earnest explanation faintly given-- 
A pressure, which his hand can scarcely feel, 
And her freed soul is on its way to heaven! 

So, wanderers in the world may pausing gaze 
Upon some radiant form with smiles of light, 
And seeing but the outward beam that plays, 
Envy their joys--and deem that all is bright. 
The homes of other hearts! oh! yet beware, 
Ye, who with friendly guise would enter in, 
Lest all be false,--and ye be doomed to share 
Their guilt or woe--their sadness or their sin

The corpses lay like watermelons
Ready for harvest
In a reversal of mutiny roles
Where the commander shot the rank and file
For a religio-political war
And they called it Book Haram. 


I.
Yonder, with eyes that tears, not distance, dim,
With ears the wide world's thickness cannot daunt,
We see tumultuous miseries that haunt
The night's dead watches, hear the battle hymn
Of ruin shrieking through the music grim,
Where the red spectre straddles, long and gaunt,
Spitting across the seas his hideous taunt
At those who nurse at home the unwounded limb.

What shall we say, who, drawing indolent breath,
Mark the quick pant of those who, full of hate,
Drive home the steel or loose the shrieking shell,
Heroes or Huns, who smite the grin of death
And laugh or curse beneath the blows of fate,
Swept madly to the thudding heart of hell?

II.
O peace, be still! Let no drear whirlwind sweep
Our souls about the vault, that groans or yells
In travail of the brood of Fear, and swells
Stupendous with new monsters of the deep.
This is no day to wring the hands and weep,
No hour for hopeless tolling and clash of bells.
Faith is no faith if god or demon quells
One hope or drugs it to uneasy sleep.

What you have shed man's blood for, fight for still
In world-wide conflict, joining hand with hand;
Hate fear and hatred and the seed thereof,
And, since you have struck for Freedom, do her will
And smash the barriers parting land from land,
Unfaltering armies of immortal love. 


Something inside me
wants to scream and shout
I LOVE YOU

But memories of past
rejection still haunt me
because they tell me
that I'll end up
with a broken heart
but that doesn't change the fact
that; I STILL LOVE YOU! 

There is a war going on
inside me
that has not yet finished
and If you only knew
the number of sleepless nights
I have hadthinking about you
you would realize that
I LOVE YOU

well, I realized that
the coward in all this is me
because you would never know
how i feel about you
because i have kept
my love for you silent
but, what I really want 
you to know is


The war is over and the war has started
Democracy they say is for the people
But here the people hear it 
As it passes through
Its wind cold or hot they do not know
They say ballot boxes have caused a landslide
And the winner's hands up
With the symbol of victory.

Do free and fair elections 
Bring food on the table? 
Does the ousted of a slow and indolent regime
Necessarily bring dividends
From a calculated nepotistic reign
In its slow infant steps? 

The war is over and the war has started
The citizens who laid a path for democracy
Are not allowed to tread the path
Majority have foisted their numbers
On the minority
And this is the meaning of democracy
Where elections are won
By hook or crook.
We will be here unend
Waiting for democracy to come indeed
But if we don't look for him
And bring him to work for us
We will only hear his name being called
And we feel he is our own.

The war was over
Fresh smell of bombs and canons
Reeked the whole land
Half walls stood riddled with bullets
Charred bodies of humans and animals
And houses lay smothering 
In the wind of the ruins war had spawned.

Survivors, men and women wounded
And Children starved waited to hear
The sound of of the red cross chopper
Coming to deliver hand outs.
Their chests rippled
From the thumping of their hearts
On their shoulders 
Clavicles protruded 
Carving hollows on both sides of the shoulders.

There was no food, no water
Except rain which then was unfit to drink
The women and Children sat 
Near mats, blankets,  empty plastic water  holders
And a few cats, hens and  ducks tjay survived the war
The men frailly mending the thatch
Of their  torn roofs
Yawning hungrily into the sky
The horror of war 
Had gone but the hurdle of survival
Was next starring in their faces
The land devoid of anything to hold 
Like debris in a river
For a drowning man."The war to end all wars" they said
And were naively believed
By those who now are honorably dead
Never knowing they were deceived

Wars are peddled with promised glory
With patriotic fervor, wars are sold
To those who die in warring gory
Without their right of growing old

For future generations, I’ve great concern
They needn’t set their world ablaze
For their survival they must discern
The peaceful road to better days


The Ward (hour)  

The mad genius finds himself in time
A world full of both rhythm and rhyme.
Tic Tock of the clock makes one go mad 
The manic mind is happy not sad.

Dancing with Doctor Gray all day long
My life so far has become some song.
Why does the caged bird sing? Ponder that.
To think, rain comes down, pitter pat.

The sun shines, the birds sing, a new day.
Finding a new way, makes life okay, 
Allows me to stay sane, and find myself
I'm just another book on the shelf.

Good conversations help time go by, 
Tell the truth always, no need to lie.
We feel, we connect, both bold and true
I see you in me and me in you.

Mindful practice day in and day out, 
Do away with all worries and doubt.
Always find yourself here in the now
Know yourself truly, this shows you how.

Someday soon you will be going home, 
And you'll feel enlightened in your dome.
You will now see your reality, 
And that you always have held the key.

So unlock the door, see what's in store
You will feel this deeply in your core.
Remember this is life, don't get bored, 
You too may find yourself in a ward. 


It's a little cold outside,                                          I am a little bit hungry,                                            I need your pretty words to                                           Keep me warm,                                                        I want some warm soup to forget                                       My hungry stomach,                                                   I need the whole world to look                                        At the hungry people who are                                          Starving to death without an answer,                                 I need a warm touch on my forehead and                                I need a pretty morsel to feed my stomach,                           Hungry people cry for food, but no one                                Listens to them and to their poor kids, so                            Only death is waiting these starving people.

War has caused me much pain
By peace only will I abide
Thoughts of battle make me insane
My sword lays forgotten by my side
There stands my faithful steed! 
who stood by me to the end
for war, of him, I have no need
He is naught now but my friend
A bag of gold within my hand
What was to be riches untold
plunder from that desolate land
the blood upon it's fields now cold
Much was done to earn this prize
yet at it, I cannot bare to look
I can still hear the bloody cries
of the men whos lives I took
I killed all who stood in my way
I spared not a single one! 
After the end of that bloody fray
I felt great sorrow for what I had done
I dump my gold into the river
'I shall have no money for blood! '
The cold spray makes me shiver
as the gold sinks into the mud
I did not fight to protect
for my family had already been killed
out of this came a horrible effect
a desire for revenge that could not be filled
War has caused me so much pain! 
War has given me nothing but sadness! 
Nothing of war did I gain
except empty and cursed madness
This madness is a balm for my aching heart
for with it, I feel nothing
of this world I do not wish to be a part
for there is naught in it but suffering
I grasp my sword one last time
I touch its cold steel blade
I should end my life because of my crime
A peaceful death in this shady glade
To my heart the sword is brought
as I bring myself to my knees
Suddenly I have another thought 
I throw the sword among the trees
'My consious I must free! 
I cannot atone of my sin if I am dead
How selfish only to think of me! '
These have been the wisest words I've ever said


The wasp and all his numerous family 
I look upon as a major calamity. 
He throws open his nest with prodigality, 
But I distrust his waspitality. 


Eliot like the English pundit
Chanting the shantih mantras
And sprinkling water with a mango leaf
From his water pot over the heads
With Om shantih shantih shantih.

Datta, dayadhvam, damayata (Give, sympathise, control)   
Shantih shantih shantih.
Is shantih for the dead souls like the penance
Of the Sagar sons by King Bhagirath? 
Is Eliot praying for a vegetation 
And the resurrection of a world order

Ugly aggressions can turn good lands                                 Into ugly wastelands simply because there are                        Sick minds that believe only in waging aggressions                   Against pretty people in their lands anytime and anywhere,          Missiles of mass destruction are targeting innocent people,         Pretty mosques and churches, hospitals, pretty towers, flowers and Roses, poor animals, .  . , . .. 


'Twixt hostile earth and sky;
The mottled lizard 'neath the stone
Is wiser here than I.

What stir across the haze of heat?
What omen down the wind?
The buck that break before my feet--
They know, but I am blind

Deep in the wood's recesses cool
I see the fairy dancers glide,
In cloth of gold, in gown of green,
My lord and lady side by side.

But who has hung from leaf to leaf,
From flower to flower, a silken twine—
A cloud of grey that holds the dew
In globes of clear enchanted wine ?

Or stretches far from branch to branch,
From thorn to thorn, in diamond rain ?
Who caught the cup of crystal pure
And hung so fair the shining chain ?

'Tis death, the spider, in his net,
Who lures the dancers as they glide,
In cloth of gold, in gown of green,
My lord and lady side by side.


     With what deep murmurs through time's silent stealth
     Doth thy transparent, cool, and wat'ry wealth
         Here flowing fall,
         And chide, and call,
     As if his liquid, loose retinue stay'd
     Ling'ring, and were of this steep place afraid;
         The common pass
         Where, clear as glass,
         All must descend
       Not to an end,
   But quicken'd by this deep and rocky grave,
   Rise to a longer course more bright and brave.

       Dear stream! dear bank, where often I
       Have sate and pleas'd my pensive eye,
       Why, since each drop of thy quick store
       Runs thither whence it flow'd before,
       Should poor souls fear a shade or night,
       Who came, sure, from a sea of light?
       Or since those drops are all sent back
       So sure to thee, that none doth lack,
       Why should frail flesh doubt any more

       O useful element and clear!
       My sacred wash and cleanser here,
       My first consigner unto those
       Fountains of life where the Lamb goes!
       What sublime truths and wholesome themes
       Lodge in thy mystical deep streams!
       Such as dull man can never find
       Unless that Spirit lead his mind
       Which first upon thy face did move,
       And hatch'd all with his quick'ning love.
       As this loud brook's incessant fall
       In streaming rings restagnates all,
       Which reach by course the bank, and then
       Are no more seen, just so pass men.
       O my invisible estate,
       My glorious liberty, still late!
       Thou art the channel my soul seeks,
       Not this with cataracts and creeks. 

The rowers four followed the cox
as never before.

This test of strength when called
came to the fore.

Their rivals in front, the line
appeared.

A wafer-thin margin of water then
ahead.

With a burst of muscles fired, they
ladled eight spears in fear.




There, all alone
A strong wave came with words
His thoughts weaving them
One task consumated
Another hanging waiting

 
Grabbing,
dragging, then fleeing away,
you swiftly spread- like a deadly plague,
on the run for the Other Soil, your destination's vague!
 
Watching you-
from far and wide,
in my seized  eye,
you’re a rebellious tide-
in an eternal glide.
 
Insistent, impatient, then a restless errant,
you must be calm in heart, fretful just in act!
And I now know, the sea of regret-  is your native land.
 
Yes, you are an unruly tide!
So always on the ride,
in an eternal glide!
 
But one night,
I will wear a mask-
made of the thirst-
of the remotest shores,
and their desert islands.  
And I’ll capture you- in my absorbing sands,
forever far away- from your naval natal lands.
 
 
Tas your dreams weave 
the flight of night birds 
landing nearby to gather 
midnight treats left by the quiet roar 
the rain of your dreams 
has washed away 
many of my tears


At first a mere thread of a footpath half blotted out by the grasses 
Sweeping triumphant across it, it wound between hedges of roses 
Whose blossoms were poised above leaves as pond lilies float on the water, 
While hidden by bloom in a hawthorn a bird filled the morning with singing. 

It widened a highway, majestic, stretching ever to distant horizons, 
Where shadows of tree-branches wavered, vague outlines invaded by sunshine; 
No sound but the wind as it whispered the secrets of earth to the flowers, 
And the hum of the yellow bees, honey-laden and dusty with pollen. 
And Summer said, "Come, follow onward, with no thought save the longing to wander, 
The wind, and the bees, and the flowers, all singing the great song of Nature, 
Are minstrels of change and of promise, they herald the joy of the Future
 


Later the solitude vanished, confused and distracted the road 
Where many were seeking and jostling. Left behind were the trees and the flowers, 
The half-realized beauty of quiet, the sacred unconscious communing. 
And now he is come to a river, a line of gray, sullen water, 
Not blue and splashing, but dark, rolling somberly on to the ocean. 
But on the far side is a city whose windows flame gold in the sunset. 
It lies fair and shining before him, a gem set betwixt sky and water, 
And spanning the river a bridge, frail promise to longing desire, 
Flung by man in his infinite courage, across the stern force of the water; 
And he looks at the river and fears, the bridge is so slight, yet he ventures 
His life to its fragile keeping, if it fails the waves will engulf him. 
O Arches! be strong to uphold him, and bear him across to the city, 
The beautiful city whose spires still glow with the fires of sunset


The whole thing is a jumble
How government works is funny here
It works for every kobo to leak
Into the trap someone laid
And the citizens are worse for it.

In their own thinking
There's no hope for today
The children who ought to see to it
Wear saggy pants, spiky hair
And addicts of European leagues of football
Amen


This kill, 
strive, hurt, 
screams echod on
for help.
shreaking nails abroad.
hurt chills, 
shrilling thrives
cutting edge
im dieing, 
you left me sadden
standing still
false substance burns heart, 
torn between cofusion. 

The way is difficult and very intricate.
Lalla discarded her books that told
about it, and through meditation
saw the truth that never comes
to anyone from reading words. 

With her fingers she turns paint
into flowers, with her body
flowers into a remembrance
of herself. She is at work
always, mending the garment
of our marriage, foraging
like a bird for something
for us to eat. If there are thorns
in my life, it is she who
will press her breast to them and sing.

Her words, when she would scold,
are too sharp. She is busy
after for hours rubbing smiles
into the wounds. I saw her,
when young, and spread the panoply
of my feathers instinctively
to engage her. She was not deceived,
but accepted me as a girl
will under a thin moon
in love's absence as someone
she could build a home with
for her imagined child. 

Just yesterday afternoon I heard a man
Say he lived in a house with no windows
The door of which was locked on the outside.
This was at a party in New York, New York.
A deep Oriental type, I said to myself,
One of them indescribable Tebootans who
Habitate on Quaker Heights and drink
Mulled kvass first thing every morning
With their vitamins. An asshole. And
Haven't I more years than he? Haven't
I spent them looking out the window
At the trees? Oh the various trees.
They have looked back at me with their
Homely American faces: the hemlocks
And white birches of one of my transient
Homes, the catalpas and honey locusts
Of another, the sweet gum and bay and
Coffee trees, the hop hornbeam and the
Spindle tree, the dogwood, the great.
Horse chestnut, the overdressed pawpaw
Who is the gamin of that dominion.
Then, behind them, the forest, the sodality.
What pizzazz in their theorizing! How fat
The sentimentibilities of their hosannas!
I have looked at them out the window
So intently and persistently that always
My who-I-am has gone out among them
Where the fluttering ideas beckon. Yes,
We've been best friends these sixty-nine
Years, standing around this hot stove
Of a world, hawking, phewing, guffawing,
My dear ones, who will remember me
For a long, long time when I'm gone. 

A maiden sat at her window wide,
Pretty enough for a Prince's bride,
Yet nobody came to claim her.
She sat like a beautiful picture there,
With pretty bluebells and roses fair,
And jasmine-leaves to frame her.
And why she sat there nobody knows;
But this she sang as she plucked a rose,
The leaves around her strewing:
"I've time to lose and power to choose;
'T is not so much the gallant who woos,
But the gallant's WAY of wooing!"

A lover came riding by awhile,
A wealthy lover was he, whose smile
Some maids would value greatly -
A formal lover, who bowed and bent,
With many a high-flown compliment,
And cold demeanour stately,
"You've still," said she to her suitor stern,
"The 'prentice-work of your craft to learn,
If thus you come a-cooing.
I've time to lose and power to choose;
'T is not so much the gallant who woos,
As the gallant's WAY of wooing!"

A second lover came ambling by -
A timid lad with a frightened eye
And a colour mantling highly.
He muttered the errand on which he'd come,
Then only chuckled and bit his thumb,
And simpered, simpered shyly.
"No," said the maiden, "go your way;
You dare but think what a man would say,
Yet dare to come a-suing!
I've time to lose and power to choose;
'T is not so much the gallant who woos,
As the gallant's WAY of wooing!"

A third rode up at a startling pace -
A suitor poor, with a homely face -
No doubts appeared to bind him.
He kissed her lips and he pressed her waist,
And off he rode with the maiden, placed
On a pillion safe behind him.
And she heard the suitor bold confide
This golden hint to the priest who tied
The knot there's no undoing;
With pretty young maidens who can choose,
'T is not so much the gallant who woos,
As the gallant's WAY of wooing!


"is by admitting 
or opening away. 
This is the simplest form 
of current: Blue 
moving through blue; 
blue through purple; 
the objects of desire 
opening upon themselves 
without us; the objects of faith. 
The way things work 
is by solution, 
resistance lessened or 
increased and taken 
advantage of. 
The way things work 
is that we finally believe 
they are there, 
common and able 
o illustrate themselves. 
Wheel, kinetic flow, 
rising and falling water, 
ingots, levers and keys, 
I believe in you, 
cylinder lock, pully, 
lifting tackle and 
crane lift your small head-- 
I believe in you--
your head is the horizon to
my hand. I believe 
forever in the hooks. 
The way things work 
is that eventually 
something catches. 

They shut the road through the woods
Seventy years ago.
Weather and rain have undone it again,
And now you would never know
There was once a road through the woods
Before they planted the trees.
It is underneath the coppice and heath,
And the thin anemones.
Only the keeper sees
That, where the ring-dove broods,
And the badgers roll at ease,
There was once a road through the woods.

Yet, if you enter the woods
Of a summer evening late,
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools
Where the otter whistles his mate.
(They fear not men in the woods,
Because they see so few)
You will hear the beat of a horse's feet,
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,
Steadily cantering through
The misty solitudes,
As though they perfectly knew
The old lost road through the woods. . . .
But there is no road through the woods. 

The way you make me feel, 

I never imagine we having long conversation, 
The hours we spent I would never forsake or forget them.
Getting to know you as a person, 
Is truly a blessing.
We started off as friends, 
But for you I had greater feelings.

I like you for you, 
Funny, Intelligent and I enjoyed hearing your view.
I have seen your worth, 
A diamond hidden deep down in the earth.

Whenever you are around, 
I find it easy to let my hair down.
You never judge me.
You always love me.

You always say I deserve better, 
And honestly, I call you my Greatest Inspirator.
My Motto.  .  
It stuck with me since primary school.
Nothing But the Best.
You are my best, 
And the most dropp dead gorgeous person could never contest.

Now I know my love experience is minute, 
Your smile, yours lips, your teeth look so cute.


Love entered in my heart one day, 
A sad, unwelcome guest; 
But when he begged that he might stay, 
I let him wait and rest.
He broke my sleep with sorrowing, 
And shook my dreams with tears, 
And when my heart was fain to sing, 
He stilled its joy with fears.

But now that he has gone his way, 
I miss the old sweet pain, 
And sometimes in the night I pray 
That he may come again. 

The beauty of the world hath made me sad,
This beauty that will pass; 
Sometimes my heart hath shaken with great joy
To see a leaping squirrel in a tree,
Or a red lady-bird upon a stalk,
Or little rabbits in a field at evening,
Lit by a slanting sun,
Or some green hill where shadows drifted by
Some quiet hill where mountainy man hath sown
And soon would reap; near to the gate of Heaven; 
Or children with bare feet upon the sands
Of some ebbed sea, or playing on the streets
Of little towns in Connacht,
Things young and happy.
And then my heart hath told me:
These will pass,
Will pass and change, will die and be no more,
Things bright and green, things young and happy; 
And I have gone upon my way
Sorrowful. 

The ways are green with the gladdening sheen
Of the young year's fairest daughter.
O, the shadows that fleet o'er the springing wheat!
O, the magic of running water!
The spirit of spring is in every thing,
The banners of spring are streaming,
We march to a tune from the fifes of June,
And life's a dream worth dreaming.

It's all very well to sit and spell
At the lesson there's no gainsaying;
But what the deuce are wont and use
When the whole mad world's a-maying?
When the meadow glows, and the orchard snows,
And the air's with love-motes teeming,
When fancies break, and the senses wake,
O, life's a dream worth dreaming!

What Nature has writ with her lusty wit
Is worded so wisely and kindly
That whoever has dipped in her manuscript
Must up and follow her blindly.
Now the summer prime is her blithest rhyme
In the being and the seeming,
And they that have heard the overword
Know life's a dream worth dreaming. 


The Ways of the Mind

Against the thorns
Grazing, 
To the honeyed rose
The bee flew
A-buzzing! 

With the breeze
 Swaying
Was the pretty rose-
And at the bee it
Sighed with  envy.


"How I wish
I were the bee
Flying so free
And not bound
To the ground
Like the piteous me


So thought the flower
In its bower.

"How I wish
I were a flower
Cupping the sweet nectar
And bound
To the ground
Without having to fly
All day long


So sang the bee
By the lea.


From above
The Omniscient smiled
At the strange ways of the mind-
For were not each of them
Now interchanged—
The flower having been the bee
And the bee having been the flower
In their previous birth and longed so

My right side is the stronger 
Of this body that I own.
All through the day it guides me; 
A dependence I have grown: 

Writes the cheques I cannot cash, 
And blocks the blessed rain, 
Washes me and feeds me, 
But it doesn't heal the pain.

My left side is the weaker 
Of this body that I own.
All through the night it hides me; 
The only love that I have known: 

Holds a knife while shaking
And the pain it takes away.
Left tries all to free me, 
But my right side wants to stay. 

Droning a drowsy syncopated tune, 
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon, 
I heard a Negro play. 
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night 
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light 
He did a lazy sway . . 
He did a lazy sway . . 
To the tune o' those Weary Blues. 
With his ebony hands on each ivory key 
He made that poor piano moan with melody. 
O Blues! 
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool 
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool. 
Sweet Blues! 
Coming from a black man's soul. 
O Blues! 
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone 
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan-- 
"Ain't got nobody in all this world, 
Ain't got nobody but ma self. 
I's gwine to quit ma frownin' 
And put ma troubles on the shelf
 


Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor. 
He played a few chords then he sang some more-- 
"I got the Weary Blues 
And I can't be satisfied. 
Got the Weary Blues 
And can't be satisfied-- 
I ain't happy no mo' 
And I wish that I had died
 

And far into the night he crooned that tune. 
The stars went out and so did the moon. 
The singer stopped playing and went to bed 
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head. 
He slept like a rock or a man that's dead. 

The weary one, orphan
of the masses, the self,
the crushed one, the one made of concrete,
the one without a country in crowded restaurants,
he who wanted to go far away, always farther away,
didn't know what to do there, whether he wanted
or didn't want to leave or remain on the island,
the hesitant one, the hybrid, entangled in himself,
had no place here: the straight-angled stone,
the infinite look of the granite prism,
the circular solitude all banished him:
he went somewhere else with his sorrows,
he returned to the agony of his native land,
to his indecisions, of winter and summer. 

I wove the words
The forgotten ways
I spun a web
Of the memory's days
I wished you well
What will be was
Words woke in the whim of the wild love


O marriage-bells, your clamor tells
 Two weddings in one breath.
SHE marries whom her love compels:
 -- And I wed Goodman Death!
My brain is blank, my tears are red;
And I would that I were dead.
Come groomsman Grief and bridesmaid Pain
Come and stand with a ghastly twain.
My Bridegroom Death is come o'er the meres
To wed a bride with bloody tears.
Ring, ring, O bells, full merrily:
Life-bells to her, death-bells to me:
O Death, I am true wife to thee

i wake up early dawn
to witness the changes in sky
from darkness to morn
for a new bride tonight..

the pain is still here
with sadness and anger
today may be the end
tomorrow is never a fine..

this man who'll be my groom
is as good as Homer
a monster from the north
captured me as his lover..

i never love this man before
but he never let me go
he give me no freedom
only to find.. 

i love him too

for all those days of confusions
my hours filled with loneliness
all i see is his perfect love
a true love which is always the best. 

perhaps it's just a fair 
to think that i am a bride to be
morning comes with no illusion
a celebration for wedding anniversary..

and as the ceremony starts
my eyes filled with tears
he is lying in white satin
while everybody stands with me. 

today.  

as we celebrate our anniversary
no other words i can say
i love you so much 
'happy silver wedding anniversary'The girl smiled and said: What
is the secret of this gold ring,
the secret of this ring that so tightly
embraces my finger,
the secret of this band
that sparkles and shines so?
the man was startled and said:
it's the ring of good fortune, the ring of life.

Everyone said: Congratulations and best wishes!
the girl said: Alas
that I still have doubts about its meaning.

The years passed, and one night
a downhearted woman looked at that gold band
and saw in its gleaming pattern
days wasted in hopes of husbandly fidelity,
days totally wasted.

The woman grew agitated and cried out:
O my, this ring that
still sparkles and shines
is the band of slavery and servitude. 

When Mardi Gras wooed Pantomime
they danced through all the streets, 
the gods, whose Credo was the time
sent fireworks as treats.

As time does not stand still, you see
beauty unlocked the door
allowing spirits to be free
and scribes record the lore.

From New Orleans to Times bright squares
Verona, then to Rome
ignoring gawkers and their stares
so far away from home.

With sequined custumes everywhere
spark-lit harlequinade, 
of apple shapes or stately pear
enlivened the charade.

As slapstick played with comedy
Toto digging out yellow road bricks, 
and under the rainbow's canopy
there was Lion who juggled his tricks.

*****************************

Paparazzi were shuttled in
lenses clicked at the dropp of a pin.
There was always a crush
for celebrity lush, 
cover page means you fight 'til you win.

Many dwarves did attend the event, 
Mardi Gras, in a wagon or tent.
Pantomime at the door
for today and for more, 
'twas Uranus who claimed love is meant.

Pink chrysanthemums tickling the paws
of Koalas (to flaunt local laws) , 
there was Tarzan who stripped, 
a much shorter, tight-lipped
Popeye Sailor, who's singing the Bla's.

Theatre audiences, all were in awe
crowds were screaming, 'Mesdames, nous adore'
came Dionysos too
and the Socrates crew
Cleopatra not wearing a bra.

***********************************

As blue smoke pirouettes to the sky, 
and the quivers from Burgundy moan, 
there's a lady who flashes her thigh
and a tightrope surrounded by stone.

with their bitches performing as maids
Monkey saw, monkey do dancing scenes
of Can


Can in their petticoat shades.

Seven dwarves with Snow White and fresh tears, 
Pantomime on a horse of pure white, 
dressed in blue are the three musketeers
bearing lanterns to light up the night.

Cinderella threw slippers, she knew, 
there would come a young lad to her aid, 
not a mermaid she needed her shoe
her two sisters preferred masquerade.

Twas a wedding to beat all events, 
as white rabbits tossed roses around, 
there was Romeo, near the big tent
little Blueboy asleep on the ground.

There was art, there was craft on the stage
and the witch had brought Haensel to town
and trapezes swung high in a cage, 
Big Bad Wolf was dressed up in a gown.

On the banks of the river so blue
Papa bear from the Yellowstone Hills, 
little Bambi and


Skippy the 'roo, 
they were smiling amidst all the frills.
 


When Mardi Gras wooed Pantomime
and led her out the door, 
she turned and said: ' I give this rhyme, 
myself, and so much more; 
I pledge my body and my soul
to you my Mardi Gras
and if you like I shall be whole, 
discard my finest bra, 
and, like a wedge of Maasdam Cheese
I slip right in between, 
to have you kiss my cleavage (please)   
outside the mens' latrine.'

So now you've learnt the history
of how these lovers met, 
and not a hint of misery
a perfect match was set.

When LOVE itself joins hand to hand
no end will ever come, 
and all of us must understand
the music of our drum.




at the foot of the chancel steps, with my beloved,
and the minister stood on the top step
holding the open Bible. The church
stable perfectly cleaned. It was night,
spring—outside, a moat of mud,
and inside, from the rafters, flies
fell onto the open Bible, and the minister
tilted it and brushed them off. We stood
beside each other, crying slightly
with fear and awe. In truth, we had married
that first night, in bed, we had been
married by our bodies, but now we stood
in history—what our bodies had said,
mouth to mouth, we now said publicly,
gathered together, death. We stood
holding each other by the hand, yet I also
stood as if alone, for a moment,
just before the vow, though taken
years before, took. It was a vow
of the present and the future, and yet I felt it
to have some touch on the distant past
or the distant past on it, I felt
the silent, dry, crying ghost of my
parents' marriage there, somewhere
in the bright space—perhaps one of the
plummeting flies, bouncing slightly
as it hit forsaking all others, then was brushed
away. I felt as if I had come
to claim a promise—the sweetness I'd inferred
from their sourness; and at the same time that I had
come, congenitally unworthy, to beg.
And yet, I had been working toward this hour
all my life. And then it was time
to speak—he was offering me, no matter
what, his life. That is all I had to
do, that evening, to accept the gift
I had longed for—to say I had accepted it,
as if being asked if I breathe. Do I take?
I do. I take as he takes—we have been
practicing this. Do you bear this pleasure? I do. 


The dark lantern of world sadness has cast its shadow upon the land.

We stumble into our misery on leaden feet.

Our minds seek to comprehend the unknowable and our hearts seek to

Measure a tomorrow without the Sunshine Princess.

Her hands which had held bright tiaras and jewelled crowns,

Also stroked the faces of pain along

Angola's dusty roads.

She was born to the privilege of plenty

Yet, she communed with the needy without a show of pompous piety.

Glowing in Bosnia, radiant at glittering balls,

We came to love her and claim her for her grace and accessibility.

Luminous always.

We smiled to see her enter and grinned at her happiness.

Now the world we made is forever changed-

Made smaller, meaner, less colorful.

Yet, because she did live,

Because she ventured life and confronted change,

She has left us a legacy.

We also may dare-

To care for some other than ourselves and those who look like us.

And maybe we can take a lesson from her

And try to live our lives

With passion, compassion, humor and grace.


Goodbye Sunshine Princess. 

She kneels by the cradle 
Singing, Lullaby, my Baby! 
But why dost Thou cry? 

The babes of the village 
Smile sweetly in sleep; 
And lullaby, my Baby, 
That ever dost weep! 

I've wrapped Thee in linen, 
The gift of the Kings; 
And wool, soft and fleecy, 
The kind Shepherd brings. 

Whom naught can defile; 
All gifts will I give Thee 
An thou wilt but smile. 

But it's lullaby, my Baby! 
And mournful am I, 
That still Thou wilt cry. 


Witnessing the blood baths, the massacre 
And octogenarians expire slowly and quietly in horror.
The undistorted and the vivid images of terror, 
The ugly realities of life for millions; what a rancor! 
The large plumes of gray phosphorus smoke! There is nowhere 
To hide. Showers of shrapnel, unprecedented heavy shellings, 
White clouds of death and discriminating lynchings
Of everything that breathes, walks, runs and flies; 
Where are they when they are needed? 
Our world should not be so muted, 
So insensitive toward so many.
This is a shameful disaster, a pity-
To do nothing and hope for the awakening of the gods; 
The worms, the flies, the rats and the tods
Must be happy. What an inhumane feast! 
In this young century, we cannot find Peace.
The photos are real, and dying is not a joke.
The lenses of the camera recorded the blood soaked
Pregnant women, their babies shredded
By the wrecked fires of the big guns.
No one is spared: fathers, mothers, sons, 
And even young girls are arrested, 
Humiliated, stepped on and eventually annihilated.
This is the state of our human family.
Centuries old victims are now the perpetrated
Beasts that devour nymphs, angels and dignity.
The moon can only helplessly weep, 
The gods and the geese are high by the burning bodies.
Terrorism is your vocation; falling asleep, 
Amid this, is criminal, we should unequivocally denounce the bullies.
Big gun shipped helicopters can only destroy; they don’t make Peace, 
H bombs only create more activists, more militants and more beasts. 

After the final no there comes a yes
And on that yes the future world depends.
No was the night. Yes is this present sun.
If the rejected things, the things denied,
Slid over the western cataract, yet one,
One only, one thing that was firm, even
No greater than a cricket's horn, no more
Than a thought to be rehearsed all day, a speech
Of the self that must sustain itself on speech,
One thing remaining, infallible, would be
Enough. Ah! douce campagna of that thing!
Ah! douce campagna, honey in the heart,
Green in the body, out of a petty phrase,
Out of a thing believed, a thing affirmed:
The form on the pillow humming while one sleeps,
The aureole above the humming house. 
It can never be satisfied, the mind, never. 

The well rising without sound, 
the spring on a hillside, 
the plowshare brimming through deep ground 
everywhere in the field— 


The sharp swallows in their swerve 
flaring and hesitating 
hunting for the final curve 
coming closer and closer— 


The swallow heart from wingbeat to wingbeat 
counseling decisions, decision: 
thunderous examples. I place my feet 
with care in such a world. 

They hasten, still they hasten,
From the even to the dawn;
And their tired eyes gleam and glisten
Under north skies white and wan.
Each panter in the darkness
Is a demon-haunted soul,
The shadowy, phantom werewolves,
Who circle round the Pole.
 
Their tongues are crimson flaming,
Their haunted blue eyes gleam,
And they strain them to the utmost
O'er frozen lake and stream;
Their cry one note of agony,
That is neither yelp nor bark,
These panters of the northern waste,
Who hound them to the dark.
 
You may hear their hurried breathing,
You may see their fleeting forms,
At the pallid polar midnight,
When the north is gathering storms;
When the arctic frosts are flaming,
And the ice-field thunders roll;
These demon-haunted werewolves,
Who circle round the Pole.
 
They hasten, still they hasten,
Across the northern night,
Filled with a frighted madness,
A horror of the light;
Forever and forever,
Like leaves before the wind,
They leave the wan, white gleaming
Of the dawning far behind.
 
Their only peace is darkness,
Their rest to hasten on
Into the heart of midnight,
Forever from the dawn.
Across far phantom ice-floes
The eye of night may mark
These horror-haunted werewolves
Who hound them to the dark.
 
All through this hideous journey
They are the souls of men
Who in the far dark-ages
Made Europe one black fen.
They fled from courts and convents,
And bound their mortal dust
With demon, wolfish girdles
Of human hate and lust.
 
These, who could have been godlike,
Chose, each a loathsome beast,
Amid the heart's foul graveyards,
On putrid thoughts to feast;
Gave each a human soul,
And so 'mid night forever
They circle round the Pole.
 
A-praying for the blackness,
A-longing for the night,
For each is doomed forever
By a horror of the light;
And far in the heart of midnight,
Where their shadowy flight is hurled,
They feel with pain the dawning
That creeps in round the world.
 
Under the northern midnight,
The white, glint ice upon,
They hasten, still they hasten,
With their horror of the dawn;
Forever and forever,
Into the night away
They hasten, still they hasten
Unto the judgment day. 

When the waters' countenance
Blurs 'twixt glance and second glance;
When our tattered smokes forerun
Ashen 'neath a silvered sun;
When the curtain of the haze
Shuts upon our helpless ways--
   Hear the Channel Fleet at sea:
   Libera nos Domine!

When the engines' bated pulse
Scarcely thrills the nosing hulls;
When the wash along the side
Sounds, a-sudden, magnified;
When the intolerable blast
Marks each blindfold minute passed;

When the fog-buoy's squattering flight
Guides us 'through the haggard night;
When the warning bugle blows;
When the lettered doorway's close;
When our brittle townships press,
Impotent, on emptiness;

When the unseen leadsmen lean
Questioning a deep unseen;
When their lessened count they tell
To a bridge invisible;
When the hid and perilous
Cliffs return our cry to us;

When the treble thickness spread
Swallows up our next-ahead;
When her sirens frightened whine 
Shows her sheering out of line;
When--her passage undiscerned--
We must turn where she has turned,
Hear the Channel Fleet at sea:
Libera nos Domine


It was a convenient circle of friends
. .. 

A medium circle of friends - tried and true
A celebration of like minds, if you will
An ever turning wheel of achievements - old and new; 


With no beginning and no end
. .. 

Revolution's happening - twentyfour - seven
.  . . 

Sunrise to sunset
Reaching each new goal - their heaven; 


From the first breath of Spring
. .. 

To the icy of Winter's last snow
From the shimmering of Summer's shoulder's
To the Autumn and it's oft' amber glow; 


It was the perfect circle of friend's
. .. 

An ever turning - forever kind of wheel
Of morning, afternoon and evening cog's
And everything in their 'life's news reel'; 


It was a marriage of vows taken in secrecy
. .. 

By the light of the full moon and stars
Promise's made and kept never to break
A wheel of non suffering tyrant's with no battle scars; 




I hear the whine of my dying brothers
Yon’, I feel  pain of my crying sisters.
we Sat all night at prison doors & wept
Like soldiers, whose eyes haven’t slept.

Brothers who‘ve survived many struck, 
Lay in canoes, the deepest sea to duck, 
few reached seashore to be slain & pelt.
Whence did we lay, & beaten by belt? 

Ages, our forefather didn’t fight alone, 
Though bruised & bitten to the bones? 
this place, thousands of brothers slain
today our hearts still live in fear & pains

Who’d despised our kind, if not the west? 
Men despise our lives, values, they jest, 
finding pleasure in writing tales of death, 
rush to witness horrors grow on the earth.

Oh! bro we live in a world of bitterness
that gibes, try to bring us to nothingness
If not, why sisters & daughters whoring, 
sons, husbands trapped in their dungeons? 



I am letting you go
Not like a cry
But bit by bit
Like life


I will not toy with it nor bend an inch. 
Deep in the secret chambers of my heart 
I muse my life-long hate, and without flinch 
I bear it nobly as I live my part. 
My being would be a skeleton, a shell, 
If this dark Passion that fills my every mood, 
And makes my heaven in the white world's hell, 
Did not forever feed me vital blood. 
I see the mighty city through a mist-- 
The strident trains that speed the goaded mass, 
The poles and spires and towers vapor-kissed, 
The fortressed port through which the great ships pass, 
The tides, the wharves, the dens I contemplate, 
Are sweet like wanton loves because I hate. 

HIGH on a point of rugged ground
Among the wastes of Rylstone Fell
Above the loftiest ridge or mound
Where foresters or shepherds dwell,
An edifice of warlike frame
Stands single--Norton Tower its name--
It fronts all quarters, and looks round
O'er path and road, and plain and dell, 
Dark moor, and gleam of pool and stream,
Upon a prospect without bound.
The summit of this bold ascent--
Though bleak and bare, and seldom free
As Pendle-hill or Pennygent
From wind, or frost, or vapours wet--
Had often heard the sound of glee
When there the youthful Nortons met,
To practise games and archery:
How proud and happy they! the crowd 
Of Lookers-on how pleased and proud!
And from the scorching noon-tide sun,
From showers, or when the prize was won,
They to the Tower withdrew, and there
Would mirth run round, with generous fare;
Was happiest, proudest, of them all!
But now, his Child, with anguish pale,
Upon the height walks to and fro;
'Tis well that she hath heard the tale, 
Received the bitterness of woe:
For she 'had' hoped, had hoped and feared,
Such rights did feeble nature claim;
And oft her steps had hither steered,
Though not unconscious of self-blame;
For she her brother's charge revered,
His farewell words; and by the same,
Yea by her brother's very name,
Had, in her solitude, been cheered.
Beside the lonely watch-tower stood 
That grey-haired Man of gentle blood,
Who with her Father had grown old
In friendship; rival hunters they,
And fellow warriors in their day;
To Rylstone he the tidings brought;
Then on this height the Maid had sought,
And, gently as he could, had told
The end of that dire Tragedy,
Which it had been his lot to see.
To him the Lady turned; 'You said 
That Francis lives, 'he' is not dead?'
'Your noble brother hath been spared;
To take his life they have not dared;
On him and on his high endeavour
The light of praise shall shine for ever!
Nor did he (such Heaven's will) in vain
His solitary course maintain;
Not vainly struggled in the might
Of duty, seeing with clear sight;
He was their comfort to the last, 
Their joy till every pang was past.
I witnessed when to York they came--
What, Lady, if their feet were tied;
They might deserve a good Man's blame;
But marks of infamy and shame--
These were their triumph, these their pride;
Nor wanted 'mid the pressing crowd
Deep feeling, that found utterance loud,
'Lo, Francis comes,' there were who cried,
'A Prisoner once, but now set free! 
'Tis well, for he the worst defied
Through force of natural piety;
He rose not in this quarrel; he,
For concord's sake and England's good,
Suit to his Brothers often made
With tears, and of his Father prayed--
And when he had in vain withstood
Their purpose--then did he divide,
He parted from them; but at their side
Now walks in unanimity. 
Then peace to cruelty and scorn,
While to the prison they are borne,
Peace, peace to all indignity!'
And so in Prison were they laid--
Oh hear me, hear me, gentle Maid,
For I am come with power to bless,
By scattering gleams, through your distress,
Of a redeeming happiness.
Me did a reverent pity move
And privilege of ancient love; 
And, in your service, making bold,
Entrance I gained to that stronghold.
Your Father gave me cordial greeting;
But to his purposes, that burned
Within him, instantly returned:
He was commanding and entreating,
And said--'We need not stop, my Son!
Thoughts press, and time is hurrying on'--
And so to Francis he renewed
His words, more calmly thus pursued. 
'Might this our enterprise have sped,
Change wide and deep the Land had seen,
A renovation from the dead,
A spring-tide of immortal green:
The darksome altars would have blazed
Like stars when clouds are rolled away;
Salvation to all eyes that gazed,
Once more the Rood had been upraised
To spread its arms, and stand for aye.
Then, then--had I survived to see 
New life in Bolton Priory;
The voice restored, the eye of Truth
Re-opened that inspired my youth;
To see her in her pomp arrayed--
This Banner (for such vow I made)
Should on the consecrated breast
Of that same Temple have found rest:
I would myself have hung it high,
Fit offering of glad victory!
A shadow of such thought remains 
To cheer this sad and pensive time;
A solemn fancy yet sustains
One feeble Being--bids me climb
Even to the last--one effort more
To attest my Faith, if not restore.
Hear then,' said he, 'while I impart,
My Son, the last wish of my heart.
The Banner strive thou to regain;
And, if the endeavour prove not vain,
Bear it--to whom if not to thee 
Shall I this lonely thought consign?--
Bear it to Bolton Priory,
And lay it on Saint Mary's shrine;
To wither in the sun and breeze
'Mid those decaying sanctities.
There let at least the gift be laid,
The testimony there displayed;
Bold proof that with no selfish aim,
I helmeted a brow though white, 
And took a place in all men's sight;
Yea offered up this noble Brood,
This fair unrivalled Brotherhood,
And turned away from thee, my Son!
And left--but be the rest unsaid,
The name untouched, the tear unshed;--
My wish is known, and I have done:
Now promise, grant this one request,
This dying prayer, and be thou blest!'
Then Francis answered--'Trust thy Son, 
The pledge obtained, the solemn word
Thus scarcely given, a noise was heard,
And Officers appeared in state
To lead the prisoners to their fate.
They rose, oh! wherefore should I fear
To tell, or, Lady, you to hear?
They rose--embraces none were given--
They stood like trees when earth and heaven
Are calm; they knew each other's worth, 
And reverently the Band went forth.
They met, when they had reached the door,
One with profane and harsh intent
Placed there--that he might go before
And, with that rueful Banner borne
Aloft in sign of taunting scorn,
Conduct them to their punishment:
So cruel Sussex, unrestrained
By human feeling, had ordained.
The unhappy Banner Francis saw, 
And, with a look of calm command
Inspiring universal awe,
He took it from the soldier's hand;
And all the people that stood round
Confirmed the deed in peace profound.
--High transport did the Father shed
Upon his Son--and they were led,
Led on, and yielded up their breath;
Together died, a happy death!--
But Francis, soon as he had braved 
That insult, and the Banner saved,
Athwart the unresisting tide
Of the spectators occupied
In admiration or dismay,
Bore instantly his Charge away.'
These things, which thus had in the sight
And hearing passed of Him who stood
With Emily, on the Watch-tower height,
In Rylstone's woeful neighbourhood,
He told; and oftentimes with voice 
Of power to comfort or rejoice;
For deepest sorrows that aspire,
Go high, no transport ever higher.
The old Man to the silent Maid,
'Yet, Lady! shines, through this black night,
One star of aspect heavenly bright;
Your Brother lives--he lives--is come
Perhaps already to his home;
Then let us leave this dreary place.' 
She yielded, and with gentle pace,
Though without one uplifted look,
To Rylstone-hall her way she took. 

FROM Bolton's old monastic tower
The bells ring loud with gladsome power;
The sun shines bright; the fields are gay
With people in their best array
Of stole and doublet, hood and scarf,
Along the banks of crystal Wharf,
Through the Vale retired and lowly,
Trooping to that summons holy.
And, up among the moorlands, see
What sprinklings of blithe company! 
Of lasses and of shepherd grooms,
That down the steep hills force their way,
Like cattle through the budded brooms;
Path, or no path, what care they?
And thus in joyous mood they hie
To Bolton's mouldering Priory.
What would they there?--Full fifty years
That sumptuous Pile, with all its peers,
Too harshly hath been doomed to taste
The bitterness of wrong and waste: 
Its courts are ravaged; but the tower
Is standing with a voice of power,
That ancient voice which wont to call
To mass or some high festival;
And in the shattered fabric's heart
Remaineth one protected part;
A Chapel, like a wild-bird's nest,
Closely embowered and trimly drest;
And thither young and old repair,
This Sabbath-day, for praise and prayer. 
Fast the churchyard fills;--anon
Look again, and they all are gone;
The cluster round the porch, and the folk
Who sate in the shade of the Prior's Oak!
And scarcely have they disappeared
Ere the prelusive hymn is heard:--
With one consent the people rejoice,
Filling the church with a lofty voice!
They sing a service which they feel:
For 'tis the sunrise now of zeal; 
Of a pure faith the vernal prime--
In great Eliza's golden time.
A moment ends the fervent din,
And all is hushed, without and within;
For though the priest, more tranquilly,
Recites the holy liturgy,
The only voice which you can hear
Is the river murmuring near.
--When soft!--the dusky trees between,
And down the path through the open green, 
Where is no living thing to be seen;
And through yon gateway, where is found,
Beneath the arch with ivy bound,
Free entrance to the churchyard ground--
Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,
Comes gliding in serene and slow,
Soft and silent as a dream,
A solitary Doe!
White she is as lily of June,
And beauteous as the silver moon 
When out of sight the clouds are driven
And she is left alone in heaven;
Or like a ship some gentle day
In sunshine sailing far away,
A glittering ship, that hath the plain
Of ocean for her own domain.
Lie silent in your graves, ye dead!
Lie quiet in your churchyard bed!
Ye living, tend your holy cares;
Ye multitude, pursue your prayers; 
And blame not me if my heart and sight
Are occupied with one delight!
'Tis a work for sabbath hours
If I with this bright Creature go:
Whether she be of forest bowers,
From the bowers of earth below;
Or a Spirit for one day given,
A pledge of grace from purest heaven.
What harmonious pensive changes
Wait upon her as she ranges 
Round and through this Pile of state
Overthrown and desolate!
Now a step or two her way
Leads through space of open day,
Where the enamoured sunny light
Brightens her that was so bright;
Now doth a delicate shadow fall,
Falls upon her like a breath,
From some lofty arch or wall,
As she passes underneath: 
Now some gloomy nook partakes
Of the glory that she makes,--
High-ribbed vault of stone, or cell,
With perfect cunning framed as well
Of stone, and ivy, and the spread
Of the elder's bushy head;
Some jealous and forbidding cell,
That doth the living stars repel,
And where no flower hath leave to dwell.
The presence of this wandering Doe 
Fills many a damp obscure recess
With lustre of a saintly show;
And, reappearing, she no less
Sheds on the flowers that round her blow
A more than sunny liveliness.
But say, among these holy places,
Which thus assiduously she paces,
Comes she with a votary's task,
Rite to perform, or boon to ask?
Fair Pilgrim! harbours she a sense 
Of sorrow, or of reverence?
Can she be grieved for quire or shrine,
Crushed as if by wrath divine?
Was worshipped, or where Man abode;
For old magnificence undone;
Or for the gentler work begun
By Nature, softening and concealing,
And busy with a hand of healing?
Mourns she for lordly chamber's hearth 
That to the sapling ash gives birth;
For dormitory's length laid bare
Where the wild rose blossoms fair;
Or altar, whence the cross was rent,
Now rich with mossy ornament?
--She sees a warrior carved in stone,
Among the thick weeds, stretched alone;
A warrior, with his shield of pride
Cleaving humbly to his side,
And hands in resignation prest, 
Palm to palm, on his tranquil breast;
As little she regards the sight
As a common creature might:
If she be doomed to inward care,
Or service, it must lie elsewhere.
--But hers are eyes serenely bright,
And on she moves--with pace how light!
Nor spares to stoop her head, and taste
The dewy turf with flowers bestrown;
And thus she fares, until at last 
Beside the ridge of a grassy grave
In quietness she lays her down;
Gentle as a weary wave
Sinks, when the summer breeze hath died,
Against an anchored vessel's side;
Even so, without distress, doth she
Lie down in peace, and lovingly.
The day is placid in its going,
To a lingering motion bound,
Like the crystal stream now flowing 
With its softest summer sound:
So the balmy minutes pass,
While this radiant Creature lies
Couched upon the dewy grass,
Pensively with downcast eyes.
--But now again the people raise
With awful cheer a voice of praise;
It is the last, the parting song;
And from the temple forth they throng,
And quickly spread themselves abroad, 
While each pursues his several road.
But some--a variegated band
Of middle-aged, and old, and young,
And little children by the hand
Upon their leading mothers hung--
With mute obeisance gladly paid
Turn towards the spot, where, full in view,
The white Doe, to her service true,
Her sabbath couch has made.
It was a solitary mound; 
Which two spears' length of level ground
Did from all other graves divide:
As if in some respect of pride;
Or melancholy's sickly mood,
Still shy of human neighbourhood;
Or guilt, that humbly would express
A penitential loneliness.
'Look, there she is, my Child! draw near;
She fears not, wherefore should we fear?
She means no harm;'--but still the Boy, 
To whom the words were softly said,
Hung back, and smiled, and blushed for joy,
A shame-faced blush of glowing red!
Again the Mother whispered low,
'Now you have seen the famous Doe;
From Rylstone she hath found her way
Over the hills this sabbath day
Her work, whate'er it be, is done,
And she will depart when we are gone;
Thus doth she keep, from year to year, 
Her sabbath morning, foul or fair.'
Bright was the Creature, as in dreams
The Boy had seen her, yea, more bright;
But is she truly what she seems?
He asks with insecure delight,
Asks of himself, and doubts,--and still
The doubt returns against his will:
Though he, and all the standers-by,
Could tell a tragic history
Of facts divulged, wherein appear 
Substantial motive, reason clear,
Why thus the milk-white Doe is found
Couchant beside that lonely mound;
And why she duly loves to pace
The circuit of this hallowed place.
Nor to the Child's inquiring mind
Is such perplexity confined:
For, spite of sober Truth that sees
A world of fixed remembrances
Which to this mystery belong, 
If, undeceived, my skill can trace
The characters of every face,
There lack not strange delusion here,
Conjecture vague, and idle fear,
And superstitious fancies strong,
Which do the gentle Creature wrong.
That bearded, staff-supported Sire--
Who in his boyhood often fed
Full cheerily on convent-bread
And heard old tales by the convent-fire, 
And to his grave will go with scars,
Relics of long and distant wars--
That Old Man, studious to expound
The spectacle, is mounting high
To days of dim antiquity;
When Lady Aaliza mourned
Her Son, and felt in her despair
The pang of unavailing prayer;
Her Son in Wharf's abysses drowned,
The noble Boy of Egremound. 
From which affliction--when the grace
A pious structure, fair to see
Rose up, this stately Priory!
The Lady's work;--but now laid low;
To the grief of her soul that doth come and go,
In the beautiful form of this innocent Doe:
Which, though seemingly doomed in its breast to sustain
A softened remembrance of sorrow and pain,
Is spotless, and holy, and gentle, and bright; 
And glides o'er the earth like an angel of light.
Pass, pass who will, yon chantry door;
And, through the chink in the fractured floor
Look down, and see a griesly sight;
A vault where the bodies are buried upright!
There, face by face, and hand by hand,
The Claphams and Mauleverers stand;
And, in his place, among son and sire,
Is John de Clapham, that fierce Esquire,
A valiant man, and a name of dread 
In the ruthless wars of the White and Red;
Who dragged Earl Pembroke from Banbury church
And smote off his head on the stones of the porch!
Look down among them, if you dare;
Oft does the White Doe loiter there,
Prying into the darksome rent;
Nor can it be with good intent:
So thinks that Dame of haughty air,
Who hath a Page her book to hold,
And wears a frontlet edged with gold. 
Harsh thoughts with her high mood agree--
Who counts among her ancestry
Earl Pembroke, slain so impiously!
That slender Youth, a scholar pale,
From Oxford come to his native vale,
He also hath his own conceit:
It is, thinks he, the gracious Fairy,
Who loved the Shepherd-lord to meet
In his wanderings solitary:
Wild notes she in his hearing sang, 
A song of Nature's hidden powers;
That whistled like the wind, and rang
Among the rocks and holly bowers.
'Twas said that She all shapes could wear;
And oftentimes before him stood,
Amid the trees of some thick wood,
In semblance of a lady fair;
And taught him signs, and showed him sights,
In Craven's dens, on Cumbrian heights;
When under cloud of fear he lay, 
A shepherd clad in homely grey;
Nor left him at his later day.
And hence, when he, with spear and shield,
Rode full of years to Flodden-field,
His eye could see the hidden spring,
And how the current was to flow;
The fatal end of Scotland's King,
And all that hopeless overthrow.
But not in wars did he delight,
'This' Clifford wished for worthier might; 
Nor in broad pomp, or courtly state;
Him his own thoughts did elevate,--
Most happy in the shy recess
Of Barden's lowly quietness.
And choice of studious friends had he
Of Bolton's dear fraternity;
Who, standing on this old church tower,
In many a calm propitious hour,
Perused, with him, the starry sky;
Or, in their cells, with him did pry 
For other lore,--by keen desire
Urged to close toil with chemic fire;
In quest belike of transmutations
Rich as the mine's most bright creations.
But they and their good works are fled,
And all is now disquieted--
And peace is none, for living or dead!
Ah, pensive Scholar, think not so,
But look again at the radiant Doe!
What quiet watch she seems to keep, 
Alone, beside that grassy heap!
Why mention other thoughts unmeet
For vision so composed and sweet?
While stand the people in a ring,
Gazing, doubting, questioning;
Yea, many overcome in spite
Of recollections clear and bright;
Which yet do unto some impart
An undisturbed repose of heart.
And all the assembly own a law 
Of orderly respect and awe;
But see--they vanish one by one,
And last, the Doe herself is gone.
Harp! we have been full long beguiled
By vague thoughts, lured by fancies wild;
To which, with no reluctant strings,
Thou hast attuned thy murmurings;
And now before this Pile we stand
In solitude, and utter peace:
But, Harp! thy murmurs may not cease-- 
A Spirit, with his angelic wings,
In soft and breeze-like visitings,
Has touched thee--and a Spirit's hand:
A voice is with us--a command
To chant, in strains of heavenly glory,
A tale of tears, a mortal story

THE Harp in lowliness obeyed;
And first we sang of the greenwood shade
And a solitary Maid;
Beginning, where the song must end, 
With her, and with her sylvan Friend;
The Friend who stood before her sight,
Her only unextinguished light;
Her last companion in a dearth
Of love, upon a hopeless earth.
For She it was--this Maid, who wrought
Meekly, with foreboding thought,
In vermeil colours and in gold
An unblest work; which, standing by,
Her Father did with joy behold,-- 
Exulting in its imagery;
A Banner, fashioned to fulfil
Too perfectly his headstrong will:
For on this Banner had her hand
Embroidered (such her Sire's command)
The sacred Cross; and figured there
Full soon to be uplifted high,
And float in rueful company!
Twelve years had reigned, a Sovereign dread;
Nor yet the restless crown had been
Disturbed upon her virgin head;
But now the inly-working North
Was ripe to send its thousands forth,
A potent vassalage, to fight
In Percy's and in Neville's right,
Two Earls fast leagued in discontent,
Who gave their wishes open vent;
And boldly urged a general plea, 
The rites of ancient piety
To be triumphantly restored,
By the stern justice of the sword!
And that same Banner, on whose breast
The blameless Lady had exprest
Memorials chosen to give life
And sunshine to a dangerous strife;
That Banner, waiting for the Call,
Stood quietly in Rylstone-hall.
It came; and Francis Norton said, 
'O Father! rise not in this fray--
The hairs are white upon your head;
Dear Father, hear me when I say
It is for you too late a day!
Bethink you of your own good name:
A pure religion, and the claim
Of peace on our humanity.--
'Tis meet that I endure your scorn;
I am your son, your eldest born; 
But not for lordship or for land,
My Father, do I clasp your knees;
The Banner touch not, stay your hand,
This multitude of men disband,
And live at home in blameless ease;
For these my brethren's sake, for me;
And, most of all, for Emily!'
Tumultuous noises filled the hall;
And scarcely could the Father hear
That name--pronounced with a dying fall-- 
The name of his only Daughter dear,
As on the banner which stood near
He glanced a look of holy pride,
And his moist eyes were glorified;
Then did he seize the staff, and say:
'Thou, Richard, bear'st thy father's name,
Keep thou this ensign till the day
When I of thee require the same:
Thy place be on my better hand;--
And seven as true as thou, I see, 
Will cleave to this good cause and me.'
He spake, and eight brave sons straightway
All followed him, a gallant band!
Thus, with his sons, when forth he came
The sight was hailed with loud acclaim
And din of arms and minstrelsy,
From all his warlike tenantry,
All horsed and harnessed with him to ride,--
A voice to which the hills replied!
But Francis, in the vacant hall, 
Stood silent under dreary weight,--
A phantasm, in which roof and wall
Shook, tottered, swam before his sight;
A phantasm like a dream of night!
Thus overwhelmed, and desolate,
He found his way to a postern-gate;
And, when he waked, his languid eye
Was on the calm and silent sky;
With air about him breathing sweet,
And earth's green grass beneath his feet; 
Nor did he fail ere long to hear
A sound of military cheer,
Faint--but it reached that sheltered spot;
He heard, and it disturbed him not.
There stood he, leaning on a lance
Which he had grasped unknowingly,
Had blindly grasped in that strong trance,
That dimness of heart-agony;
There stood he, cleansed from the despair
And sorrow of his fruitless prayer. 
The past he calmly hath reviewed:
But where will be the fortitude
Of this brave man, when he shall see
That Form beneath the spreading tree,
And know that it is Emily?
He saw her where in open view
She sate beneath the spreading yew--
Her head upon her lap, concealing
In solitude her bitter feeling:
'Might ever son 'command' a sire, 
The act were justified to-day.'
This to himself--and to the Maid,
Whom now he had approached, he said--
'Gone are they,--they have their desire;
And I with thee one hour will stay,
To give thee comfort if I may.'
She heard, but looked not up, nor spake;
And sorrow moved him to partake
Her silence; then his thoughts turned round,
And fervent words a passage found. 
'Gone are they, bravely, though misled;
With a dear Father at their head!
The Sons obey a natural lord;
The Father had given solemn word
To noble Percy; and a force
Still stronger, bends him to his course.
This said, our tears to-day may fall
As at an innocent funeral.
In deep and awful channel runs
This sympathy of Sire and Sons; 
Untried our Brothers have been loved
With heart by simple nature moved;
And now their faithfulness is proved:
For faithful we must call them, bearing
That soul of conscientious daring.
--There were they all in circle--there
John with a sword that will not fail,
And those bright Twins were side by side; 
And there, by fresh hopes beautified,
Stood He, whose arm yet lacks the power
Of man, our youngest, fairest flower!
I, by the right of eldest born,
And in a second father's place,
Presumed to grapple with their scorn,
And meet their pity face to face;
I to my Father knelt and prayed;
Methought, was yielding inwardly,
And would have laid his purpose by,
But for a glance of his Father's eye,
Which I myself could scarcely brook.
Then be we, each and all, forgiven!
Thou, chiefly thou, my Sister dear,
Whose pangs are registered in heaven--
The stifled sigh, the hidden tear,
And smiles, that dared to take their place,
Meek filial smiles, upon thy face, 
As that unhallowed Banner grew
Beneath a loving old Man's view.
Thy part is done--thy painful part;
Be thou then satisfied in heart!
A further, though far easier, task
Than thine hath been, my duties ask;
With theirs my efforts cannot blend,
I cannot for such cause contend;
Their aims I utterly forswear;
But I in body will be there. 
Unarmed and naked will I go,
Be at their side, come weal or woe:
On kind occasions I may wait,
See, hear, obstruct, or mitigate.
Bare breast I take and an empty hand.'--
Therewith he threw away the lance,
Which he had grasped in that strong trance,
Spurned it, like something that would stand
Between him and the pure intent
Of love on which his soul was bent. 
'For thee, for thee, is left the sense
Of trial past without offence
Such consolation, and the excess
Of an unmerited distress;
In that thy very strength must lie.
--O Sister, I could prophesy!
The time is come that rings the knell
Of all we loved, and loved so well:
Hope nothing, if I thus may speak 
To thee, a woman, and thence weak:
Hope nothing, I repeat; for we
Are doomed to perish utterly:
'Tis meet that thou with me divide
The thought while I am by thy side,
Acknowledging a grace in this,
A comfort in the dark abyss.
But look not for me when I am gone,
And be no farther wrought upon:
Farewell all wishes, all debate, 
All prayers for this cause, or for that!
Weep, if that aid thee; but depend
Upon no help of outward friend;
Espouse thy doom at once, and cleave
To fortitude without reprieve.
For we must fall, both we and ours--
This Mansion and these pleasant bowers,
Walks, pools, and arbours, homestead, hall--
Our fate is theirs, will reach them all;
The young horse must forsake his manger, 
And learn to glory in a Stranger;
The hawk forget his perch; the hound
Be parted from his ancient ground:
The blast will sweep us all away--
One desolation, one decay!
And even this Creature!' which words saying,
He pointed to a lovely Doe,
A few steps distant, feeding, straying;
Fair creature, and more white than snow!
'Even she will to her peaceful woods 
Return, and to her murmuring floods,
And be in heart and soul the same
She was before she hither came;
Ere she had learned to love us all,
Herself beloved in Rylstone-hall.
--But thou, my Sister, doomed to be
The last leaf on a blasted tree;
If not in vain we breathed the breath
Together of a purer faith;
If hand in hand we have been led, 
And thou, (O happy thought this day
Not seldom foremost in the way;
If on one thought our minds have fed,
And we have in one meaning read;
If, when at home our private weal
Hath suffered from the shock of zeal,
Together we have learned to prize
Forbearance and self-sacrifice;
If we like combatants have fared,
And for this issue been prepared; 
If thou art beautiful, and youth
And thought endue thee with all truth--
Be strong;--be worthy of the grace
A Soul, by force of sorrows high,
Uplifted to the purest sky
Of undisturbed humanity!'
He ended,--or she heard no more;
He led her from the yew-tree shade,
And at the mansion's silent door, 
He kissed the consecrated Maid;
And down the valley then pursued,
Alone, the armed Multitude.

'Powers there are
That touch each other to the quick--in modes
Which the gross world no sense hath to perceive,
No soul to dream of.'

THOU Spirit, whose angelic hand
Was to the harp a strong command,
Called the submissive strings to wake
In glory for this Maiden's sake,
Say, Spirit! whither hath she fled
To hide her poor afflicted head?
What mighty forest in its gloom
Enfolds her?--is a rifted tomb
Within the wilderness her seat?
Some island which the wild waves beat-- 
Is that the Sufferer's last retreat?
Or some aspiring rock, that shrouds
Its perilous front in mists and clouds?
High-climbing rock, low sunless dale,
Sea, desert, what do these avail?
Oh take her anguish and her fears
Into a deep recess of years!
'Tis done;--despoil and desolation
O'er Rylstone's fair domain have blown;
Pools, terraces, and walks are sown 
With weeds; the bowers are overthrown,
Or have given way to slow mutation,
While, in their ancient habitation
The Norton name hath been unknown.
The lordly Mansion of its pride
Is stripped; the ravage hath spread wide
Through park and field, a perishing
That mocks the gladness of the Spring!
And, with this silent gloom agreeing,
Appears a joyless human Being, 
Of aspect such as if the waste
Were under her dominion placed.
Upon a primrose bank, her throne
Of quietness, she sits alone;
Among the ruins of a wood,
Erewhile a covert bright and green,
And where full many a brave tree stood,
That used to spread its boughs, and ring
With the sweet bird's carolling.
Neglecting in imperial state
These outward images of fate,
And carrying inward a serene
And perfect sway, through many a thought
Of chance and change, that hath been brought
To the subjection of a holy,
Though stern and rigorous, melancholy!
The like authority, with grace
Of awfulness, is in her face,--
There hath she fixed it; yet it seems 
To o'ershadow by no native right
That face, which cannot lose the gleams,
Lose utterly the tender gleams,
Of gentleness and meek delight,
And loving-kindness ever bright:
Such is her sovereign mien:--her dress
(A vest with woollen cincture tied,
A hood of mountain-wool undyed)
Is homely,--fashioned to express
A wandering Pilgrim's humbleness. 
And she 'hath' wandered, long and far,
Beneath the light of sun and star;
Hath roamed in trouble and in grief,
Driven forward like a withered leaf,
Yea like a ship at random blown
To distant places and unknown.
But now she dares to seek a haven
Among her native wilds of Craven;
Hath seen again her Father's roof,
And put her fortitude to proof; 
The mighty sorrow hath been borne,
And she is thoroughly forlorn:
Her soul doth in itself stand fast,
Sustained by memory of the past
And strength of Reason; held above
The infirmities of mortal love;
Undaunted, lofty, calm, and stable,
And awfully impenetrable.
And so--beneath a mouldered tree,
A self-surviving leafless oak 
By unregarded age from stroke
Of ravage saved--sate Emily.
There did she rest, with head reclined,
Herself most like a stately flower,
(Such have I seen) whom chance of birth
Hath separated from its kind,
To live and die in a shady bower,
Single on the gladsome earth.
When, with a noise like distant thunder,
A troop of deer came sweeping by; 
And, suddenly, behold a wonder!
For One, among those rushing deer,
A single One, in mid career
Hath stopped, and fixed her large full eye
Upon the Lady Emily;
A Doe most beautiful, clear-white,
A radiant creature, silver-bright!
Thus checked, a little while it stayed;
A little thoughtful pause it made;
And then advanced with stealth-like pace, 
Drew softly near her, and more near--
Looked round--but saw no cause for fear;
So to her feet the Creature came,
And laid its head upon her knee,
And looked into the Lady's face,
A look of pure benignity,
And fond unclouded memory.
It is, thought Emily, the same,
The very Doe of other years!--
The pleading look the Lady viewed, 
And, by her gushing thoughts subdued,
She melted into tears--
A flood of tears, that flowed apace,
Upon the happy Creature's face.
Oh, moment ever blest! O Pair
Beloved of Heaven, Heaven's chosen care,
This was for you a precious greeting;
And may it prove a fruitful meeting!
Joined are they, and the sylvan Doe
Can she depart? can she forego 
The Lady, once her playful peer,
And now her sainted Mistress dear?
And will not Emily receive
This lovely chronicler of things
Long past, delights and sorrowings?
Lone Sufferer! will not she believe
The promise in that speaking face;
And welcome, as a gift of grace,
The saddest thought the Creature brings?
That day, the first of a re-union 
Which was to teem with high communion,
That day of balmy April weather,
They tarried in the wood together.
And when, ere fall of evening dew,
She from her sylvan haunt withdrew,
The White Doe tracked with faithful pace
The Lady to her dwelling-place;
That nook where, on paternal ground,
A habitation she had found,
The Master of whose humble board 
A hut, by tufted trees defended,
Where Rylstone brook with Wharf is blended.
When Emily by morning light
Went forth, the Doe stood there in sight.
She shrunk:--with one frail shock of pain
Received and followed by a prayer,
She saw the Creature once again;
Shun will she not, she feels, will bear;--
But, wheresoever she looked round, 
All now was trouble-haunted ground;
And therefore now she deems it good
Once more this restless neighbourhood
To leave.--Unwooed, yet unforbidden,
The White Doe followed up the vale,
Up to another cottage, hidden
In the deep fork of Amerdale;
And there may Emily restore
Herself, in spots unseen before.
--Why tell of mossy rock, or tree, 
By lurking Dernbrook's pathless side,
Haunts of a strengthening amity
That calmed her, cheered, and fortified?
For she hath ventured now to read
Of time, and place, and thought, and deed--
Endless history that lies
In her silent Follower's eyes;
Who with a power like human reason
Discerns the favourable season,
Skilled to approach or to retire,-- 
From looks conceiving her desire;
From look, deportment, voice, or mien,
That vary to the heart within.
If she too passionately wreathed
Her arms, or over-deeply breathed,
Walked quick or slowly, every mood
In its degree was understood;
Then well may their accord be true,
And kindliest intercourse ensue.
--Oh! surely 'twas a gentle rousing 
When she by sudden glimpse espied
The White Doe on the mountain browsing,
Or in the meadow wandered wide!
How pleased, when down the Straggler sank
Beside her, on some sunny bank!
How soothed, when in thick bower enclosed,
They, like a nested pair, reposed!
Fair Vision! when it crossed the Maid
Within some rocky cavern laid,
The dark cave's portal gliding by, 
White as whitest cloud on high
Floating through the azure sky.
--What now is left for pain or fear?
That Presence, dearer and more dear,
While they, side by side, were straying,
And the shepherd's pipe was playing,
Did now a very gladness yield
At morning to the dewy field,
And with a deeper peace endued
The hour of moonlight solitude. 
With her Companion, in such frame
Of mind, to Rylstone back she came;
And, ranging through the wasted groves,
Received the memory of old loves,
Undisturbed and undistrest,
Into a soul which now was blest
With a soft spring-day of holy,
Mild, and grateful, melancholy:
Not sunless gloom or unenlightened,
But by tender fancies brightened. 
When the bells of Rylstone played
That was the sound they seemed to speak;
Inscriptive legend which I ween
May on those holy bells be seen,
That legend and her Grandsire's name;
And oftentimes the Lady meek
Had in her childhood read the same;
Words which she slighted at that day;
But now, when such sad change was wrought, 
And of that lonely name she thought--
The bells of Rylstone seemed to say,
While she sate listening in the shade,
And all the hills were glad to bear
Their part in this effectual prayer.
Nor lacked she Reason's firmest power;
But with the White Doe at her side
Up would she climb to Norton Tower,
And thence look round her far and wide, 
Her fate there measuring;--all is stilled,--
The weak One hath subdued her heart;
Behold the prophecy fulfilled,
Fulfilled, and she sustains her part!
But here her Brother's words have failed;
Here hath a milder doom prevailed;
That she, of him and all bereft,
Hath yet this faithful Partner left;
This one Associate, that disproves
His words, remains for her, and loves. 
If tears are shed, they do not fall
For loss of him--for one, or all;
Yet, sometimes, sometimes doth she weep
Moved gently in her soul's soft sleep;
A few tears down her cheek descend
For this her last and living Friend.
Bless, tender Hearts, their mutual lot,
And bless for both this savage spot;
Which Emily doth sacred hold
For reasons dear and manifold-- 
Here hath she, here before her sight,
Close to the summit of this height,
The grassy rock-encircled Pound
In which the Creature first was found.
So beautiful the timid Thrall
(A spotless Youngling white as foam)
Her youngest Brother brought it home;
The youngest, then a lusty boy,
Bore it, or led, to Rylstone-hall
With heart brimful of pride and joy! 
But most to Bolton's sacred Pile,
On favouring nights, she loved to go;
There ranged through cloister, court, and aisle,
Attended by the soft-paced Doe;
Nor feared she in the still moonshine
To look upon Saint Mary's shrine;
Nor on the lonely turf that showed
Where Francis slept in his last abode.
For that she came; there oft she sate
Forlorn, but not disconsolate: 
And, when she from the abyss returned
Of thought, she neither shrunk nor mourned;
Was happy that she lived to greet
Her mute Companion as it lay
In love and pity at her feet;
How happy in its turn to meet
The recognition! the mild glance
Beamed from that gracious countenance;
Communication, like the ray
Of a new morning, to the nature 
And prospects of the inferior Creature!
A mortal Song we sing, by dower
Encouraged of celestial power;
Power which the viewless Spirit shed
By whom we were first visited;
Whose voice we heard, whose hand and wings
Swept like a breeze the conscious strings,
When, left in solitude, erewhile
We stood before this ruined Pile,
And, quitting unsubstantial dreams, 
Sang in this Presence kindred themes;
Distress and desolation spread
Through human hearts, and pleasure dead,--
Dead--but to live again on earth,
A second and yet nobler birth;
Dire overthrow, and yet how high
The re-ascent in sanctity!
From fair to fairer; day by day
A more divine and loftier way!
Even such this blessed Pilgrim trod, 
Uplifted to the purest sky
Of undisturbed mortality.
Her own thoughts loved she; and could bend
A dear look to her lowly Friend;
There stopped; her thirst was satisfied
With what this innocent spring supplied:
Her sanction inwardly she bore,
And stood apart from human cares:
But to the world returned no more, 
Although with no unwilling mind
Help did she give at need, and joined
The Wharfdale peasants in their prayers.
At length, thus faintly, faintly tied
To earth, she was set free, and died.
Thy soul, exalted Emily,
Maid of the blasted family,
--In Rylstone Church her mortal frame
Was buried by her Mother's side. 
Most glorious sunset! and a ray
Survives--the twilight of this day--
In that fair Creature whom the fields
Support, and whom the forest shields;
Who, having filled a holy place,
Partakes, in her degree, Heaven's grace;
And bears a memory and a mind
Raised far above the law of kind;
Haunting the spots with lonely cheer
Which her dear Mistress once held dear: 
Loves most what Emily loved most--
The enclosure of this churchyard ground;
Here wanders like a gliding ghost,
And every sabbath here is found;
Comes with the people when the bells
Are heard among the moorland dells,
Finds entrance through yon arch, where way
Lies open on the sabbath-day;
Here walks amid the mournful waste
Of prostrate altars, shrines defaced, 
And floors encumbered with rich show
Of fret-work imagery laid low;
Paces softly, or makes halt,
By fractured cell, or tomb, or vault;
By plate of monumental brass
Dim-gleaming among weeds and grass,
And sculptured Forms of Warriors brave:
But chiefly by that single grave,
That one sequestered hillock green,
The pensive visitant is seen. 
There doth the gentle Creature lie
With those adversities unmoved;
Calm spectacle, by earth and sky
In their benignity approved!
And aye, methinks, this hoary Pile,
Subdued by outrage and decay,
Looks down upon her with a smile,
A gracious smile, that seems to say--
'Thou, thou art not a Child of Time,
But Daughter of the Eternal Prime!


'WHY comes not Francis?--From the doleful City
He fled,--and, in his flight, could hear
The death-sounds of the Minster-bell:
That sullen stroke pronounced farewell
To Ambrose that! and then a knell
For him, the sweet half-opened Flower! 
For all--all dying in one hour!
--Why comes not Francis? Thoughts of love
Should bear him to his Sister dear
With the fleet motion of a dove;
Yea, like a heavenly messenger
Of speediest wing, should he appear.
Why comes he not?--for westward fast
Along the plain of York he past;
Reckless of what impels or leads,
Unchecked he hurries on;--nor heeds 
The sorrow, through the Villages,
Spread by triumphant cruelties
Of vengeful military force,
And punishment without remorse.
He marked not, heard not, as he fled
All but the suffering heart was dead
For him abandoned to blank awe,
To vacancy, and horror strong:
And the first object which he saw,
With conscious sight, as he swept along-- 
It was the Banner in his hand!
He felt--and made a sudden stand.
He looked about like one betrayed:
What hath he done? what promise made?
Oh weak, weak moment! to what end
Can such a vain oblation tend,
And he the Bearer?--Can he go
Carrying this instrument of woe,
And find, find anywhere, a right
To excuse him in his Country's sight? 
No; will not all men deem the change
A downward course, perverse and strange?
Here is it;--but how? when? must she,
The unoffending Emily,
Again this piteous object see?
Such conflict long did he maintain,
Nor liberty nor rest could gain:
His own life into danger brought
By this sad burden--even that thought,
Exciting self-suspicion strong 
Swayed the brave man to his wrong.
And how--unless it were the sense
Of all-disposing Providence,
Its will unquestionably shown--
How has the Banner clung so fast
To a palsied, and unconscious hand;
Clung to the hand to which it passed
Without impediment? And why,
But that Heaven's purpose might be known,
Doth now no hindrance meet his eye, 
No intervention, to withstand
Fulfilment of a Father's prayer
Breathed to a Son forgiven, and blest
When all resentments were at rest,
And life in death laid the heart bare?--
Then, like a spectre sweeping by,
Rushed through his mind the prophecy
Of utter desolation made
To Emily in the yew-tree shade:
He sighed, submitting will and power 
To the stern embrace of that grasping hour.
'No choice is left, the deed is mine--
Dead are they, dead!--and I will go,
And, for their sakes, come weal or woe,
Will lay the Relic on the shrine.'
So forward with a steady will
He went, and traversed plain and hill;
And up the vale of Wharf his way
Pursued;--and, at the dawn of day,
Attained a summit whence his eyes 
Could see the Tower of Bolton rise.
There Francis for a moment's space
Made halt--but hark! a noise behind
Of horsemen at an eager pace!
He heard, and with misgiving mind.
--'Tis Sir George Bowes who leads the Band:
They come, by cruel Sussex sent;
Who, when the Nortons from the hand
Of death had drunk their punishment,
Bethought him, angry and ashamed, 
How Francis, with the Banner claimed
As his own charge, had disappeared,
By all the standers-by revered.
His whole bold carriage (which had quelled
Thus far the Opposer, and repelled
All censure, enterprise so bright
That even bad men had vainly striven
Against that overcoming light)
Was then reviewed, and prompt word given,
That to what place soever fled 
He should be seized, alive or dead.
The troop of horse have gained the height
Where Francis stood in open sight.
They hem him round--'Behold the proof,'
They cried, 'the Ensign in his hand!
'He' did not arm, he walked aloof!
For why?--to save his Father's land;--
Worst Traitor of them all is he,
A Traitor dark and cowardly!'
'I am no Traitor,' Francis said, 
'Though this unhappy freight I bear;
And must not part with. But beware;--
Err not by hasty zeal misled,
Nor do a suffering Spirit wrong,
Whose self-reproaches are too strong!'
At this he from the beaten road
Retreated towards a brake of thorn,
That like a place of vantage showed;
And there stood bravely, though forlorn.
In self-defence with warlike brow 
He stood,--nor weaponless was now;
He from a Soldier's hand had snatched
A spear,--and, so protected, watched
The Assailants, turning round and round;
But from behind with treacherous wound
A Spearman brought him to the ground.
The guardian lance, as Francis fell,
Dropped from him; but his other hand
The Banner clenched; till, from out the Band,
One, the most eager for the prize, 
Rushed in; and--while, O grief to tell!
A glimmering sense still left, with eyes
Unclosed the noble Francis lay--
Seized it, as hunters seize their prey;
But not before the warm life-blood
Had tinged more deeply, as it flowed,
The wounds the broidered Banner showed,
Thy fatal work, O Maiden, innocent as good!
Proudly the Horsemen bore away
The Standard; and where Francis lay 
There was he left alone, unwept,
And for two days unnoticed slept.
For at that time bewildering fear
Possessed the country, far and near;
But, on the third day, passing by
One of the Norton Tenantry
Espied the uncovered Corse; the Man
Shrunk as he recognised the face,
And to the nearest homesteads ran
And called the people to the place. 
--How desolate is Rylstone-hall!
This was the instant thought of all;
And if the lonely Lady there
Should be; to her they cannot bear
This weight of anguish and despair.
So, when upon sad thoughts had prest
Thoughts sadder still, they deemed it best
That, if the Priest should yield assent
And no one hinder their intent,
In holy ground a grave would make;
And straightway buried he should be
In the Churchyard of the Priory.
Apart, some little space, was made
The grave where Francis must be laid.
In no confusion or neglect
This did they,--but in pure respect
That he was born of gentle blood;
And that there was no neighbourhood
Of kindred for him in that ground: 
So to the Churchyard they are bound,
Bearing the body on a bier;
And psalms they sing--a holy sound
That hill and vale with sadness hear.
But Emily hath raised her head,
And is again disquieted;
She must behold!--so many gone,
Where is the solitary One?
And forth from Rylstone-hall stepped she,--
To seek her Brother forth she went, 
And tremblingly her course she bent
Toward Bolton's ruined Priory.
She comes, and in the vale hath heard
The funeral dirge;--she sees the knot
Of people, sees them in one spot--
And darting like a wounded bird
She reached the grave, and with her breast
Upon the ground received the rest,--
The consummation, the whole ruth
And sorrow of this final truth

NOW joy for you who from the towers
Of Brancepeth look in doubt and fear,
Telling melancholy hours!
Proclaim it, let your Masters hear
That Norton with his band is near!
The watchmen from their station high
Pronounced the word,--and the Earls descry, 
Well-pleased, the armed Company
Marching down the banks of Were.
Said fearless Norton to the pair
Gone forth to greet him on the plain--
I bring with me a goodly train;
Their hearts are with you: hill and dale
Have helped us: Ure we crossed, and Swale,
And horse and harness followed--see
The best part of their Yeomanry! 
--Stand forth, my Sons!--these eight are mine,
Whom to this service I commend;
Which way soe'er our fate incline,
These will be faithful to the end;
They are my all'--voice failed him here--
'My all save one, a Daughter dear!
Whom I have left, Love's mildest birth,
The meekest Child on this blessed earth.
I had--but these are by my side,
These Eight, and this is a day of pride! 
The time is ripe. With festive din
Lo! how the people are flocking in,--
Like hungry fowl to the feeder's hand
When snow lies heavy upon the land.'
He spake bare truth; for far and near
From every side came noisy swarms
Of Peasants in their homely gear;
And, mixed with these, to Brancepeth came
Grave Gentry of estate and name,
And Captains known for worth in arms 
And prayed the Earls in self-defence
To rise, and prove their innocence.--
'Rise, noble Earls, put forth your might
For holy Church, and the People's right!'
The Norton fixed, at this demand,
His eye upon Northumberland,
And said; 'The Minds of Men will own
No loyal rest while England's Crown
Remains without an Heir, the bait
Of strife and factions desperate; 
Who, paying deadly hate in kind
Through all things else, in this can find
A mutual hope, a common mind;
And plot, and pant to overwhelm
All ancient honour in the realm.
--Brave Earls! to whose heroic veins
Our noblest blood is given in trust,
To you a suffering State complains,
And ye must raise her from the dust.
With wishes of still bolder scope 
On you we look, with dearest hope;
Even for our Altars--for the prize,
In Heaven, of life that never dies;
For the old and holy Church we mourn,
And must in joy to her return.
Behold!'--and from his Son whose stand
Was on his right, from that guardian hand
He took the Banner, and unfurled
The precious folds--'behold,' said he,
'The ransom of a sinful world; 
Let this your preservation be;
The wounds of hands and feet and side,
--This bring I from an ancient hearth,
These Records wrought in pledge of love
By hands of no ignoble birth,
A Maid o'er whom the blessed Dove
Vouchsafed in gentleness to brood
While she the holy work pursued.'
'Uplift the Standard!' was the cry 
From all the listeners that stood round,
'Plant it,--by this we live or die.'
The Norton ceased not for that sound,
But said; 'The prayer which ye have heard,
Much-injured Earls! by these preferred,
Is offered to the Saints, the sigh
Of tens of thousands, secretly.'
'Uplift it!' cried once more the Band,
And then a thoughtful pause ensued:
'Uplift it!' said Northumberland-- 
Whereat, from all the multitude
Who saw the Banner reared on high
In all its dread emblazonry,
A voice of uttermost joy brake out:
The transport was rolled down the river of Were,
And Durham, the time-honoured Durham, did hear,
And the towers of Saint Cuthbert were stirred by the shout!
Now was the North in arms:--they shine
In warlike trim from Tweed to Tyne,
At Percy's voice: and Neville sees 
His Followers gathering in from Tees,
From Were, and all the little rills
Concealed among the forked hills--
Seven hundred Knights, Retainers all
Of Neville, at their Master's call
Had sate together in Raby Hall!
Such strength that Earldom held of yore;
Nor wanted at this time rich store
Of well-appointed chivalry.
--Not loth the sleepy lance to wield, 
And greet the old paternal shield,
They heard the summons;--and, furthermore,
Horsemen and Foot of each degree,
Unbound by pledge of fealty,
Appeared, with free and open hate
Of novelties in Church and State;
Knight, burgher, yeoman, and esquire;
And Romish priest, in priest's attire.
And thus, in arms, a zealous Band
Proceeding under joint command, 
To Durham first their course they bear;
And in Saint Cuthbert's ancient seat
Sang mass,--and tore the book of prayer,--
And trod the bible beneath their feet.
Thence marching southward smooth and free
'They mustered their host at Wetherby,
Full sixteen thousand fair to see,'
The Choicest Warriors of the North!
But none for beauty and for worth
Like those eight Sons--who, in a ring, 
(Ripe men, or blooming in life's spring)
Each with a lance, erect and tall,
A falchion, and a buckler small,
Stood by their Sire, on Clifford-moor,
To guard the Standard which he bore.
On foot they girt their Father round;
And so will keep the appointed ground
Where'er their march: no steed will he
Henceforth bestride;--triumphantly,
He stands upon the grassy sod, 
Rare sight to embolden and inspire!
Proud was the field of Sons and Sire;
Of him the most; and, sooth to say,
No shape of man in all the array
So graced the sunshine of that day.
The monumental pomp of age
Was with this goodly Personage;
A stature undepressed in size,
Unbent, which rather seemed to rise, 
In open victory o'er the weight
Of seventy years, to loftier height;
Magnific limbs of withered state;
A face to fear and venerate;
Eyes dark and strong; and on his head
Bright locks of silver hair, thick spread,
Which a brown morion half-concealed,
Light as a hunter's of the field;
And thus, with girdle round his waist,
Whereon the Banner-staff might rest 
At need, he stood, advancing high
The glittering, floating Pageantry.
Who sees him?--thousands see, and One
With unparticipated gaze;
Who, 'mong those thousands, friend hath none,
And treads in solitary ways.
He, following wheresoe'er he might,
Hath watched the Banner from afar,
As shepherds watch a lonely star,
Or mariners the distant light 
That guides them through a stormy night.
And now, upon a chosen plot
Of rising ground, yon heathy spot!
He takes alone his far-off stand,
With breast unmailed, unweaponed hand.
Bold is his aspect; but his eye
Is pregnant with anxiety,
While, like a tutelary Power,
He there stands fixed from hour to hour:
Yet sometimes in more humble guise, 
Upon the turf-clad height he lies
Stretched, herdsman-like, as if to bask
In sunshine were his only task,
Or by his mantle's help to find
A shelter from the nipping wind:
And thus, with short oblivion blest,
His weary spirits gather rest.
Again he lifts his eyes; and lo!
The pageant glancing to and fro;
And hope is wakened by the sight, 
He thence may learn, ere fall of night,
Which way the tide is doomed to flow.
To London were the Chieftains bent;
But what avails the bold intent?
A Royal army is gone forth
To quell the RISING OF THE NORTH;
They march with Dudley at their head,
And, in seven days' space, will to York be led!--
Can such a mighty Host be raised
Thus suddenly, and brought so near? 
The Earls upon each other gazed,
And Neville's cheek grew pale with fear;
For, with a high and valiant name,
He bore a heart of timid frame;
And bold if both had been, yet they
'Against so many may not stay.'
Back therefore will they hie to seize
A strong Hold on the banks of Tees
There wait a favourable hour,
From Naworth come; and Howard's aid
Be with them openly displayed.
While through the Host, from man to man,
A rumour of this purpose ran,
The Standard trusting to the care
Of him who heretofore did bear
That charge, impatient Norton sought
The Chieftains to unfold his thought,
And thus abruptly spake;--'We yield
(And can it be?) an unfought field!-- 
How oft has strength, the strength of heaven,
To few triumphantly been given!
Still do our very children boast
Of mitred Thurston--what a Host
He conquered!--Saw we not the Plain
(And flying shall behold again)
Where faith was proved?--while to battle moved
The Standard, on the Sacred Wain
That bore it, compassed round by a bold
Fraternity of Barons old; 
And with those grey-haired champions stood,
Under the saintly ensigns three,
The infant Heir of Mowbray's blood--
All confident of victory!--
Shall Percy blush, then, for his name?
Must Westmoreland be asked with shame
Whose were the numbers, where the loss,
In that other day of Neville's Cross?
When the Prior of Durham with holy hand
Raised, as the Vision gave command, 
Saint Cuthbert's Relic--far and near
Kenned on the point of a lofty spear;
While the Monks prayed in Maiden's Bower
Less would not at our need be due
To us, who war against the Untrue;--
The delegates of Heaven we rise,
Convoked the impious to chastise:
We, we, the sanctities of old
Would re-establish and uphold: 
Be warned'--His zeal the Chiefs confounded,
But word was given, and the trumpet sounded:
Back through the melancholy Host
Went Norton, and resumed his post.
Alas! thought he, and have I borne
This Banner raised with joyful pride,
This hope of all posterity,
By those dread symbols sanctified;
Thus to become at once the scorn
Of babbling winds as they go by, 
A spot of shame to the sun's bright eye,
To the light clouds a mockery!
--'Even these poor eight of mine would stem--'
Half to himself, and half to them
He spake--'would stem, or quell, a force
Ten times their number, man and horse:
This by their own unaided might,
Without their father in their sight,
Without the Cause for which they fight;
A Cause, which on a needful day 
Would breed us thousands brave as they.'
--So speaking, he his reverend head
Raised towards that Imagery once more:
But the familiar prospect shed
Despondency unfelt before:
A shock of intimations vain,
Dismay, and superstitious pain,
Fell on him, with the sudden thought
Of her by whom the work was wrought:--
Oh wherefore was her countenance bright 
With love divine and gentle light?
She would not, could not, disobey,
But her Faith leaned another way.
Ill tears she wept; I saw them fall,
I overheard her as she spake
Sad words to that mute Animal,
The White Doe, in the hawthorn brake;
She steeped, but not for Jesu's sake,
This Cross in tears: by her, and One
Unworthier far we are undone-- 
Her recreant Brother--he prevailed
Over that tender Spirit--assailed
Too oft, alas! by her whose head
In the cold grave hath long been laid:
She first, in reason's dawn beguiled
Her docile, unsuspecting Child:
Far back--far back my mind must go
To reach the well-spring of this woe!
While thus he brooded, music sweet
Of border tunes was played to cheer 
The footsteps of a quick retreat;
But Norton lingered in the rear,
Stung with sharp thoughts; and ere the last
From his distracted brain was cast,
Before his Father, Francis stood,
And spake in firm and earnest mood.
'Though here I bend a suppliant knee
In reverence, and unarmed, I bear
In your indignant thoughts my share;
Am grieved this backward march to see 
So careless and disorderly.
I scorn your Chiefs--men who would lead,
And yet want courage at their need:
Then look at them with open eyes!
Deserve they further sacrifice?--
If--when they shrink, nor dare oppose
In open field their gathering foes,
(And fast, from this decisive day,
Yon multitude must melt away
If now I ask a grace not claimed 
While ground was left for hope; unblamed
Be an endeavour that can do
No injury to them or you.
My Father! I would help to find
A place of shelter, till the rage
Of cruel men do like the wind
Exhaust itself and sink to rest;
Be Brother now to Brother joined!
Admit me in the equipage
Of your misfortunes, that at least, 
Whatever fate remain behind,
I may bear witness in my breast
To your nobility of mind!'
'Thou Enemy, my bane and blight!
Oh! bold to fight the Coward's fight
Against all good'--but why declare,
At length, the issue of a prayer
Which love had prompted, yielding scope
Too free to one bright moment's hope?
Suffice it that the Son, who strove 
With fruitless effort to allay
That passion, prudently gave way;
Nor did he turn aside to prove
His Brothers' wisdom or their love--
But calmly from the spot withdrew;
His best endeavours to renew,
Should e'er a kindlier time ensue. 



IN trellised shed with clustering roses gay,
And, MARY! oft beside our blazing fire,
When yeas of wedded life were as a day
Whose current answers to the heart's desire,
Did we together read in Spenser's Lay
How Una, sad of soul--in sad attire,
The gentle Una, of celestial birth,
To seek her Knight went wandering o'er the earth.

Ah, then, Beloved! pleasing was the smart,
And the tear precious in compassion shed 
For Her, who, pierced by sorrow's thrilling dart,
Did meekly bear the pang unmerited;
Meek as that emblem of her lowly heart
The milk-white Lamb which in a line she led,--
And faithful, loyal in her innocence,
Like the brave Lion slain in her defence.

Notes could we hear as of a faery shell
Attuned to words with sacred wisdom fraught;
Free Fancy prized each specious miracle,
And all its finer inspiration caught; 
Till in the bosom of our rustic Cell,
We by a lamentable change were taught
That 'bliss with mortal Man may not abide:'
How nearly joy and sorrow are allied!

For us the stream of fiction ceased to flow,
For us the voice of melody was mute.
--But, as soft gales dissolve the dreary snow,
And give the timid herbage leave to shoot,
Heaven's breathing influence failed not to bestow
A timely promise of unlooked-for fruit, 
Fair fruit of pleasure and serene content
From blossoms wild of fancies innocent.

It soothed us--it beguiled us--then, to hear
Once more of troubles wrought by magic spell;
And griefs whose aery motion comes not near
The pangs that tempt the Spirit to rebel:
Then, with mild Una in her sober cheer,
High over hill and low adown the dell
Again we wandered, willing to partake

Then, too, this Song 'of mine' once more could please,
Where anguish, strange as dreams of restless sleep,
Is tempered and allayed by sympathies
Aloft ascending, and descending deep,
Even to the inferior Kinds; whom forest-trees
Protect from beating sunbeams, and the sweep
Of the sharp winds;--fair Creatures!--to whom Heaven
A calm and sinless life, with love, hath given.

This tragic Story cheered us; for it speaks
Of female patience winning firm repose; 
And, of the recompense that conscience seeks,
A bright, encouraging, example shows;
Needful when o'er wide realms the tempest breaks,
Needful amid life's ordinary woes;--
Hence, not for them unfitted who would bless
A happy hour with holier happiness.



He serves the Muses erringly and ill,
Whose aim is pleasure light and fugitive:
Oh, that my mind were equal to fulfil
The comprehensive mandate which they give-- 
Vain aspiration of an earnest will!
Yet in this moral Strain a power may live,
Beloved Wife! such solace to impart
As it hath yielded to thy tender heart.



'Action is transitory--a step, a blow,
The motion of a muscle--this way or that--
'Tis done; and in the after-vacancy
We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed:
Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark,
And has the nature of infinity.
Yet through that darkness (infinite though it seem
And irremoveable) gracious openings lie,
By which the soul--with patient steps of thought
Now toiling, waked now on wings of prayer-- 
May pass in hope, and, though from mortal bonds
Yet undelivered, rise with sure ascent
Even to the fountain-head of peace divine.


'Take up the White man's burden --
  Send forth the best ye breed --
Go bind your sons to exile
  To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness
  On fluttered folk and wild --
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
  Half devil and half child.

Take up the White Man's burden --
  In patience to abide,
To veil the threat of terror
  And check the show of pride;
By open speech and simple,
  An hundred times mad plain.
To seek another's profit,
  And work another's gain.

Take up the White Man's burden --
  The savage wars of peace --
Fill full the mouth of Famine
  And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
  The end for others sought,
Watch Sloth and heathen Folly
  Bring all your hope to nought.


Take up the White Man's burden --
  No tawdry rule of kings,
But toil of serf and sweeper --
  The tale of common things.
The ports ye shall not enter,
  The roads ye shall not tread,
Go make them with your living,
  And mark them with your dead!

Take up the White man's burden --
  And reap his old reward:
The blame of those ye better,
  The hate of those ye guard --
The cry of hosts ye humour
  (Ah, slowly!) toward the light: --
"Why brought ye us from bondage,
  "Our loved Egyptian night?"

Take up the White Man's burden --
  Ye dare not stoop to less --
Nor call too loud on freedom
  To cloak your weariness;
By all ye cry or whisper,
  By all ye leave or do,
The silent, sullen peoples

Take up the White Man's burden --
  Have done with childish days --
The lightly proffered laurel,
  The easy, ungrudged praise.
Comes now, to search your manhood
  Through all the thankless years,
Cold-edged with dear-bought wisdom,
  The judgment of your peers


Lost in the forest, I broke off a dark twig
and lifted its whisper to my thirsty lips:
maybe it was the voice of the rain crying,
a cracked bell, or a torn heart.

Something from far off it seemed
deep and secret to me, hidden by the earth,
a shout muffled by huge autumns,
by the moist half-open darkness of the leaves.

Wakening from the dreaming forest there, the hazel-sprig
sang under my tongue, its drifting fragrance
climbed up through my conscious mind

as if suddenly the roots I had left behind
cried out to me, the land I had lost with my childhood---
and I stopped, wounded by the wandering scent


The white rose and the red rose,
So sisters two were named, yes, named.
The white one was so quiet,
The red one laughed and flamed.
But different was their doing, yes,
When came the time of wooing, yes.
The white one turned so red, so red,
The red one turned so white.

For him the red one favored,
Him father would not bless, not bless.
But him the white one favored,
He got at once his 'Yes.'
The red one now was paling, yes,
With sorrow, psalms, and wailing, yes.
The white one turned so red, so red,
The red one turned so white.

Then father grew so fearful
And had to give his 'Yes,' oh, yes!
With songs and music cheerful
The wedding rang, oh, yes!
And soon sprang children rosen, yes,
In shoes and little hosen, yes.
The red one's, they were white,-and oh,
The white one's, they were red. 

Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,
And black are the waters that sparkled so green.
The moon, o'er the combers, looks downward to find us
At rest in the hollows that rustle between.
Where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow;
Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!
The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,
Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas.

You mustn't swim till you're six weeks old,
Or your head will be sunk by your heels;
And summer gales and Killer Whales
Are bad for baby seals.
Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,
As bad as bad can be.
But splash and grow strong,
And you can't be wrong,
Child of the Open Sea



HE’S acruisin’ in a pearler with a dirty nigger crew,
Abuyin’ pearls and copra for a stingy Spanish Jew,
And his face is tann’d like leather ’neath a blazin’ tropic Sun,
And he’s workin’ out a penance for the things he hasn’t done. 
Round the Solomons he runs, tradin’ beads and castoff guns,
Buyin’ pearls from grinnin’ niggers, loadin copra by the ton;
And he’ll bargain and he’ll smile, but he’s thinkin’ all the while
Of the penance that he’s workin’ out for sins he hasn’t done. 

We’d been round the Horn together, and I’d come to know his worth;
The greatest friend I’d ever had, the whitest man on earth.
He’d pull’d me out of many a scrape, he’d risk’d his life for me,
And side by side, for many a year, we’d rough’d it on the sea; 

But a woman came between us; she was beautiful as Venus,
And she set her cap at him until she hook’d him unawares:
And I sailed off on my own
Leavin’ him and her alone:
Sign’d aboard a tramp for ’Frisco, leavin’ them in Bu’nos Ayres. 

When I met him in a twelvemonth he was goin’ to the deuce,
For she’s blacken’d all the good in him, she’d play’d him fast and loose,
And she’d gone off with a Dago who was lettin’ dollars fly,
And she’d left my mate to drink his precious soul away and die. 

Well, I talk’d and talk’d him over, and we sign’d aboard ‘The Rover.’
It was just like good old times, until we shor’d at Rio Bay;
Then the hand of Fate show’d plain brought us face to face again
With the woman, and the Dago who had taken her away. 

We were sittin’in a cafe when the couple came along,
She simply smil’d and pass’d us by, then vanish’d in the throng.
My mate jump’d up to follow, but I wouldn’t let him stir,
And later on a waiter brought a note that came from her:
She pretended she regretted
What she’d done, and that she fretted
For the wrong that she had done him, and she wanted to atone;
There was so much to explain,
Would he meet her once again
After midnight, in her garden she would watch for him, alone. 

’Course he went, but unbeknown to him I follow’d on behind.
I watch’d, and saw the shadows of two figures on the blind
The woman and the Dago and I heard the Dago shout,
They quarrell’d, and the woman scream’d and then a shot rang out.
My mate dash’d thro’ the curtain
And I follow’d, makin’certain
That my little gun was ready case I had to make a stand:
There I saw the Dago dead,
With a bullet thro’ his head,
And the woman standin’ near him with a shooter in her hand. 

Before the Civil Guard came in my mate had snatch’d her gun,
And he ask’d them to arrest him for the thing he hadn’t done.
I tried madly to explain things, but they shook their heads at me,
And the woman let them take him, so that she might get off free.
In the court I sat and heard her
Tell them all he’d done the murder,
And I pray’d she might be stricken into some shape,
He was sentenc’d for his life
But out there corruption’s rife,
And I brib’d and brib’d, until at last I manag’d his escape. 

Then I stow’d him on a hooker sailin’ far from woman’s wiles,
And he’s workin’ his salvation out amongst the South Sea Isles;
And the woman’s there at Rio, and she’s weavin’ of her spell,
With a crowd of fools awaitin’ her commands to burn in hell;
Whilst the whitest man I know
Buyin’pearls from dirty niggers ’neath a blazin tropic sun,
And he’ll cuss’em, and he’ll smile
But he’s thinkin’ all the while
Of the penance that he’s workin’out for things he hasn’t done. 


The waves are ne'er discordant
with the mighty ocean.
Even a small wave sent
is a part of the ocean
and when a giant wave looms large
even then ‘tis  a part of the ocean.

Through our lives misgivings barge
into the affairs of mundane tension.
But even as the waves roll
when the final bells toll
our exiguous life's soul 
mingles with the whole

I ran up six flights of stairs
to my small furnished room
opened the window
and began throwing out
those things most important in life


First to go, Truth, squealing like a fink:
'Don't! I'll tell awful things about you!'
'Oh yeah! Well, I've nothing to hide- OUT!'
'It's not my fault! I'm not the cause of it all!' 'OUT!'
Then Love, cooing bribes: 'You'll never know impotency!
All the girls on Vogue covers, all yours!'
I pushed her fat ass out and screamed:
'You always end up a bummer!'
I picked up Faith Hope Charity
all three clinging together:
'Without us you'll surely die!'
'With you I'm going nuts! Goodbye!'

The Beauty- ah, Beauty--
As I led her to the window
I told her: 'You I loved the best in life
-but you're a killer; Beauty kills!'
Not really meaning to drop her
I immediately ran downstairs
getting there just in time to catch her
'You saved me!' she cried
I put her down and told her: 'Move on.'

Went back up those six flights
went to the money
there was no money to throw out.
The only thing left in the room was Death
hiding beneath the kitchen sink:
'I'm not real!' It cried
'I'm just a rumor spread by life-'
Laughing I threw it out, kitchen sink and all
and suddenly realized Humor
was all that was left--
All I could do with Humor was to say:
'Out the window with the window!



'From her side of the bed
the wife suggests he get dressed, 
go out in the night and
purchase a piece. She's
 
not in the mood.  Or
if he must, he can
go ahead, stick it in, 
shoot it off, and get
 
the whole thing over with.
She doesn't care any more
where he pours it
so long as he's quiet
 
and doesn't wake the kids.
Too tired to dress, 
he sticks it in, explodes, 
rolls off, finally spent.
 
Maybe now the beasts
that will never creep
within his crosshairs
can get some sleep.

A shadow cast upon the wall, 
Candles flicker, wax drops fall, 
Silence is the only sound, 
companionship is slowly found, 
No photograph hang from a string, 
But silhouettes the flames do bring, 
Serenade to a lonely past
Is found behind dim lighting cast, 
Alone but with a single pen, 
To dwell on now and mostly then, 
Dreams are made before my eyes, 
As real to me as the open skies, 
Things I'd love to live one day, 
If only the visions don't fade away, 
I live too much in days gone by, 
The wick burns on, the flames just die, 
The shadows fade, near darkness now, 
Years have gone, I don't know how. 


Your goodness is vein, your love is pain
Living in a world where the wicked reign.
The rich is wicked but are favoured.
The poor is humble but are ridiculed.
Both needs a saviour.
In a wicked world what’s care and patience? 
Get rich or die trying I muse.
But the love of money is the evil thereof, 
If only they practice what they preach.
The wicked thoughts in their minds are detrimental.
Just listen to their speech, you’ll know.
Away from the alter their life’s a disaster, you’ll woe.
Wicked preachers and pastors, wicked teachers; actors.
But they’re the respected ones, 
The holy ones, the ones with the so called good names.
It’s a shame but we’ll elect them any day.
Wicked Prime Ministers, wicked Lawyers, wicked Judges, and wicked police.
When will they stop slay the innocents? 
When will they learn to obey their transcripts? 
Those with the pure heart are trapped under their manipulation.
Money means power so they have dominion.
Education they do have so their wiles are enormous.
They only pretend, they do not like us. 
Though we’ll always overcome their evil endeavours, 
On this earth the wicked reigns forever. 


Ocean, if you were to give, a measure, a ferment, a fruit
of your gifts and destructions, into my hand,
I would choose your far-off repose, your contour of steel,
your vigilant spaces of air and darkness,
and the power of your white tongue,
that shatters and overthrows columns,
breaking them down to your proper purity.



Not the final breaker, heavy with brine,
that thunders onshore, and creates
the silence of sand, that encircles the world,
but the inner spaces of force,
the naked power of the waters,
the immoveable solitude, brimming with lives.
It is Time perhaps, or the vessel filled
with all motion, pure Oneness,
that death cannot touch, the visceral green
of consuming totality.

Only a salt kiss remains of the drowned arm,
that lifts a spray: a humid scent,
of the damp flower, is left,
from the bodies of men. Your energies
form, in a trickle that is not spent,
form, in retreat into silence.

The falling wave,
arch of identity, shattering feathers,
is only spume when it clears, 
and returns to its source, unconsumed.

Your whole force heads for its origin.
The husks that your load threshes,
are only the crushed, plundered, deliveries,
that your act of abundance expelled,
all those that take life from your branches.

Your form extends beyond breakers,
vibrant, and rhythmic, like the chest, cloaking
a single being, and its breathings,
that lift into the content of light,
plains raised above waves,
forming the naked surface of earth.
You fill your true self with your substance.
You overflow curve with silence.


The vessel trembles with your salt and sweetness,
the universal cavern of waters,
and nothing is lost from you, as it is
from the desolate crater, or the bay of a hill,
those empty heights, signs, scars,
guarding the wounded air.

Your petals throbbing against the Earth,
trembling your submarine harvests,
your menace thickening the smooth swell,
with pulsations and swarming of schools,
and only the thread of the net raises
the dead lightning of fish-scale,
one wounded millimetre, in the space
of your crystal completeness. 


When she smiles her love draws nigh,
When she weeps he doth depart,
And returns to the Heavens high
With an unwounded heart.

As that he should see her tears
Lest his heart be sad among
His young joyous peers.

Therefore shall her tears be dried,
Therefore her poor lips will smile,
So her darling by her side
May sit down awhile.

So she bends her will to learn
Patience high and heavenly mirth,
That her soldier may return
To his own hearth. 


Cold was the night wind, drifting fast the snows fell,
Wide were the downs and shelterless and naked,
When a poor Wanderer struggled on her journey
       Weary and way-sore.

Drear were the downs, more dreary her reflexions;
Cold was the night wind, colder was her bosom!
She had no home, the world was all before her,
       She had no shelter.

Fast o'er the bleak heath rattling drove a chariot,
"Pity me!" feebly cried the poor night wanderer.
"Pity me Strangers! lest with cold and hunger
       Here I should perish.

"Once I had friends,--but they have all forsook me!
"Once I had parents,--they are now in Heaven!
"I had a home once--I had once a husband--
       "Pity me Strangers!

"I had a home once--I had once a husband--
"I am a Widow poor and broken-hearted!"
Loud blew the wind, unheard was her complaining.
       On drove the chariot.

On the cold snows she laid her down to rest her;
She heard a horseman, "pity me!" she groan'd out;
Loud blew the wind, unheard was her complaining,
       On went the horseman.

Worn out with anguish, toil and cold and hunger,
Down sunk the Wanderer, sleep had seiz'd her senses;
There, did the Traveller find her in the morning,

As she spins her web dew falls to the ground
Day breaks all around

Strings form a pattern of symmetry 
Hour glass tilted as time drips into memory

Darling weaves away
Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow she spins without a care

The bliss of her kiss winds into despair
Vibration sends a tingle everywhere
Poison, Passion, Bust qualities of Hate, Love, and Lust

The taste of blood seems warm enough to be
Not so surreal that it escapes reality 

Obsessive danger in a fling
Hell’s wrath of poison in a sting

Charmed by her reflection in the fallen rain
Eternity of love tortured pain

The seduction of an attractive dame
Feeling immortal and dying in a time all the same


Mrs. Ryan keeps her cat inside at night 
but lets it out at dawn to go anywhere it likes
while she's at work. Every day the cat 

crosses the road to call on the Widow Murphy.
Mrs. Ryan doesn't know her cat calls on Mrs. Murphy
but she has told the widow twice her cat is on a diet: 

a little kibble in the morning and a little water at night.
Nothing else. When the cat arrives at Mrs. Murphy's, 
the widow lets him in and gives him warm milk 

and a dollop of salmon on a porcelain saucer.
Afterward the cat takes a long nap on a Persian rug till
the widow lets him out in the afternoon

to cross the road and wait for Mrs. Ryan 
to pull her Lincoln into the driveway. 
Mrs. Ryan's husband, Paddy, now retired, 

has never called on the Widow Murphy.
He doesn't know the widow's waiting.
Paddy likes his tea strong, his wife once said. 


Every Saturday 
when the sun is out
and it's hotter than Hades

Monica next door 
raises her garage door
early in the morning 

and leaves it up 
long past noon as if 
Herm will walk out

at any minute 
oily and greasy
needing to clean up  

the way he used to 
every Saturday
for years until 

liquor ate his liver.
At night Monica
can still hear  

the tall Marine
fingering Taps 
over Herman's grave. 



As I wandered the forest,
The green leaves among,
I heard a Wild Flower
Singing a song.

'I slept in the earth
In the silent night,
I murmured my fears
And I felt delight.

'In the morning I went
As rosy as morn,
To seek for new joy; 
But oh! met with scorn.

'The wild gazelle on Judah's hills, 
Exulting yet may bound, 
And drink from all the living rills 
That gush on holy ground: 
Its airy step and glorious eye 
May glance in tameless transport by.: - 


A step as fleet, an eye more bright, 
Hath Judah witness'd there; 
And o'er her scenes of lost delight 
Inhabitants more fair, 
The cedars wave on Lebanon, 
But Judah's statelier maids are gone! 

More blest each palm that shades those plains 
Than Israel's scatter'd race: 
For, taking root, it there remains 
In solitary grace: 
It cannot quit the place of birth, 
It will not live in other earth. 

But we must wander witheringly, 
In other lands to die; 
And where our fathers' ashes be, 
Our own may never lie: 
Our temple hath not left a stone. 
And Mockery sits on Salem's throne. 



Wild geese fly overhead
In the wild Autumn weather.
Souls of the newly-dead
Crying and flying together.

Home from the last great fight,
The souls of the Irish farin'
With a wild heart in the night,
A grey eye turned to Erin.

High and high in the sky,
From the red fields of slaughter
Ever they fly and cry
For the brown bog, the grey water.

Wild geese in the wild even,
Steady and strong their flight,
Their beds are made in Heaven,
All of the down white.

They have forgone that bliss
Till they have seen once more
The little land of peace,
Green and bright as of yore.

High o'er the sheep and cattle,
The bogs and the mountains lone,
The souls new-home from the battle
Cry their love and are flown. 


I came too late to the hills: they were swept bare
Winters before I was born of song and story,
Of spell or speech with power of oracle or invocation,

The great ash long dead by a roofless house, its branches rotten,
The voice of the crows an inarticulate cry,
And from the wells and springs the holy water ebbed away.

A child I ran in the wind on a withered moor
Crying out after those great presences who were not there,
Long lost in the forgetfulness of the forgotten.

Only the archaic forms themselves could tell!
In sacred speech of hoodie on gray stone, or hawk in air,
Of Eden where the lonely rowan bends over the dark pool.

Yet I have glimpsed the bright mountain behind the mountain,
Knowledge under the leaves, tasted the bitter berries red,
Drunk water cold and clear from an inexhaustible hidden fountain. 



Before I sigh my last gasp, let me breathe, 
Great Love, some legacies ; I here bequeath 
Mine eyes to Argus, if mine eyes can see ; 
If they be blind, then, Love, I give them thee ;
My tongue to Fame ; to ambassadors mine ears ;
To women, or the sea, my tears ;
Thou, Love, hast taught me heretofore
By making me serve her who had twenty more,
That I should give to none, but such as had too much before.

My constancy I to the planets give ;
My truth to them who at the court do live ;
My ingenuity and openness,
To Jesuits ; to buffoons my pensiveness ;
My silence to any, who abroad hath been ;
My money to a Capuchin :
Thou, Love, taught'st me, by appointing me
To love there, where no love received can be,
Only to give to such as have an incapacity.

My faith I give to Roman Catholics ;
All my good works unto the Schismatics
Of Amsterdam ; my best civility
And courtship to an University ;
My modesty I give to soldiers bare ;
My patience let gamesters share :
Thou, Love, taught'st me, by making me
Love her that holds my love disparity,
Only to give to those that count my gifts indignity.

I give my reputation to those
Which were my friends ; mine industry to foes ;
To schoolmen I bequeath my doubtfulness ;
My sickness to physicians, or excess ;
To nature all that I in rhyme have writ ; 
And to my company my wit :
Thou, Love, by making me adore
Her, who begot this love in me before,
Taught'st me to make, as though I gave, when I do but restore.

To him for whom the passing-bell next tolls,
I give my physic books ; my written rolls
Of moral counsels I to Bedlam give ;
My brazen medals unto them which live
In want of bread ; to them which pass among
All foreigners, mine English tongue :
Though, Love, by making me love one
Who thinks her friendship a fit portion
For younger lovers, dost my gifts thus disproportion.

Therefore I'll give no more, but I'll undo
The world by dying, because love dies too.
Then all your beauties will be no more worth
Than gold in mines, where none doth draw it forth ;
And all your graces no more use shall have,
Than a sun-dial in a grave :
Thou, Love, taught'st me by making me
Love her who doth neglect both me and thee,
To invent, and practise this one way, to annihilate all three. 




You can beat me with all your weapons, but                                You can not beat my will,                                               You can kill me with all that you have, but                                         You can not break my will,                                               You can lock me up for ever and ever, but                                You can not bend my will,                                                      You can freeze me in your ruthless freezer, but                           You can not own my will,                                                     You can do what you like with your might, but                                You can not control my will,                                                You can take me and tie me for ever, but                                  You can not buy my will, and                                               You can do whatever you like to torture me, but                             You can not move my will,                                                 My will is strong and hard. 

Amyntas led me to a Grove,
Where all the Trees did shade us;
The Sun it self, though it had Strove,
It could not have betray'd us:
The place secur'd from humane Eyes,
No other fear allows,
But when the Winds that gently rise,
Doe Kiss the yielding Boughs.

Down there we satt upon the Moss,
And did begin to play
A Thousand Amorous Tricks, to pass
The heat of all the day.
A many Kisses he did give:
And I return'd the same
Which made me willing to receive
That which I dare not name.
His Charming Eyes no Aid requir'd
To tell their softning Tale;
On her that was already fir'd,
'Twas Easy to prevaile.
He did but Kiss and Clasp me round,
Whilst those his thoughts Exprest:
And lay'd me gently on the Ground:
Ah who can guess the rest

Who has seen the wind? 
Not me, not you, not them
can see the wind even
those with eyes as big as balls.
The wind passes by without
traffic control and sets her pace
to directions, without our invitation.
The wind touches our skin with
her soft fingers or rages like
fire that eats up the standing embers.


Why do I have one tongue? 
Why do I have one face? 
Why do I have one name? 
Why do I have one place? 
I want to be like the wind.
Pluck my words out of the air
Coming from no place
And following no trace
Crossing the oceans 
Blowing away my bleeding letters 
To every beast and every angel
Mixing the sands of the desert
And the screams of my ancestors
Whispering the voice of Tihya in every ear
Being proud, being with no border
An invisible face with several names
Like north-easterly or south-westerly winds
I keep cursing some faces and blessing others
Brining moisture from the seas
To hard hearts of the south
I want to be like the wind.
Why do I have one tongue? 
Why do I have one face? 
Why do I have one name? 
Why do I have one place


He shouts in the sails of the ships at sea, 
He steals the down from the honeybee, 
He makes the forest trees rustle and sing, 
He twirls my kite till it breaks its string. 
Laughing, dancing, sunny wind, 
Whistling, howling, rainy wind, 
North, South, East and West, 
Each is the wind I like the best. 
He calls up the fog and hides the hills, 
He whirls the wings of the great windmills, 
The weathercocks love him and turn to discover 
His whereabouts -- but he's gone, the rover! 
Laughing, dancing, sunny wind, 
Whistling, howling, rainy wind, 
North, South, East and West, 
Each is the wind I like the best. 

The pine trees toss him their cones with glee, 
The flowers bend low in courtesy, 
Each wave flings up a shower of pearls, 
The flag in front of the school unfurls. 
Laughing, dancing, sunny wind, 
Whistling, howling, rainy wind, 
North, South, East and West, 
Each is the wind I like the best.



A wind is blowing over my soul, 
I hear it cry the whole night thro' -- 
Is there no peace for me on earth 
Except with you?

Alas, the wind has made me wise, 
Over my naked soul it blew, -- 
There is no peace for me on earth 
Even with you. 

I saw you toss the kites on high 
And blow the birds about the sky; 
And all around I heard you pass, 
Like ladies' skirts across the grass-- 
O wind, a-blowing all day long, 
O wind, that sings so loud a song! 

I saw the different things you did, 
But always you yourself you hid. 
I felt you push, I heard you call, 
I could not see yourself at all-- 
O wind, a-blowing all day long, 
O wind, that sings so loud a song! 

O you that are so strong and cold, 
O blower, are you young or old? 
Are you a beast of field and tree, 
Or just a stronger child than me? 
O wind, a-blowing all day long, 
O wind, that sings so loud a song![. ]


Out of him
The country -in desperation- was howling at the moon
It was howling in the shadow of a buzzard's wing
A boneless wing, hanging by a cloud of rags.

Out of him
Rubble of villages and crumbled people
- Crumbled and windy
- Rubble of grief and anger

He went straight on, like the northern wind
Howling along with the country, trampling on
Billions of unfulfilled promises and immense carnages.

He went straight on, barely dodging
The cracks in the Palace and the biological wells
And the altars of ballots - shored and secluded.

His eyes dug through skeletons of houses and
[
People. He dug where others, before, had dug: 
By his bloody fingers -  bloody tendons of frayed hope.

He dug where others had reached feeble, shriveled breaths.
He dug and dug..



He dug..
Yet, he got nothing but his void glance
Nothing but the breath of his glance

Out of him
The country, desperate, kept howling at the moon.

[. ]the wind 

awakens you tonight 
you say you hear your mother 
kissing the children



THE wind blew shrill and smart,
And the wind awoke my heart
Again to go a-sailing o'er the sea,
To hear the cordage moan
And the straining timbers groan,
And to see the flying pennon lie a-lee.

O sailor of the fleet,
It is time to stir the feet!
It's time to man the dingy and to row!
It's lay your hand in mine
And it's empty down the wine,
And it's drain a health to death before we go!

To death, my lads, we sail;
And it's death that blows the gale
And death that holds the tiller as we ride.
For he's the king of all
In the tempest and the squall,
And the ruler of the Ocean wild and wide

STEELY stars and moon of brass,
How mockingly you watch me pass!
You know as well as I how soon
I shall be blind to stars and moon,
Deaf to the wind in the hemlock tree,
Dumb when the brown earth weighs on me.
With envious dark rage I bear,
Stars, your cold complacent stare;
Heart-broken in my hate look up,
Moon, at your clear immortal cup,
Changing to gold from dusky red—
Age after age when I am dead
To be filled up with light, and then
Emptied, to be refilled again.
What has man done that only he
Is slave to death—so brutally
Beaten back into the earth
Impatient for him since his birth?
Oh let me shut my eyes, close out
The sight of stars and earth and be
Sheltered a minute by this tree.
Hemlock, through your fragrant boughs
There moves no anger and no doubt,
No envy of immortal things.
The night-wind murmurs of the sea
With veiled music ceaselessly,
That to my shaken spirit sings.
From their frail nest the robins rouse,
In your pungent darkness stirred,
Twittering a low drowsy word—
And me you shelter, even me.
In your quietness you house
The wind, the woman and the bird.
You speak to me and I have heard:

THE wind is without there and howls in the trees,
And the rain-flurries drum on the glass:
Alone by the fireside with elbows on knees
I can number the hours as they pass.
Yet now, when to cheer me the crickets begin,
And my pipe is just happily lit,
Believe me, my friend, tho' the evening draws in,
That not all uncontested I sit.


Alone, did I say?  O no, nowise alone
With the Past sitting warm on my knee,
To gossip of days that are over and gone,
But still charming to her and to me.
With much to be glad of and much to deplore,
Yet, as these days with those we compare,
Believe me, my friend, tho' the sorrows seem more
They are somehow more easy to bear.


And thou, faded Future, uncertain and frail,
As I cherish thy light in each draught,
His lamp is not more to the miner - their sail
Is not more to the crew on the raft.
For Hope can make feeble ones earnest and brave,
And, as forth thro' the years I look on,
Believe me, my friend, between this and the grave,
I see wonderful things to be done.

To do or to try; and, believe me, my friend,
If the call should come early for me,
I can leave these foundations uprooted, and tend
For some new city over the sea.
To do or to try; and if failure be mine,
And if Fortune go cross to my plan,
Believe me, my friend, tho' I mourn the design
I shall never lament for the man. 


The wind of death, that softly blows 
The last warm petal from the rose, 
The last dry leaf from off the tree, 
To-night has come to breathe on me. 
There was a time I learned to hate
As weaker mortals learn to love; 
The passion held me fixed as fate, 
Burned in my veins early and late;
But now a wind falls from above– 
The wind of death, that silently 
Enshroudeth friend and enemy. 
There was a time my soul was thrilled
By keen ambition's whip and spur; 
My master forced me where he willed, 
And with his power my life was filled;
But now the old-time pulses stir 
How faintly in the wind of death, 
That bloweth lightly as a breath. 
And once, but once, at Love's dear feet
I yielded strength and life and heart; 
His look turned bitter into sweet, 
His smile made all the world complete;
The wind blows loves like leaves apart– 
The wind of death, that tenderly 
Is blowing 'twixt my love and me. 
O wind of death, that darkly blows 
Each separate ship of human woes 
Far out on a mysterious sea, 
I turn, I turn my face to thee


oh  wind where do you go
before the dawn
 
oh  wind where do you go
before the dawn
to return a newly born
 
oh wind where do you bathe
before the dawn
oh wind what is this odourless perfume
you wear every morn
 
oh wind where is your dressing room
is  it near or far. . 

your dressing room


This summer day is all one palace rare,
Builded by architects of life unseen,
In elfin hours the sun and moon between,
Up out of quarries of the sea and air,
And earth's fine essences. Aladdin's were
But tinsel sheen beside this gloried dream,
High, sunny-windowed, walled by wood and stream,
And high, dome-roofed, blue-burnished, beyond compare.
Here reigns a king, the happiest known on earth,
That blithesome monarch mortals call the wind,
Who roves his galleries wide in vagrant mirth,
His courtier clouds obedient to his mind;
Or when he sleeps his sentinal stars are still,
With ethiop guards o'ertopping some grave hill. 



There's music in my heart all day,
I hear it late and early,
It comes from fields are far away,
The wind that shakes the barley.

Above the uplands drenched with dew
The sky hangs soft and pearly,
An emerald world is listening to
The wind that shakes the barley.

Above the bluest mountain crest
The lark is singing rarely,
It rocks the singer into rest,
The wind that shakes the barley.

Oh, still through summers and through springs
It calls me late and early.
Come home, come home, come home, it sings,
The wind that shakes the barley. 

The wind blows, 
but it does not show.
It's an everlasting that seems to fly, 
but it never is seen by the eye.

The Wind Unseen

We can chase it as long as you please, 
but catching it won't be of any ease.
You can't train it to do what you want.
It's something that can and will haunt.

The Wind Unseen


The wind gushes beneath
And wheezes above, disappeared
Up the the azure sky; 
Where clouds paint a mural
Of white and grey and black colours.

Though not seen by the eyes curious of man; 
The wind power shows
In the clouds, 
They stretch and spread like
Sisal sponges 
And heaps that lie like
The hare's mounds planted slyly
With his wits.
The sky rumbled a crumbling sound
And the wind's power holding forth
The elders look up
And look down on the divination shells
No, it will not rain
Buttressed by the trellised 
Flashes of thunder; 
The line and sea quals quarrel
And the north easterlies prevails southerly
And the dry season is here. 

In my little night, alas
The storm has a fateful tryst 
with the sweet sleep of  the trees.
 
In my little night, alas
The freezing fright of ruin streams.
 
Listen!
The shadows are stepping by-
We must flee.
 
This bliss seems so odd to me,
I am addicted to my despair,
I feel that something will disrupt
this flowing peace of our quiet night.
 
 
Listen!
The shadows are stepping by-
We must flee.
 
Don’t you see?
Our roof is shaking in fear of collapse,
and over this roof,  an immense dark cloud,
like a dull, grieving crowd,
is expecting the moment of cry.
 
Don’t you hear?
Night is marching behind the window’s glass
and the wind is cutting our yard’s breath
It seems that  stranger eyes
are watching this house.
 
Listen!
The shadows are stepping by-
We must flee.
 
 
You,
O green like the soul of the leaves,
Put your hands into mine,
And hold them like the burning memories of love.
 
You,
O green like the soul of the leaves,
Leave your lips to the stroke of mine,
And savor them like the swell flavor of an old wine.
 
If we forget,
The wind will take us away,
The wind will take us away.
 
 



Go easy wit' de paddle, an' steady wit' de
oar
Geev rudder to de bes' man you got among
de crew,
Let ev'ry wan be quiet, don't let dem sing no
more
W'en you see de islan' risin' out of Grande
Lac Manitou
Above us on de sky dere, de summer cloud
may float 
Aroun' us on de water de ripple never show,
But somet'ing down below us can rock de
stronges' boat,
W'en we 're comin' near de islan' of de
spirit Windigo!

De carcajou may breed dere, an' otter sweem
de poole
De moosh-rat mak' de mud house, an' beaver
buil' hees dam
An' beeges' Injun hunter on all de Tête de 
Boule
Will never set hees trap dere from spring
to summer tam.

But he 'll bring de fines' presen' from upper
St. Maurice
De loup marin an' black-fox from off de
Hodson Bay
An' hide dem on de islan' an' smoke de pipe
of peace
So Windigo will help heem w'en he travel
far away.

We shaintee on dat islan' on de winter seexty-
nine
If you look you see de clearin' aroun' de
Coo Coo Cache,
An' pleasan' place enough too among de spruce
an' pine
If foreman on de shaintee is n't Cyprien
Palache.

Beeg feller, alway watchin' on hees leetle
weasel eye,
De gang dey can't do not'ing but he see dem
purty quick
Wit' hees 'Hi dere, w'at you doin' ?' ev'ry
tam he 's passin' by
An' de bad word he was usin' , wall! it offen
mak' me sick.

An' he carry silver w'issle wit' de chain aroun' 
hees neck
For fear he mebbe los' it, an' ev'ry body say
He mus' buy it from de devil w'en he 's 
passin' on Kebeck
But if it 's true dat story, I dunno how
moche he pay.

Dere 's plaintee on de shaintee can sing lak
rossignol
Pet Clancy play de fiddle, an' Jimmie Char-
bonneau
Was bring hees concertina from below St.
Fereol
So we get some leetle pleasure till de long,
long winter go. 

But if we start up singin' affer supper on de 
camp
'Par derriere chez ma tante,' or 'Mattawa
wishtay,'
De boss he 'll come along den, an' put heem
out de lamp,
An' only stop hees swearin' w'en we all go
marche coucher.

We 've leetle boy dat winter from Po-po-lo-be-
lang
Hees fader an' hees moder dey're bote
A-ben-a-kee
An' he 's comin' , Injun Johnnie, wit' some
man de lumber gang
Was fin' heem nearly starvin' above on Lac
Souris.

De ole man an' de woman is tryin' pass de Soo
W'en water 's high on spring tam, an' of
course dey 're gettin' drown',
For even smartes' Injun should n't fool wit' 
birch canoe,
W'ere de reever lak toboggan on de hill is
runnin' down.

So dey lef' de leetle feller all alone away up
dere
Till lumber gang is ketchin' him an' bring
him on de Cache,
But better if he 's stayin' wit' de wolf an' wit'
de bear
Dan come an' tak' hees chances wit' Cyprien
Palache.

I wonder how he stan' it, w'y he never run
away
For Cyprien lak neeger he is treat heem all
de sam'
An' if he 's wantin' Johnnie on de night or on
de day
de secon'tam!

De boy he don 't say not'ing, no wan never see
heem cry
He 's got de Injun in heem, you can see it 
on de face,
An' only for us feller an' de cook, he 'll surely
die
Long before de winter 's over, long before
we lef' de place,

But I see heem hidin' somet'ing wan morning
by de shore
So firse tam I was passin' I scrape away de 
snow
An' it 's rabbit skin he 's ketchin' on de swamp
de day before,
Leetle Injun Johnnie 's workin' on de spirit
Windigo.

December's come in stormy, an' de snow-dreef
fill de road
Can only see de chimley an' roof of our
cabane,
An' stronges' team on stable fin' it plaintee
heavy load
Haulin' sleigh an' two t'ree pine log t'roo
de wood an' beeg savane.

An' I travel off wan day me, wit' Cyprien
Palache
Explorin' for new timber, w'en de win' be-
gin to blow,
So we hurry on de snow-shoe for de camp on
Coo Coo Cache
If de nor' eas' storm is comin', was de bes' 
place we dunno-

An' we 're gettin' safe enough dere wit' de
storm close on our heel,
But w'en our belt we loosen for takin' off de
coat
De foreman commence screamin' an' mon Dieu
it mak' us feel
Lak he got t'ree t'ousan' devil all fightin' on
hees t'roat.

Cyprien is los' hees w'issle, Cyprien is los' hees
chain
Injun Johnnie he mus' fin' it, even if de win'
is high

He can never show hese'f on de Coo Coo
Cache again
Till he bring dat silver w'issle an' de chain
it 's hangin' by.

So he sen' heem on hees journey never knowin' 
he come back
T'roo de rough an' stormy wedder, t'roo de
pile of dreefin' snow
'Wat 's de use of bein' Injun if you can 't
smell out de track?'
Dat 's de way de boss is talkin' , an' poor
Johnnie have to go.

If you want to hear de musique of de nort' win'
as it blow
An' lissen to the hurricane an' learn de way
it sing
An' feel how small de man is w'en he 's
leevin' here below,
You should try it on de shaintee w'en she 's
doin' all dem t'ing!

W'at 's dat soun' lak somet'ing cryin' all
aroun' us ev'ryw'ere?
We never hear no tonder upon de winter
storm!
Dey 're shoutin' to each oder dem voices on
de air,
An' it 's red hot too de stove pipe, but no
wan 's feelin' warm!

'Get out an' go de woodpile before I freeze
to deat''
Cyprien de boss is yellin' an' he 's lookin'
cole an' w'ite
Lak dead man on de coffin, but no wan go,
you bet,
For if it 's near de woodpile, 't is n't close
enough to-night!

Non! we ain't afraid of not'ing, but we don 't
lak takin' chance,
An' w'en we hear de spirit of de wil' A-ben-
a-kee
Singin' war song on de chimley, makin' all dem
Injun dance
Raisin' row dere, you don't ketch us on no
woodpile -no siree!

O! de lonesome night we 're passin' w'ile
we 're stayin' on dat place!
An' ev'rybody sheever when Jimmie Char
bonneau
Say he 's watchin' on de winder an' he see de
Injun face
An' it 's lookin' so he tole us, jus' de sam'
as Windingo.

Den again mese'f I 'm hearin' somet'ing
callin', an' it soun'
Lak de voice of leetle Johnnie so I'm
passin' on de door

But de pine stump on de clearin' wit' de w'ite
sheet all aroun' 
Mak' me t'ink of churchyar' tombstone, an' 
I can't go dere no more.

Wat's de reason we 're so quiet w'ile our
heart she 's goin' fas'
W'y is no wan ax de question? dat we're
all afraid to spik?
Was it wing of flyin' wil' bird strek de winder
as it pass,
Or de sweesh of leetle snow-ball w'en de win'
is playin' trick?

W'en we buil' de Coo Coo shaintee, she's as
steady as a rock,
Did you feel de shaintee shakin' de sam,
she's goin' to fall?
Dere's somet'ing on de doorway! an' now we 
hear de knock
An' up above de hurricane we hear de w'issle
call.

Callin', callin' lak a bugle, an' he's jompin' up
de boss
From hees warm bed on de corner an' open
wide de door-
Dere's no use foller affer for Cyprien is los'
An' de Coo Coo Cache an' shaintee he'll
never see no more.

At las' de morning's comin', an' storm is blow
away
An' outside on de shaintee young Jimmie
Charbonneau
He's seein' track of snowshoe, 'bout de size of
doulbe sleigh
Dere's no mistak' it's makin' by de spirit
Windigo.

An' de leetle Injuin Johnie, he's all right I
onderstan'
For you'll fin' heem up de reever above de 
Coo Coo Cache
Ketchin' mink and ketchin' beaver, an' he's
growin' great beeg man
But dat's de las' we're hearin' of Cyprien
Palache. 


On the winding road of life, often
splattered with showers I found myself
Caught in the fury of a storm, or lashed
by the winds of change
The trees were no shelter
Drowned as they were, in tears
Dripping on to me all their sorrows
So I left, to walk on slippery road
Hoping to slide on, all by myself
Clutching the hand of Fate, as my sole comfort
I saw, trudging along, dreams turning into dust
Love collapsing like a sandcastle
Promises broken like crystals
Be it rain or sunshine on the winding road
The trees soaked in a torrent of crying
Or leaves shining with the birth of sunshine
The winding road has no end
For solitary, echoless footsteps. 

All night long, by a distant bell,
The passing hours were notched
On the dark, while her breathing rose and fell,
And the spark of life I watched
In her face was glowing or fading, -- who could tell? --
And the open window of the room,
With a flare of yellow light,
Was peering out into the gloom,
Like an eye that searched the night. 

Oh, what do you see in the dark, little window, and why do you fear?
"I see that the garden is crowded with creeping forms of fear:
Little white ghosts in the locust-tree, that wave in the night-wind's breath,
And low in the leafy laurels the larking shadow of death
 


Sweet, clear notes of a waking bird
Told of the passing away
Of the dark, -- and my darling may have heard;
For she smiled in her sleep, while the ray
Of the rising dawn spoke joy without a word,
Till the splendor born in the east outburned 
The yellow lamplight, pale and thin,
And the open window slowly turned
To the eye of the morning, looking in. 

Oh, what do you see in the room, little window, that makes you so bright?
"I see that a child is asleep on her pillow, soft and white,
With the rose of life on her tips, and the breath of life in her breast, 

"In the sweet, Atlantic
Breathing of spring
My curtain's like a butterfly,
Huge, fluttering
Like a Hindu widow
To a pyre's golden blaze,
Like a drowsy Naiad
To past-window seas. 


THE WINDOW

The Window is where stood 
while the rain poured out like tears, 
at one time the sky was beautiful 
like the ocean blue, 
 
But that was some time ago 
way before my life became cold, 
what a wonderful thing the beauty 
of the light was to my eyes, 

But with time everything lost its beauty
I have learned just to look out my window
just to feel safe, 
life isn't what it used to be.




but the window is boarded, completely nailed shut.
And suddenly falling, the rope has been cut.
It can't stop the descent all on it's own, 
It has no more life left to give, all alone.  

He is a brittle crazie glasse:
Yet in thy temple thou dost him afford
This glorious and transcendent place,
To be a window, through thy grace.

But when thou dost anneal in glasse thy storie,
Making thy life to shine within
The holy Preachers ; then the light and glorie
More rev'rend grows, & more doth win:
Which else shows watrish, bleak, & thin.

Doctrine and life, colours and light, in one
When they combine and mingle, bring
A strong regard and aw : but speech alone
Doth vanish like a flaring thing,
And in the eare, not conscience ring. 



I.

Ye winds, ye unseen currents of the air,
Softly ye played a few brief hours ago;
Ye bore the murmuring bee; ye tossed the hair
O'er maiden cheeks, that took a fresher glow;
Ye rolled the round white cloud through depths of blue;
Ye shook from shaded flowers the lingering dew;
Before you the catalpa's blossoms flew,
Light blossoms, dropping on the grass like snow.


II.

How are ye changed! Ye take the cataract's sound;
Ye take the whirlpool's fury and its might;
The mountain shudders as ye sweep the ground;
The valley woods lie prone beneath your flight.
The clouds before you shoot like eagles past;
The homes of men are rocking in your blast;
Ye lift the roofs like autumn leaves, and cast,
Skyward, the whirling fragments out of sight.


III.

The weary fowls of heaven make wing in vain,
To escape your wrath; ye seize and dash them dead.
Against the earth ye drive the roaring rain;
The harvest-field becomes a river's bed;
And torrents tumble from the hills around,
Plains turn to lakes, and villages are drowned,
And wailing voices, midst the tempest's sound,
Rise, as the rushing waters swell and spread.


IV.

Ye dart upon the deep, and straight is heard
A wilder roar, and men grow pale, and pray;
Ye fling its floods around you, as a bird
Flings o'er his shivering plumes the fountain's spray.
See! to the breaking mast the sailor clings;
Ye scoop the ocean to its briny springs,
And take the mountain billow on your wings,
And pile the wreck of navies round the bay.


V.

Why rage ye thus?--no strife for liberty
Has made you mad; no tyrant, strong through fear,
Has chained your pinions till ye wrenched them free,
And rushed into the unmeasured atmosphere;
For ye were born in freedom where ye blow;
Free o'er the mighty deep to come and go;
Earth's solemn woods were yours, her wastes of snow,
Her isles where summer blossoms all the year.


VI.

O ye wild winds! a mightier Power than yours
In chains upon the shore of Europe lies;
The sceptred throng, whose fetters he endures,
Watch his mute throes with terror in their eyes:
And armed warriors all around him stand,
And, as he struggles, tighten every band,
And lift the heavy spear, with threatening hand,
To pierce the victim, should he strive to rise.


VII.

Yet oh, when that wronged Spirit of our race
Shall break, as soon he must, his long-worn chains,
And leap in freedom from his prison-place,
Let him not rise, like these mad winds of air,
To waste the loveliness that time could spare,
To fill the earth with wo, and blot her fair
Unconscious breast with blood from human veins.


VIII.

But may he like the spring-time come abroad,
Who crumbles winter's gyves with gentle might,
Come spouting up the unsealed springs to light;
Flowers start from their dark prisons at his feet,
The woods, long dumb, awake to hymnings sweet,
And morn and eve, whose glimmerings almost meet,
Crowd back to narrow bounds the ancient night. 

When dark November bade the leaves adieu,
And the gale sung amid the sea-boy's shrouds,
Methought I saw four winged forms, that flew,
With garments streaming light, amid the clouds;
From adverse regions of the sky,
In dim succession, they went by.
The first, as o'er the billowy deep he passed,
Blew from its brazen trump a far-resounding blast.
Upon a beaked promontory high,
With streaming heart, and cloudy brow severe, 
Marked ye the father of the frowning year!
Dark vapours rolled o'er the tempestuous sky,
When creeping WINTER from his cave came forth;
Stern courier of the storm, he cried, what from the north?



NORTH WIND.

From the vast and desert deeps,
Where the lonely Kraken sleeps,
Where fixed the icy mountains high
Glimmer to the twilight sky;
Where, six lingering months to last, 
The night has closed, the day is past,
Father, lo, I come, I come:
I have heard the wizard's drum,
And the withered Lapland hag,
Seal, with muttered spell, her bag:
O'er mountains white, and forests sere,
I flew, and with a wink am here.

WINTER.

Spirit of unwearied wing,
From the Baltic's frozen main,
From the Russ's bleak domain, 
Say, what tidings dost thou bring!
Shouts, and the noise of battle! and again
The winged wind blew loud a deadly blast;
Shouts, and the noise of battle! the long main
Seemed with hoarse voice to answer as he passed.
The moody South went by, and silence kept;
The cloudy rack oft hid his mournful mien,
And frequent fell the showers, as if he wept
The eternal havoc of this mortal scene.
He had heard the yell, and cry, 
And howling dance of Anarchy,
Where the Rhone, with rushing flood,
Murmured to the main, through blood:--
He seemed to wish he could for ever throw
His misty mantle o'er a world of woe.
But rousing him from his desponding trance,
Cold Eurus blew his sharp and shrilling horn;
In his right hand he bore an icy lance,
That far off glittered in the frost of morn;
The old man knew the clarion from afar, 
What from the East? he cried.

EAST WIND.

Shouts, and the noise of war!
Far o'er the land hath been my flight,
O'er many a forest dark as night,
O'er champaigns where the Tartar speeds,
O'er Wolga's wild and giant reeds,
O'er the Carpathian summits hoar,
Beneath whose snows and shadows frore,
Poland's level length unfolds
Her trackless woods and wildering wolds, 
Like a spirit, seeking rest,
I have passed from east to west,
While sounds of discord and lament
Rose from the earth where'er I went.
I care not; hurrying, as in scorn,
I shook my lance, and blew my horn;
The day shows clear; and merrily
Along the Atlantic now I fly.
Who comes in soft and spicy vest,
From the mild regions of the West? 
An azure veil bends waving o'er his head,
And showers of violets from his hands are shed.
'Tis Zephyr, with a look as young and fair
As when his lucid wings conveyed
That beautiful and gentle maid
Psyche, transported through the air,
The blissful couch of Love's own god to share.
Winter, avaunt! thy haggard eye
Will scare him, as he wanders by,
Him and the timid butterfly. 
He brings again the morn of May;
The lark, amid the clear blue sky,
Carols, but is not seen so high,
And all the winter's winds fly far away!
I cried: O Father of the world, whose might
The storm, the darkness, and the winds obey,
Oh, when will thus the long tempestuous night
Of warfare and of woe be rolled away!
Oh, when will cease the uproar and the din,
And Peace breathe soft, Summer is coming in

One ship drives east and another drives west
With the selfsame winds that blow.
Tis the set of the sails
And not the gales
Which tells us the way to go. 
Like the winds of the seas are the ways of fate,
As we voyage along through the life:
Tis the set of a soul
That decides its goal,
And not the calm or the strife. 

I CANNOT die, who drank delight
From the cup of the crescent moon,
And hungrily as men eat bread,
Loved the scented nights of June.
The rest may die—but is there not
Some shining strange escape for me
Who sought in Beauty the bright wine
Of immortality


I asked the moon to drink with me tonight; 
he just gave me a heavy sigh, 
as though he heard that plea from me
a thousand times before.
Morning after morning, I don't see the sun; 
that was after the day you were gone.
I filled my cup with wine, 
the sounds of it seems music to my ears.
I wish to fade as you fade
with the passing years.
Every gulp of it brings the memory
when you were here by my side.
'You'll be back' - a sentimental lie.
My cup was empty and i filled it again.
Only now, the tears flowed like rain.
'You did want me' - another lie.
And i drink with my shadow
as the time passes by.
I was slowly consumed, like fire down a candle; 
like drops of water flowing like a passing river.
The taste of wine on my lips
seems so sweet.  

I drank again.
'You miss me'- a sweeter lie.
I drank till the dawn is nigh.
I ask only to be drunk forever
and never wake. 
to lie forgotten with the darkness; 
to sleep forgotten in the depths of a lake.
'You did love me' - the sweetest lie.
I wish to fade as the years pass by.
But tonight, there's just this wine and me
forgotten with the wind.
With our endless torments, 
with our bitter tears. 
There's just this wine and me to let me forget you
and the sorrows of a thousand years. 

WITHIN Fancy's halls I sit and quaff
Rich draughts of the wine of Song,
And I drink and drink
To the very brink
Of delirium wild and strong,
Till I lose all sense of the outer world
And see not the human throng.

The lyral chords of each rising thought
Are swept by a hand unseen,
And I glide and glide
With my music bride,
Where few spiritless souls have been;
And I soar afar on wings of sound

Deep, deeper still, from the springs of Thought
I quaff till the fount is dry,
And I climb and climb
To a height sublime
Up the stars of some lyric sky,
Where I seem to rise upon airs that melt
Into song as they pass by.

Millennial rounds of bliss I live,
Withdrawn from my cumbrous clay,
As I sweep and sweep
Through infinite deep
On deep of that starry spray;
Myself a sound on its world-wide round,
A tone on its spheral way.

And wheresoe'er through the wondrous space
My soul wings its noiseless flight,

On their astral rounds
Float divinest sounds,
Unseen, save by spirit-sight,
Obeying some wise, eternal law,
As fixed as the law of light.

But, oh, when my cup of dainty bliss
Is drained of the wine of Song,
How I fall and fall
At the sober call
Of the body that waiteth long
To hurry me back to its cares terrene,
And earth's spiritless human throng

Man thinks that he has time
In his pocket  to spend like his money
Time jumps out and sits on his laps 
And he thinks that he has had a baby
He plays, hugs and cuddles  his child
Putting off what 
He could do at that time
Time lay bare its tricks
Grow wings
And away it fleeeeeeeeew




I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long

I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you
Every time


I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down

How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose

Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you
Every time-




What the moral? Who rides may read.
When the night is thick and the tracks are blind
A friend at a pinch is a friend, indeed,
But a fool to wait for the laggard behind.
Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,
He travels the fastest who travels alone.

White hands cling to the tightened rein,
Slipping the spur from the booted heel,
Tenderest voices cry " Turn again!"
Red lips tarnish the scabbarded steel,
High hopes faint on a warm hearth-stone--
He travels the fastest who travels alone.

One may fall but he falls by himself--
Falls by himself with himself to blame.
One may attain and to him is pelf--
Loot of the city in Gold or Fame.
Plunder of earth shall be all his own
Who travels the fastest and travels alone.


Wherefore the more ye be helpen-. 

en and stayed,
Stayed by a friend in the hour of toil,
Sing the heretical song I have made--
His be the labour and yours be the spoil.
Win by his aid and the aid disown--
He travels the fastest who travels alone


Out in a world of death far to the northward lying, 
       Under the sun and the moon, under the dusk and the day;
   Under the glimmer of stars and the purple of sunsets dying,
       Wan and waste and white, stretch the great lakes away.

   Never a bud of spring, never a laugh of summer,
       Never a dream of love, never a song of bird;
   But only the silence and white, the shores that grow chiller and dumber,
       Wherever the ice winds sob, and the griefs of winter are heard.

   Crags that are black and wet out of the grey lake looming,
       Under the sunset's flush and the pallid, faint glimmer of dawn;
   Shadowy, ghost-like shores, where midnight surfs are booming
       Thunders of wintry woe over the spaces wan.

   Lands that loom like spectres, whited regions of winter,
       Wastes of desolate woods, deserts of water and shore;
   A world of winter and death, within these regions who enter,
       Lost to summer and life, go to return no more.

   Moons that glimmer above, waters that lie white under,
       Miles and miles of lake far out under the night;
   Foaming crests of waves, surfs that shoreward thunder,
       Shadowy shapes that flee, haunting the spaces white.

   Lonely hidden bays, moon-lit, ice-rimmed, winding,
       Fringed by forests and crags, haunted by shadowy shores;
   Hushed from the outward strife, where the mighty surf is grinding
       Death and hate on the rocks, as sandward and landward it roars. 



The invisible winter wind 
Slapped our faces
And we bowed to the winter cold
As strangers we dreamt less of this wind
Chattering and phlegm drifting
From our noses hardly breathing well
I wonder the hype 
Of travelling away to foreign lands
Leaving the warm embrace of our clime
Still they bluffed us
With the visas unto the claries
Cold has eaten off  their leaves
Not even minding our hard earned 
Notes stowed in our pockets
Ready to buoy their own economy
Leaving ours shrivelling 
Like meadow in the cold.

'For Here Is Wisdom', John wrote with passionate conviction
on parchment, produced.  from one of the Seven Churches-
as mentioned in his Book of Revelation. And, how strange
in not only recording the final stages of the Worlds Death, 
but to be able to do so on material that would breathe
long enough to be transcribed, translated. . 

and accessible 
to every mortal since the Evangelist completed his mission.

That 'Wisdom' John eludes to is of warning to open eyes, and, 
see thru' the masks of the 'one' who will rear its head first
the same 'one' who will gather its Fallen Angels from Hades
and once again, like once before, will challenge Providence- 
in stages that began days after the Visitation at Fatima by
the same Lady who stood stoic that sad Day. .. 

at The Skull
where her Son was hung high on a Cross of Wood, until he died.
And appearing at Fatima to children, she shared 'Revelation'. 

John speaks boldly of 'Seals' that carry serpents and Cherubs; 
demons and Seraphs.  

beasts and Angels.  

Fallen Angels, and 
Archangels.  

the Seventh and Final Gold Seal be opened.  

over the Earth. 
Seal opened. And that is how 'Wisdom', will enable us to see
the guises of the serpents, demons and beasts who come masked
as Cheurbs, as Seraphs and Angels. And as for Michael, Raphael
and Gabriel their prowess will stun and overtake the poisoned
hearts and tongues of every rank and file.  

of Fallen Angels.





Dead men are wisest, for they know
How far the roots of flowers go,
How long a seed must rot to grow.

Dead men alone bear frost and rain
On throbless heart and heatless brain,
And feel no stir of joy or pain.

Dead men alone are satiate;
They sleep and dream and have no weight,
To curb their rest, of love or hate.

Strange, men should flee their company,
Or think me strange who long to be
Wrapped in their cool immunity. 

A poor old man had only one horse that he needed. 
One day the gate broke down and the horse walked away.
The neighbors came and said "If only you had heeded; 
We told you to fix the gate. Why did he have to stray? 

Now you are poorer than ever. Surely this is a curse.

"
The wise old man said "Do not pre-judge. It could be worse.
Whether it's a curse or a blessing we can't tell. Outcry

Not until the facts are known. Let your judgments take flight.
A few days later the horse came home with seven
Wild horses. The neighbors came and said "You were right
and we were wrong. Surely this thing came from Heaven


The wise man said "Again you speak too soon. We can't tell
If it is good or bad. Let time pass

" The man's only son
Went out to break the wild horses. One bucked and off he fell
And broke his leg. The neighbors came and said "This was one

Unfortunate thing. You were right to wait. This was bad

"
The wise man said "You people are obsessed with judging

"
Later the country went to war and all the sons were sad
except the injured one who didn't have to go trudging.

The neighbors came again and said "You were right old man.
You have your son with you. We will never see ours again




Some of our great leaders may be gone, 
But their wise words remain true today.
The truth is eternally fresh and young, 
But all lies, in due time, will fade away.

I can feel the veracity of Dr. King's words, 
Which remain as sharp as deadly swords.
I can hear the echoes of Malcolm X speech, 
Which are as clear as coconut water in a pitcher.

The words of our great leaders are eternal, 
And the truth is forever fresh and young.
Some of our great leaders may be gone, 
But their persona is still strong and powerful.

And I am silent; my murmur is dead,
My soul, sunk in a depression’s shade,
Hides in its depths the bitter exultation.
I don’t deplore my passing dream of life --
Vanish in dark, the empty apparition!
I care only for my love’s infliction,
And let me die, but only die in love

WELL then! I now do plainly see 
   This busy world and I shall ne'er agree. 
The very honey of all earthly joy 
Does of all meats the soonest cloy; 
   And they, methinks, deserve my pity 
Who for it can endure the stings, 
The crowd and buzz and murmurings, 
   Of this great hive, the city. 

Ah, yet, ere I descend to the grave 
May I a small house and large garden have; 
And a few friends, and many books, both true, 
Both wise, and both delightful too! 
   And since love ne'er will from me flee, 
A Mistress moderately fair, 
And good as guardian angels are, 
   Only beloved and loving me. 

O fountains! when in you shall I 
Myself eased of unpeaceful thoughts espy? 
O fields! O woods! when, when shall I be made 
Thy happy tenant of your shade? 
   Here 's the spring-head of Pleasure's flood: 
Here 's wealthy Nature's treasury, 
Where all the riches lie that she 
   Has coin'd and stamp'd for good. 

Pride and ambition here 
Only in far-fetch'd metaphors appear; 
Here nought but winds can hurtful murmurs scatter, 
And nought but Echo flatter. 
   The gods, when they descended, hither 
From heaven did always choose their way: 
And therefore we may boldly say 
   That 'tis the way too thither. 

Hoe happy here should I 
And one dear She live, and embracing die! 
She who is all the world, and can exclude 
In deserts solitude. 
   I should have then this only fear: 
Lest men, when they my pleasures see, 
Should hither throng to live like me, 
   And so make a city here. 


ALL that I serve will die, all my delights,
the flesh kindled from my flesh, garden and field,
the silent lilies standing in the woods,
the woods, the hill, the whole earth, all
will burn in man's evil, or dwindle
in its own age. Let the world bring on me
the sleep of darkness without stars, so I may know
my little light taken from me into the seed
of the beginning and the end, so I may bow
to mystery, and take my stand on the earth
like a tree in a field, passing without haste
or regret toward what will be, my life
a patient willing descent into the grass. 


Life's all getting and giving,
               I've only myself to give.
               What shall I do for a living?
               I've only one life to live.
               End it?  I'll not find another.
               Spend it? But how shall I best?
               Sure the wise plan is to live like a man
               And Luck may look after the rest!
               Largesse! Largesse, Fortune!
               Give or hold at your will.
               If I've no care for Fortune,
               Fortune must follow me still.

               Bad Luck, she is never a lady
               But the commonest wench on the street,
               Shuffling, shabby and shady,
               Shameless to pass or meet.
               Walk with her once--it's a weakness!
               Talk to her twice. It's a crime!
               Thrust her away when she gives you "good day"
               And the besom won't board you next time.
               Largesse! Largesse, Fortune!
               What is Your Ladyship's mood?
               If I have no care for Fortune,
               My Fortune is bound to be good!

               Good Luck she is never a lady 
               But the cursedest quean alive!
               Tricksy,  wincing  and  jady,
               Kittle to lead or drive.
               Greet her--she's hailing a stranger!
               Meet her--she's busking to leave.
               Let her alone for a shrew  to the bone,
               And the hussy comes plucking your sleeve!
               Largesse!  Largesse, Fortune!
               I'll neither follow nor flee.
               If I don't run after Fortune,
               Fortune must run after me!



               [In the vale of Grasmere, by the side of an old highway 
leading to Ambleside, is a gate, which, from time out of 
mind, has been called the Wishing-gate, from a belief that 
wishes formed or indulged there have a favorable issue.]



HOPE rules a land forever green:
        Are confident and gay;
Clouds at her bidding disappear;
Points she to aught?---the bliss draws near,
        And Fancy smooths the way.

Not such the land of Wishes---there
Dwell fruitless day-dreams, lawless prayer,
     And thoughts with things at strife;
Yet how forlorn, should ye depart
Ye superstitions of the heart,
     How poor, were human life!

When magic lore abjured its might,
Ye did not forfeit one dear right,
     One tender claim abate;
Witness this symbol of your sway,
Surnving near the public way,
     The rustic Wishing-gate!

Inquire not if the faery race
Shed kindly influence on the place,
     Ere northward they retired;
If here a warrior left a spell,
Panting for glory as he fell;
     Or here a saint expired.

Enough that all arouud is fair,
Composed with Nature's finest care,
     And in her fondest love---
Peace to embosom and content---
To overawe the turbulent,
     The selfish to reprove.

Yea! even the Stranger from afar,
Reclining on this moss-grown bar,
     Unknowing, and unknown,
The infection of the ground partakes,
Longing for his Beloved---who maker
     All happiness her own.
 
Then why should conscious Spirits fear
The mystic stirrings that are here,
     The ancient faith disclaim?
The local Genius ne'er befriends
Desires whose course in folly ends,
     Whose just reward is shame.

Smile if thou wilt, but not in scorn,
If some, by ceaseless pains outworn,
     Here crave an easier lot;
If some have thirsted to renew
A broken vow, or bind a true,
     With firmer, holier knot.

And not in vain, when thoughts are cast
Upon the irrevocable past,
     Some Penitent sincere
May for a worthier future sigh,
While trickles from his downcast eye
     No unavailing tear.

The Worldling, pining to be freed
From turmoil, who would turn or speed
     The current of his fate,
Might stop before this favored scene,
At Nature's call, nor blush to lean
     Upon the Wishing-gate.

The Sage, who feels how blind, how weak
Is man, though loth such help to seek,
     Yet, passing, here might pause,
And thirst for insight to allay
Misgiving, while the crimson day
     In quietness withdraws;
 
Or when the church-clock's knell profound
To Time's first step across the bound
     Of midnight makes reply;
Time pressing on with starry crest,
To filial sleep upon the breast
     Of dread eternity. 

Strephon, whose Person ev'ry Grace 
 Was careful to adorn; 
Thought, by the Beauties of his Face, 
In Silvia's Love to find a place, 
 And wonder'd at her Scorn. 
With Bows, and Smiles he did his Part; 
 But Oh! 'twas all in vain: 
A Youth less Fine, a Youth of Art 
Had talk'd himself into her Heart, 
 And wou'd not out again. 

Strephon with change of Habits press'd, 
 And urg'd her to admire; 
His Love alone the Other dress'd, 
As Verse, or Prose became it best, 
 And mov'd her soft Desire. 

This found, his courtship Strephon ends, 
 Or makes it to his Glass; 
There, in himself now seeks amends, 
Convinc'd, that where a Wit pretends, 
 A Beau is but an Ass. 

I HAVE walked a great while over the snow, 
And I am not tall nor strong. 
My clothes are wet, and my teeth are set, 
And the way was hard and long. 
I have wandered over the fruitful earth, 
But I never came here before. 
Oh, lift me over the threshold, and let me in at the door! 
 
The cutting wind is a cruel foe. 
I dare not stand in the blast. 
My hands are stone, and my voice a groan, 
And the worst of death is past. 
I am but a little maiden still, 
My little white feet are sore. 
Oh, lift me over the threshold, and let me in at the door! 
 
Her voice was the voice that women have, 
Who plead for their heart's desire. 
She came--she came--and the quivering flame 
Sunk and died in the fire. 
It never was lit again on my hearth 
Since I hurried across the floor, 
To lift her over the threshold, and let her in at the door. 



I staid the night for shelter at a farm
 Behind the mountains, with a mother and son,
 Two old-believers. They did all the talking.

 MOTHER Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits
 She could call up to pass a winter evening,
 But won't, should be burned at the stake or something.
 Summoning spirits isn't 'Button, button,
 Who's got the button,' I would have them know.

 SON: Mother can make a common table rear
 And kick with two legs like an army mule.

 MOTHER: And when I've done it, what good have I
 done?
 Rather than tip a table for you, let me
 Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me.
 He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him
 How could that be -  I thought the dead were souls,
 He broke my trance. Don't that make you suspicious
 That there's something the dead are keeping back?
 Yes, there's something the dead are keeping back.

 SON: You wouldn't want to tell him what we have
 Up attic, mother?

 MOTHER: Bones -  a skeleton.

 SON: But the headboard of mother's bed is pushed
 Against the' attic door: the door is nailed.
 It's harmless. Mother hears it in the night
 Halting perplexed behind the barrier
 Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get
 Is back into the cellar where it came from.

 MOTHER: We'll never let them, will we, son! We'll
 never !

 SON: It left the cellar forty years ago
 And carried itself like a pile of dishes
 Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen,
 Another from the kitchen to the bedroom,
 Another from the bedroom to the attic,
 Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped
 it.
 Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs
 MOTHER: The only fault my husband found with me - 
 I went to sleep before I went to bed,
 Especially in winter when the bed
 Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow.
 The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs
 Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me,
 But left an open door to cool the room off
 So as to sort of turn me out of it.
 I was just coming to myself enough
 To wonder where the cold was coming from,
 When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom
 And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar.
 The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on
 When there was water in the cellar in spring
 Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone
 Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step,
 The way a man with one leg and a crutch,
 Or a little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile:
 It wasn't anyone who could be there.
 The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked
 And swollen tight and buried under snow.
 The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust
 And swollen tight and buried under snow.
 It was the bones. I knew them -  and good reason.
 My first impulse was to get to the knob
 And hold the door. But the bones didn't try
 The door; they halted helpless on the landing,
 Waiting for things to happen in their favour.'
 The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.
 I never could have done the thing I did
 If the wish hadn't been too strong in me
 To see how they were mounted for this walk.
 I had a vision of them put together
 Not like a man, but like a chandelier.
 So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.
 A moment he stood balancing with emotion,
 And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire
 Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.
 Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)
 Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,
 The way he did in life once; but this time
 I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,
 And fell back from him on the floor myself.
 The finger-pieces slid in all directions.
 (Where did I see one of those pieces lately?
 Hand me my button-box- it must be there.)
 I sat up on the floor and shouted, 'Toffile,
 It's coming up to you.' It had its choice
 Of the door to the cellar or the hall.
 It took the hall door for the novelty,
 And set off briskly for so slow a thing,
 Stillgoing every which way in the joints, though,
 So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,
 >From the slap I had just now given its hand.
 I listened till it almost climbed the stairs
 >From the hall to the only finished bedroom,
 Before I got up to do anything;
 Then ran and shouted, 'Shut the bedroom door,
 Toffile, for my sake!' 'Company?' he said,
 'Don't make me get up; I'm too warm in bed.'
 So lying forward weakly on the handrail
 I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light
 (The kitchen had been dark) I had to own
 I could see nothing. 'Toffile, I don't see it.
 It's with us in the room though. It's the bones.'
 'What bones?' 'The cellar bones- out of the grave.'
 That made him throw his bare legs out of bed
 And sit up by me and take hold of me.
 I wanted to put out the light and see
 If I could see it, or else mow the room,
 With our arms at the level of our knees,
 And bring the chalk-pile down. 'I'll tell you what-
 It's looking for another door to try.
 The uncommonly deep snow has made him think
 Of his old song, The Wild Colonial Boy,
 He always used to sing along the tote-road.
 He's after an open door to get out-doors.
 Let's trap him with an open door up attic.'
 Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,
 Almost the moment he was given an opening,
 The steps began to climb the attic stairs.
 I heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them.
 'Quick !' I slammed to the door and held the knob.
 'Toffile, get nails.' I made him nail the door shut,
 And push the headboard of the bed against it.
 Then we asked was there anything
 Up attic that we'd ever want again.
 The attic was less to us than the cellar.
 If the bones liked the attic, let them have it.
 Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes
 Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed
 Behind the door and headboard of the bed,
 Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,
 With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,
 That's what I sit up in the dark to say-
 To no one any more since Toffile died.
 Let them stay in the attic since they went there.
 I promised Toffile to be cruel to them
 For helping them be cruel once to him.

 SON: We think they had a grave down in the cellar.

 MOTHER: We know they had a grave down in the cellar.

 SON: We never could find out whose bones they were.

 MOTHER: Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once.
 They were a man's his father killed for me.
 I mean a man he killed instead of me.
 The least I could do was to help dig their grave.
 We were about it one night in the cellar.
 Son knows the story: but 'twas not for him
 To tell the truth, suppose the time had come.
 Son looks surprised to see me end a lie
 We'd kept all these years between ourselves
 So as to have it ready for outsiders.
 But to-night I don't care enough to lie-
 I don't remember why I ever cared.
 Toffile, if he were here, I don't believe
 Could tell you why he ever cared himself-


 She hadn't found the finger-bone she wanted
 Among the buttons poured out in her lap.
 I verified the name next morning: Toffile.
 The rural letter-box said Toffile Lajway. 


A weariness within the bones 
drifts somberly on a cloud. 
It latches on keeps it grip, 
fighting its own kind. 

Poisoned hosts see not in, 
but above and under eye. 
Repel and rip the wounds 
of they that shall not pass. 

Mutation of this sorry pest 
floats and sits asunder, 
now only the witnesses that were never there, 
can claim to need no cure. 


Like a grey shadow lurking in the light, 
He ventures forth along the edge of night; 
With silent foot he scouts the coulie's rim 
And scents the carrion awaiting him. 
His savage eyeballs lurid with a flare 
Seen but in unfed beasts which leave their lair 
To wrangle with their fellows for a meal 
Of bones ill-covered. Sets he forth to steal, 
To search and snarl and forage hungrily; 
A worthless prairie vagabond is he. 
Luckless the settler's heifer which astray 
Falls to his fangs and violence a prey; 
Useless her blatant calling when his teeth 
Are fast upon her quivering flank--beneath 
His fell voracity she falls and dies 
With inarticulate and piteous cries, 
Unheard, unheeded in the barren waste, 
To be devoured with savage greed and haste. 
Up the horizon once again he prowls 
And far across its desolation howls; 
Sneaking and satisfied his lair he gains 
And leaves her bones to bleach upon the plains. 


A wolf on a hill
waiting for her male

I sat beside her 
very still

she lays down
on my lap

I pet her gently
she sits up straight

gets ready to pounce
I get ready to move

she tells me to stop
she wont hurt me 

so i sit back down
she jumped into me

I realized she was my spirit
lonely and always waiting



When the church-village slumbers
And the last songs are sung,
When the grey mist arising,
Is o'er the marshes hung,
'Tis then the woods forsaking,
Their way cross country taking,
Nine howling wolves come hungering for food.


Behind the first,--the grey one,--
Trot seven more of black,
Close on their hoary leader;
As rearguard of the pack
The red wolf limps, all bloody,
His paws with gore still ruddy
As after his companions grim he pants.

When through the village lurking
Nought gives them check or fright,
No watch dog dares to bellow,
The peasant ghastly white,
His breath can scarce be taking,
His limbs withhold from shaking--
While prayers of terror freeze upon his lips!

About the church they circle
And softly slink away
To prowl about the priest's farm,
Then of a sudden they
Are round the drink shop turning,
Fain some bad word be learning--
From peasants drinking noisily within.

With fully thirteen bullets
Thy weapon must be armed,
And with a wad of goat's hair;
Then thou wilt fight unharmed.
Fire calmly,--and before all
Will the leader, the grey, fall,
The rest will surely follow one by one.

When the cock wakes the village
From out its morning dream,
Thou wilt behold the corpses--
Nine she-wolves by the stream!
On the right lies the grey one,
To left in frost the lame one--



There are wolves in the next room waiting
With heads bent low, thrust out, breathing
At nothing in the dark; between them and me
A white door patched with light from the hall
Where it seems never (so still is the house)
A man has walked from the front door to the stair.
It has all been forever. Beasts claw the floor.
I have brooded on angels and archfiends
But no man has ever sat where the next room's
Crowded with wolves, and for the honor of man
I affirm that never have I before. Now while
I have looked for the evening star at a cold window
And whistled when Arcturus spilt his light,
I've heard the wolves scuffle, and said: So this
Is man; so-what better conclusion is there-
The day will not follow night, and the heart
Of man has a little dignity, but less patience
Than a wolf's, and a duller sense that cannot
Smell its own mortality. (This and other
Meditations will be suited to other times
After dog silence howls his epitaph.)
Now remember courage, go to the door,
Open it and see whether coiled on the bed
Or cringing by the wall, a savage beast
Maybe with golden hair, with deep eyes
Like a bearded spider on a sunlit floor
Will snarl-and man can never be alone. 

The saris go by me from the embassies.

Cloth from the moon.  Cloth from another planet.  
They look back at the leopard like the leopard.


And I. . . .
                this print of mine, that has kept its color
Alive through so many cleanings; this dull null
Navy I wear to work, and wear from work, and so
To my bed, so to my grave, with no
Complaints, no comment: neither from my chief,
The Deputy Chief Assistant, nor his chief--
Only I complain. . . . this serviceable
Body that no sunlight dyes, no hand suffuses
But, dome-shadowed, withering among columns,
Wavy beneath fountains--small, far-off, shining
In the eyes of animals, these beings trapped
As I am trapped but not, themselves, the trap,
Aging, but without knowledge of their age,
Kept safe here, knowing not of death, for death--
Oh, bars of my own body, open, open!

The world goes by my cage and never sees me.
And there come not to me, as come to these,
The wild beasts, sparrows pecking the llamas' grain,
Pigeons settling on the bears' bread, buzzards
Tearing the meat the flies have clouded. . . .
                                               Vulture,
When you come for the white rat that the foxes left, 
Take off the red helmet of your head, the black
Wings that have shadowed me, and step to me as man:
The wild brother at whose feet the white wolves fawn,
To whose hand of power the great lioness
Stalks, purring. . . .
                                You know what I was,
You see what I am: change me, change me

All the love in the world is but a drop in the ocean, 
When one already has a river in mind.
She moved with such grace and beauty, 
Such an angel is hard to find. 

She sat by the river, 
Lying in the sun.
I wished to join her, 
But Courage, I had none.

Her hazel hair shone like the water, 
Glistening like gold.
She walked through the wood, 
Eternally beautiful, strong and bold.

Her lips so soft, her eyes so gentle, 
Few men are lucky to taste her kiss.
She sang softly by the river bank, 
Her sweet sound is what I most miss.

For she has my heart, But I not her's, 
She moves as the river flows.
But I will stay here and wait, 
Where the memory of her never goes. 

The woman in the ordinary pudgy downcast girl
is crouching with eyes and muscles clenched.
Round and pebble smooth she effaces herself
under ripples of conversation and debate.
The woman in the block of ivory soap
has massive thighs that neigh,
great breasts that blare and strong arms that trumpet.
The woman of the golden fleece
laughs uproariously from the belly
inside the girl who imitates
who fishes for herself in other's eyes,
who stoops and creeps to make herself smaller.
In her bottled up is a woman peppery as curry,
a yam of a woman of butter and brass,
compounded of acid and sweet like a pineapple,
like a handgrenade set to explode,
like goldenrod ready to bloom. 




The wonder of you.
The wonder of life.
The wonder wheel that spins to a different drummer.
A hot summer.
A cold embrace.
A race to the end.
A bend in the road.
Road star in a mustang.
 Orange flavored.
Tang The dead canary does sing any more.
Ever more on its shore.
Why not Today she cried.
Lied.
At the bottom of the sea.
Do you agree.
Cred becomes him.
Greed.
Now is gone, money a tool in manes eye.
Cry baby cry.
New day comes back again.
Main stay, desert plain.
On the verge of creation.
Continued. 

Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day,
I paused and said, "I will turn back from here.
No, I will go on farther -- and we shall see


The hard snow held me, save where now and then
One foot went through. The view was all in lines
Straight up and down of tall slim trees
Too much alike to mark or name a place by
So as to say for certain I was here
Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.
A small bird flew before me. He was careful
To put a tree between us when he lighted,
And say no word to tell me who he was
Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.
He thought that I was after him for a feather --
The white one in his tail; like one who takes
Everything said as personal to himself.
One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.
And then there was a pile of wood for which
I forgot him and let his little fear
Carry him off the way I might have gone,
Without so much as wishing him good-night.
He went behind it to make his last stand.
It was a cord of maple, cut and split
And piled -- and measured, four by four by eight.
And not another like it could I see.
No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.
And it was older sure than this year's cutting,
Or even last year's or the year's before.
The wood was gray and the bark warping off it
And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis
Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.
What held it though on one side was a tree
Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,
These latter about to fall. I thought that only
Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
Could so forget his handiwork on which
He spent himself, the labor of his ax,
And leave it there far from a useful fireplace
To warm the frozen swamp as best it could
With the slow smokeless burning of decay.


If I were to walk this way
Hand in hand with Grief,
I should mark that maple-spray
Coming into leaf.
I should note how the old burrs
Rot upon the ground.
Yes, though Grief should know me hers
While the world goes round,
It could not if truth be said
This was lost on me:
A rock-maple showing red,
Burrs beneath a tree.



The brightly-painted horse
Had a boy's face,
And four small wheels
Under his feet,

Plus a long string
To pull him by this way and that
Across the floor,
Should you care to.

A string in-waiting
That slipped away
In many wiles
From each and every try.



	Knock and they'll answer,
Mother told me.

So I climbed four flights of stairs
And went in unannounced.

And found a small wooden toy
For the taking

In the ensuing emptiness
And the fading daylight

That still gives me a shudder
As if I held the key to mysteries in my hand.



	Where's the Lost and Found Department,
And the quiet entry,
The undeveloped film
Of the few clear moments
Of our blurred lives?

Where's the drop of blood
And the teeny nail
That pricked my finger
As I bent down to touch the toy

And caught its eye?



	Evening light,

Make me a Sunday
Go-to meeting shadow
For my toy.

My dearest memories are
Steep stair-wells
In dusty buildings
On dead-end streets,

Where I talk to the walls
And closed doors
As if they understood me.



	
The wooden toy sitting pretty.

No, quieter than that.

Like the sound of eyebrows
Raised by a villain
In a silent movie.

Psst, someone said behind my back.



Oh these woods! So deep and thick
Standing at the edge, gives me the creeps
Entering its deep recesses, my heart skips
Urge to know its mystery, too strong to resist

Once inside, my fear might take leave
From curiosity, my foot might take a leap
The dark secrets, the trees might whisper from atop
Emerge I might, a rich soul full of deep thoughts. 



The binocular owl,
fastened to a limb
like a lantern
all night long,

sees where all
the other birds sleep:
towhee under leaves,
titmouse deep

in a twighouse,
sapsucker gripped
to a knothole lip,
redwing in the reeds,

swallow in the willow,
flicker in the oak -
but cannot see poor
whippoorwill

under the hill
in deadbrush nest,
who's awake, too -
with stricken eye

flayed by the moon
her brindled breast
repeats, repeats, repeats its plea
for cruelty. 



Find the word, understand the word,
Depend on the word;
The word is heaven and space, the word the earth,
The word the universe.
The word is in our ears, the word is on our tongues,
The word the idol.
The word is the holy book, the word is harmony,
The word is music.
The word is magic, the word the Guru.
The word is the body, the word is the spirit, the word is being,
The word Not-being.
The word is man, the word is woman,
The Worshipped Great.
The word is the seen and unseen, the word is the existent
And the non-existent.



Know the word, says Kabir,
The word is All-powerful. 

I was searching a word
That escaped from 

At last I found
That in the terrace, 
When it was sitting 
with children and 
Staring at your lips 
at the time
of your tuition class

Now I know, 
The word was not escaped
but eloped with 
Your Lips. 

words are heard, or read; 
communicating

to an audience yourself, 
or others

the thought is the word, and
the word is the thought

received in mind it is thought, 
pictured

in a painting, or merely a drawing
in black, and white

interpretation is the prerogative 
of each receiver mind


Sometimes you can see yourself
In a burial suit stretched-out in a coffin, 
Your hands cold and gray, expressionless face.
Into the fog of meaninglessness.

There are no shoulders I can kiss
That will remain forever majestic
In a sleeveless summer blouse, 
But perhaps they’ll lie beside me
In an adjoining grave.

I’m trying to carve the word love
Into stones impenetrable by time and weather. 


Water vapors from Niagara
Awakened me
Feeling so fresh
And alive
Leaving behind the hustle
Of demanding life
I could smell the powerful
Perfumes of paradise
The angels whisper to my ears
"Don’t kill your thought, 
The world would not be the same
Without you"
Olfactory sense of wisdom
Sneaks into my veins
I’ll write beautiful pieces
Like the Angels
So beautiful
Irresistible


Thank you for firing me, 
Now, I am enjoying an extended paid vacation.
I do not have to get up and shower early
In the morning. My mission
Is to read, write, relax, exercise, and enjoy life, 
While you, seemingly, are striving like a damned slave, 
Eat pizzas, pepperonis, pretzels, and a giant sausage.
Well, you will never have a good life.
The rhinoceros saw you in the park
Yesterday and she swore that you are fatter
Than her.  She also said that you‘re afraid of the dark, 
And in your wildest dream, you think that you’re prettier
Than the disguised elephant of the New Orleans Mardi Gras.
Tomorrow is Halloween, please wear the fancy top
That the hippopotamus wore last night.
Dress provocatively sexy and out-of sight. 



Three words will I name thee--around and about,
 From the lip to the lip, full of meaning, they flee;
But they had not their birth in the being without,
 And the heart, not the lip, must their oracle be!
And all worth in the man shall forever be o'er
When in those three words he believes no more.

Man is made free!--Man by birthright is free,
 Though the tyrant may deem him but born for his tool.
Whatever the shout of the rabble may be--
 Whatever the ranting misuse of the fool--
Still fear not the slave, when he breaks from his chain,
For the man made a freeman grows safe in his gain.

And virtue is more than a shade or a sound,
 And man may her voice, in this being, obey;
And though ever he slip on the stony ground,
 Yet ever again to the godlike way,
To the science of good though the wise may be blind,
Yet the practice is plain to the childlike mind.

 While the human will rocks, like a reed, to and fro,
Lives the will of the holy--a purpose sublime,
 A thought woven over creation below;
Changing and shifting the all we inherit,
But changeless through all one immutable spirit

Hold fast the three words of belief--though about
 From the lip to the lip, full of meaning, they flee;
Yet they take not their birth from the being without--
 But a voice from within must their oracle be;
And never all worth in the man can be o'er,
Till in those three words he believes no more. 

Three errors there are, that forever are found
 On the lips of the good, on the lips of the best;
But empty their meaning and hollow their sound--
 And slight is the comfort they bring to the breast.
The fruits of existence escape from the clasp
Of the seeker who strives but those shadows to grasp--

So long as man dreams of some age in this life
 When the right and the good will all evil subdue;
For the right and the good lead us ever to strife,
 And wherever they lead us the fiend will pursue.
And (till from the earth borne, and stifled at length)
The earth that he touches still gifts him with strength!

So long as man fancies that fortune will live,
 Like a bride with her lover, united with worth;
For her favors, alas! to the mean she will give--
 And virtue possesses no title to earth!
That foreigner wanders to regions afar,
Where the lands of her birthright immortally are!

So long as man dreams that, to mortals a gift,
 The truth in her fulness of splendor will shine;
The veil of the goddess no earth-born may lift,
 And all we can learn is--to guess and divine!
Dost thou seek, in a dogma, to prison her form?
The spirit flies forth on the wings of the storm!

O, noble soul! fly from delusions like these,
 More heavenly belief be it thine to adore;
Where the ear never hearkens, the eye never sees,
 Meet the rivers of beauty and truth evermore!
Not without thee the streams--there the dull seek them;--No!
Look within thee--behold both the fount and the flow




My grandmother’s hands recognize grapes,   
the damp shine of a goat’s new skin.   
When I was sick they followed me,
I woke from the long fever to find them   
covering my head like cool prayers.

My grandmother’s days are made of bread,   
a round pat-pat and the slow baking.
She waits by the oven watching a strange car   
circle the streets. Maybe it holds her son,   
lost to America. More often, tourists,   
who kneel and weep at mysterious shrines.   
She knows how often mail arrives,
how rarely there is a letter.
When one comes, she announces it, a miracle,   
listening to it read again and again
in the dim evening light.

My grandmother’s voice says nothing can surprise her.
Take her the shotgun wound and the crippled baby.   
She knows the spaces we travel through,   
the messages we cannot send—our voices are short   
and would get lost on the journey.
Farewell to the husband’s coat,
the ones she has loved and nourished,
who fly from her like seeds into a deep sky.   
They will plant themselves. We will all die.

When she talks of the orchard and the new olive press,   
when she tells the stories of Joha and his foolish wisdoms,   
He is her first thought, what she really thinks of is His name.
"Answer, if you hear the words under the words—
otherwise it is just a world with a lot of rough edges,   
difficult to get through, and our pockets full of stones."The Work of Her that went,
The Toil of Fellows done - 
In Ovens green our Mother bakes,
By Fires of the Sun. 


At the end of my coping
At my falling apart
The work of my angel
Repaired my poor heart

She took me from darkness
Fear and despair
In the midst of my suffering
She answered my prayer

Her career, my angel
Took away my pain
She took me from heartache
That was sending me insane

She made such a difference
To my world, to my mind
She's truly an angel
Of the heaven-sending kind


Rising early in the morning,
We proceed to light the fire,
Then our Majesty adorning
In its work-a-day attire,
We embark without delay
On the duties of the day.

First, we polish off some batches
Of political despatches,
And foreign politicians circumvent;
Then, if business isn't heavy,
We may hold a Royal LEVEE,
Or ratify some Acts of Parliament:
Then we probably review the household troops -
With the usual "Shalloo humps" and "Shalloo hoops!"
Or receive with ceremonial and state
An interesting Eastern Potentate.
After that we generally
Go and dress our private VALET -

(It's a rather nervous duty - he a touchy little man) -
Write some letters literary
For our private secretary -
(He is shaky in his spelling, so we help him if we can.)
Then, in view of cravings inner,
We go down and order dinner;
Or we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate -
Spend an hour in titivating
All our Gentlemen-in-Waiting;
Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State.
Oh, philosophers may sing
Of the troubles of a King,
Yet the duties are delightful, and the privileges great;
But the privilege and pleasure
That we treasure beyond measure
Is to run on little errands for the Ministers of State!

After luncheon (making merry
On a bun and glass of sherry),
If we've nothing in particular to do,
We may make a Proclamation,
Or receive a Deputation -
Then we possibly create a Peer or two.
Then we help a fellow-creature on his path
With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath:
Or we dress and toddle off in semi-State
To a festival, a function, or a FETE.
Then we go and stand as sentry
At the Palace (private entry),
Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and fro,
While the warrior on duty
Goes in search of beer and beauty
(And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go).
He relieves us, if he's able,
Just in time to lay the table.

Then we dine and serve the coffee; and at half-past twelve or one,
With a pleasure that's emphatic;
Then we seek our little attic
With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done.
Oh, philosophers may sing
Of the troubles of a King,
But of pleasures there are many and of troubles there are none;
And the culminating pleasure
That we treasure beyond measure
Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done

I strode into the crowded gym with a program 
for that particular day, starting with sit-ups
on the floor, to flatten the stomach more.
I stood up, legs apart and knees straight, 
to do some floor-touching exercises, 
left to right; right to left, swiveling, loving 
to feel the thigh and calf muscles stretching.

I checked out some of the weights machines: 
the multipress, sitting and pushing up weights
I then took a seat at the chest press, pushing out.
I did the seated row, rowing upstream then down
with the weight adjustment set quite low.
I was once a lightweight at exercise myself, although
I never wanted to be a muscle-bound body-builder.

I stepped onto the treadmill for the third scene, 
pushed  buttons for the tell-all red numbers onscreen; 
the digits showed distance, minutes and seconds to run.



"Love built a stately house, where Fortune came,
And spinning fancies, she was heard to say
That her fine cobwebs did support the frame,
Whereas they were supported by the same;
But Wisdom quickly swept them all away.

The Pleasure came, who, liking not the fashion,
Began to make balconies, terraces,
Till she had weakened all by alteration;
But reverend laws, and many a proclomation
Reformed all at length with menaces.

Then entered Sin, and with that sycamore
Whose leaves first sheltered man from drought and dew,
Working and winding slily evermore,
The inward walls and summers cleft and tore;
But Grace shored these, and cut that as it grew.

Then Sin combined with death in a firm band,
To raze the building to the very floor;
Which they effected,--none could them withstand;
But Love and Grace took Glory by the hand,
And built a braver palace than before. 

The air supports life. 
The canopy of leaves keeps my skin ivory.
 I am exposed and I am free. 
The sun rises and falls and all I have ever seen
is the masterpiece of life that I am the mother of.
I sleep in peace. 
I am never alone.
My bed is woven from soft vines. 
No thorns or blemishes exist in my world.
I feel heat from the sun and I bathe in cool mist
from falling water. 
My feet splash the water and moss goes through my toes. 
I am alive and not alone. 
My skin is sweet; 
my hair is long and soft.
I do not hunger nor do I thirst. 
I am full; always full. 
Something slithers up my thigh and between my breasts.

A tongue tickles my neck and then the most beautiful golden fruit drops at my soft feet. 

I take it like a wild animal and it is left to a few seeds. 
The clouds roll in cold. 
My soft feet crack
and I am alone with a scaled creature 
hissing and as it goes I feel pain. 
I know I am dead inside for I made sin come and be real. 
I am Eve.

stabs you when you least expect it.
When the tensions are high, 
and you have to cut through it.
And when you chop up your life, 
to make it more interesting.

The world around me is a lecture, 
being somewhere you don’t want to be.
Just sitting there zoning out, 
into a better place.
Looking around not really noticing, 
the people around you, 
or what the say.

The world around me is a storm.
It will be nice one moment, 
and the next it will be hectic.
Be waiting for that nice day, 
but it don’t seem like it’s clearing up.
Wishing you could have that one nice day, 
but the world wants it to be dark and unhappy. 

The world around me is a story.
It can be long and interesting.
Or it can be short and boring.
Open the imagination and it can do wonders, 
to any story. 

It is wonderful to see multiracial boys and girls
Accompanying the football or soccer players
On the field. Let's applaud them, ring the bells, 
And say no to racism; this is a clear defeat for the haters, 
Who can rant all they want, 
Like wild and untamed beasts.
This time, they must change or repent; 
Now, the entire world stands for Love and Peace.

All in the rhythm, one Cup, and one race; 
All in the world, one Love, and one place.

It is comforting to witness this majestic or godly event, 
Where every four years countless countries get together, 
To play football, to celebrate the beauty of the human spirit.
Let's say no to racism and hatred, let's chant together: 
There is no room or space for discrimination in this world.
The haters, as customarily, can swear, crawl and swirl, 
Like slimy snakes, primeval, and despicable beasts; 
Now, the entire world stands for Love and Peace.

All in the rhythm, one Love, and one race; 
All in the world, one Cup, and one face.


--BUT if the foe no more without presides,
There is an inner chamber where it hides ;
In that strong hold prepares its last defence ;
And none but heavenly arms can drive it thence.
Pursues its flight to that interior throne.
This is the test that makes his title clear ;
For only they approve their aim sincere,
Who seek the flattering world to dispossess
All modes by man devised to purchase bliss,
Full well he knows are cheaper far than this :
Hence the attempt, with penance, pain, and loss,
And prayers, and alms, to frame a lighter cross.

To travel barefoot to some hallowed shrine,
If this would do, how soon should Heaven be mine !
To run with patience up to Zion's gate ;
To hold affections fixt on things above ;
To value heavenly more than earthly love ;
More than the world's opprobrious calumny ;
To keep faith's prospects prominent and clear ;
To seek not rest, nor wish to find it here ;
Is harder work--too hard for arms like ours,
Opposed by principalities and powers,
Had He not covenanted to supply
Helmet and shield from Heaven's armory.

A ceaseless round of mummery to fulfil,
Leaves the world's empire unmolested still :
Nor more effective every outward way,
By which we seek to disavow its sway.
The downcast look, grave habit, slow address,
Are vain attempts to make the labour less ;
There is an inward army to pursue ;
A mere external conflict will not do.

They who sincerely bid the world depart
Not only from the house, but from the heart,
Retreating wisely, where its torrent roars,
And anxious still to shut it out of doors,
Contract their wishes to the sober size
Of fire-side comfort, and domestic ties ;
Yet they should deem the battle but begun,
Nor think at such light cost the victory won.
Whatever passes as a cloud, between
The mental eye of faith and things unseen,
Causing that better world to disappear,
Or seem unlovely, and the present dear,
That is our world, our idol, though it bear
Affection's impress, or devotion's air.

They who the quiet walks of life may choose,
Partly for Heaven's sake, partly for the muse ; 
Whose taste had led them from the giddy train,
Even if conscience did not say 'refrain ;'
Though wise and good the choice, had need beware,
They shun an obvious, for a hidden snare ; 
The fair, bright paths of wit and learning may
Lead off directly from the narrow way.
The pride of intellect, the conscious height
The soul attains to in her mental flight,
At length may cause a less exalted seat
To seem too lowly at the Saviour's feet.
Music, the pencil, nature, books, the muse,
Have charms, and Heaven designed them for our use ;
Yet who that knows and loves them, but could tell
The world disguised in all, in each may dwell,
With charm as fatal, with a spell as strong,
As that which circles pleasure's vacant throng.

'Tis true : and therefore some pronounce in haste,
(Urged less by conscience than by want of taste)
A sweeping censure on the cultured mind ;
And safety hope in ignorance to find.
Alas ! they know not how the world can cheat ;
Or rather, know not their own heart's deceit :
The ground that lies uncultured and unsown,
With rampant weeds is quickly overgrown.
And they who leave the mental field undrest,
Deeming all knowledge useless but the best,
And give those hours that duty freely spares,
Not to superior, but to vulgar cares,
Will find these lead from heavenly converse back,
Not less than those, and by a meaner track.
'Twas by no mental feast, no studious thought,
Who lost the unction of His gracious word,
Which, waiting at His feet, another heard.
Those toils engrossed her that may hold the heart
In closest bondage from the better part :
And though that board was spread for such a guest,
As none may now bid welcome to a feast,
The busy Marthas, serving, cumbered still.

Ask the good housewife, mid her bustling maids,
If ne'er the world her humbler sphere invades.
But if (unconscious of its secret sway)
She own it not, her eager looks betray.
Yes, there you find it, spite of locks and bars,
Hid in the store-room with her jams and jars ;
It gilds her china, in her cupboard shines,
Works at the vent-peg of her home-made wines,
Each varied dainty to her board supplies,

The charms of mental converse some may fear,
Who scruple not to lend a ready ear
To kitchen tales, of scandal, strife, and love,
Which make the maid and mistress hand and glove ; 
And ever deem the sin and danger less,
Merely for being in a vulgar dress.

Thus the world haunts, in forms of varied kind,
The intellectual and the groveling mind ;
Now, sparkling in the muse's fair attire,
Now, red and greasy at the kitchen fire.
And were you called to give a casting voice,
One to select, from such a meagre choice,
Deciding which life's purpose most mistook--
Would you not say,--the worldly-minded cook ? 
Not intellectual vanity to flatter ;
--Simply, that mind precedence claims of matter.

And she, whose nobler course is seen to shine,
At once, with human knowledge and divine ;
Who mental culture and domestic rites
In close and graceful amity unites ;
Striving to hold them in their proper place,
Not interfering with her heavenly race ;
Whose constant aim it is, and fervent prayer,
On earthly ground to breathe celestial air ;--
Still, she could witness how the world betrays,
Steals softly in by unsuspected ways,
Her yielding soul from heavenly converse bears,
And holds her captive in its silken snares.
Could she not tell the trifles that are brought
To rival Heaven, and drive it from her thought ?
--Her heart (unconscious of the flowery trap)
Caught in the sprigs upon a baby's cap ;
Thence disengaged, its freedom boasts awhile,
Till taken captive by the baby's smile.

But oh, how mournful when resistance fails,
The conflict slackens, and the foe prevails !
For instance--yonder matron, who appears
Softly descending in the vale of years ; 
And yet, with health, and constant care bestowed,
Still comely, embonpoint, and à la mode. 
Once in her youthful days, her heart was warm ;
At least, her feelings wore devotion's form ;
And ever since, to quell the rising doubt,
She makes that grain of godliness eke out.
With comfort still, the distant day she sees,
When grief or terror brought her to her knees ;
And bade her welcome to the church's fold.
There still she rests, her words, her forms the same ;
There holds profession's lamp without the flame :
Her Sabbaths come and go, with even pace ;
Year after year you find her in her place,
And still no change apparent, saving that
Of time and fashion, in her face and hat.
She stands or kneels as usual, hears and sings ;
Goes home and dines, and talks of other things ;
Enjoys her comforts with as strong a gout 
As if they were not fading from her view
And still is telling what she means to do :
Talks of events that happen to befall,
Not like a stranger, passing from it all,
But eager, anxious in their issue still,
Hoping this will not be, or that it will ;
Getting, enjoying, all that can be had ;
Amused with trifles, and at trifles sad :
While hope still whispers in her willing ears,
'Soul, thou hast goods laid up for many years.'
A few brief words her character portray--
--This world contents her, if she might but stay.
When true and fervent pilgrims round her press,
She inly wishes that their zeal were less.
Their works of love, their spirit, faith, and prayers,
Their calm indifference to the world's affairs,
Reproach her deadhess, and she fain, for one,
Would call their zeal and ardour overdone. 

But what her thought is--what her hope and stay
In moments of reflection, who shall say ?
--Time does not slacken, nay, he speeds his pace,
Bearing her onward to her finished race :
The common doom awaits her--'dust to dust ;'
The young may soon receive it, but she must. 
'Brighter and brighter to the perfect day !'
Oh ! does her earthly mind, her anxious heart,
Clinging to life, not longing to depart,
Her languid prayer, her graces dim and faint,
Meet that description of the growing saint ?
Let her inquire (for far is spent the night)
If she be meetened for that world of light :
Where are her fondest, best affections placed ?--
Death may improve but not reverse the taste :
Does she indeed the things of time prefer ?
Then surely Heaven could not be Heaven to her.

Are there not portions of the sacred word,
So often preached and quoted, read and heard,
That, though of deepest import, and designed
With joy or fear to penetrate the mind,
They pass away with notice cold and brief,
Like drops of rain upon a glossy leaf ?
--Such as the final sentence, on that day,
When all distinctions shall be done away,
But that the righteous Judge shall bring to light,
Between the left-hand millions, and the right ?
Here, in His word, in beams of light, it stands,
What will be then demanded at our hands ;
Clear and unclouded now the page appears,
As even then, illumed by blazing spheres.

--The question is not, if our earthly race
Was once enlightened by a flash of grace ;
If we sustained a place on Zion's hill,
What, if the stranger, sick and captive, lie
Naked and hungry, and we pass them by !
Or do but some extorted pittance throw,
To save our credit, not to ease their woe !
Or, strangers to the charity whence springs
The liberal heart, devising liberal things,
We, cumbered ever with our own pursuits,
To others leave the labour and its fruits ;
Pleading excuses for the crum we save,
For want of faith to cast it on the wave !
Enter His kingdom, reap the full reward ?
--Can such His good, His faithful servants be,
Blest of the Father ?--Read His word and see !

What, if in strange defiance of that rule,
Made not in Moses', but the Gospel school,
Shining as clearly as the light of Heaven,
'They who forgive not, shall not be forgiven,'
We live in anger, hatred, envy, strife,
Still firmly hoping for eternal life ;
The root of bitterness is left to grow ;
Resisting evil, indisposed to brook
A word of insult, or a scornful look ;
And speak the language of the world in all,
Except the challenge and the leaden ball !

What if, mistrustful of its latent worth,
We hide our single talent in the earth !
And what if self is pampered, not denied !
What if the flesh is never crucified !
What if the world be hidden in the heart,--
Will it be, 'Come, ye blessed !'--or, 'Depart ?'

Who then shall conquer ?--who maintain the fight ?
E'en they that walk by faith and not by sight :
Who having 'washed their robes and made them white,'
Press towards the mark, and see the promised land,
Not dim and distantly, but near at hand.
--We are but marching down a sloping hill,
Without a moment's time for standing still ;
Where every step accelerates the pace,
More and more rapid till we reach the base ;
And then, no clinging to the yielding dust !
An ocean rolls below, and plunge we must.
What plainer language labours to express,
Thus, metaphoric is employed to dress :
And this but serves on naked truth to throw
That hazy, indistinct, and distant glow,
Through which we wish the future to appear,--
Not as indeed it is,--true, awful, near.

And yet, amid the hurry, toil, and strife,
The claims, the urgencies, the whirl of life,--
The soul--perhaps in silence of the night--
Has flashes, transient intervals of light ;
When things to come, without a shade of doubt,
In terrible reality stand out.
Those lucid moments suddenly present
A glance of truth, as though the Heavens were rent ;
And through that chasm of pure celestial light,
The future breaks upon the startled sight :
Life's vain pursuits, and Time's advancing pace,
Appear with death-bed clearness, face to face ;
And Immortality's expanse sublime,
In just proportion to the speck of time :
While Death, uprising from the silent shades,
Shows his dark outline ere the vision fades ;
In strong relief against the blazing sky,
Appears the shadow as it passes by.
And though o'erwhelming to the dazzled brain,
These are the moments when the mind is sane.
For then, a hope of Heaven--the Savior's cross,
Seem what they are, and all things else but loss.
Oh ! to be ready--ready for that day,
Would we not give earth's fairest toys away
Alas ! how soon its interests cloud the view,
Rush in, and plunge us in the world anew !

Once Paul beheld, with more than mortal eye,
The unveiled glories of the upper sky :
And when descending from that vision's height,
(His faith and hope thenceforward turned to sight)
When he awoke and cast his eye anew,
Still aching, dazzled, wondering at the view,
On this dark world, how looked it ? mean and dim ;
And such it is, as then it seemed to him.
As when the eye a moment turns to gaze,
Adventurous, on the sun's meridian blaze,
The shining orb pursues whete'er it roves,
And hides in gloom the fields, the hills, the groves :
'Twas thus he saw the things that sense entice,
Fade in the glorious beam of Paradise ;
And felt how far eternal joys outweigh
The light afflictions of our fleeting day.
Well might he then press forward to the prize,
And every weight, and every woe despise !

Oh, with what pity would his bosom glow,
For this poor world, and those who walk below,
When fresh from glory--fraught with Heaven, he viewed
The busy, eager, earth-bound multitude !
Each groping where his loudest treasure lies ;
One at his farm, one at his merchandize :
To keep his doubtful spark of grace alive,
By formal service, paid one day in seven,
And brief, reluctant, misty thoughts of Heaven.
How he would weep, expostulate, and pray !
For he had seen--but there the verse must stay :
Paul could not utter--nor his pencil draw,
Yet, there it is--that glory that he saw :
Now, even now --whatever vain designs
Engross our worldly spirits--there it shines !
Oh ! place it not at time's remotest bounds
In doubtful distance, when the trump shall sound ;
Since what we hope for,--yes, and what we fear,
Is even near as death,--and death is near !
And where, from year to year, he prays and weeps ;
Whence, in the midnight watch, his thoughts arise
To those bright mansions where his treasure lies,--
How near it is to all his faith can see !
How short and peaceful may the passage be !
One beating pulse--one feeble struggle o'er,
May open wide the everlasting door.
Yes, for that bliss unspeakable, unseen,
Is ready--and the veil of flesh between
A gentle sigh may rend--and then display
The broad, full splendour of an endless day.
--This bright conviction elevates his mind ;
He presses forward, leaving all behind.--
Thus from his throne the tyrant foe is hurled,
--This is the faith that overcomes the world. 

PILGRIMS who journey in the narrow way,
Should go as little cumbered as they may.
'Tis heavy sailing with a freighted ship ;
'Tis pleasant travelling with a staff and scrip.
Gold clogs the path, dispose it how we will ;
Makes it fatiguing as we climb the hill :
And 'tis but here and there you may descry
The camel passing through the needle's eye.

'Love not the world ;'--most merciful decree
That makes its friendship enmity to Thee !
Some way to bliss through luxury and show ;
With gold and purple, in my coach and four ;
I dare not choose it--I would rather wait
A safer convoy at the rich man's gate.

See yonder modern mansion, light and fair,
Reared just beyond the taint of London air :
But not beyond, by many a dale and hill,
The taint of manners more unwholesome still.
Wide spreads in front the soft and sloping lawn,
With carriage roads in sweeping circles drawn :
The ample gardens, neat and well disposed,
Stretch far behind, by hectared walls enclosed ;
The shrubbery-walks in serpent windings run ;
The costly green-house blazes in the sun.
Rare fruits and flowers the gardener's skill employ,
More than the pampered owners can enjoy.
Within, a palace shines, superbly planned ;
No pains nor cost were spared to make it grand : 
Our thrifty merchants, fifty years ago,
Nor thought nor dreamed of such a stately show.
The bloated master stalks delighted thence,
Proud of the thing, more proud of the expense.

Here dwells an old professor in his nest,
With comely wife and dashing daughters blest ;
They, fresh from school, with all the native graces
They once possessed, quite polished off their faces ;
A trifling, useless, unharmonious train,
Accomplished, artificial, showy, vain ;
In all they do and say, and look and wear,
Aping the rank they were not born to bear :
And she, his help-meet, ever in her pride,
Teasing and pleading on the worldly side ;--
Such is his household, such, perchance, that he
Would blush to ask the Apostle Paul to tea.
--Not that the show and fashion of the place,
Itself, could certify the want of grace ;
(Though bounds there are, so wise and safe to keep,
But 'tis his soul retains the earthly leaven,
Would fain keep terms and compromise with Heaven ;
Striving, with pain, in Zion's paths to plod,
But keeping Mammon for his household god.

Thus live our merchant and his hopeful train,
Bound to the world, nor would they break the chain.
Its laws they own, its stamp and image bear,
There lies their portion, and their hearts are there.
Where then appears the faith they yet profess ?--
Not in their looks, their language, or their dress ;
But some cold forms remain, and some restraints,
To keep their name and place among the saints.
They never dance ; they never play at cards ;
One day in seven he duly still regards :
That tasty chapel, twice on Sabbath day,
Sees him and his set out in fair array.
And much they praise--the ladies and their sire,
The favourite preacher whom they all admire ;
Some soft, and sleek, and seraph-spoken boy,
The rabble's wonder and the ladies' toy ;
Snatched immature from academic bowers,
To dress up truth in artificial flowers.
Besides, our fair professor's name behold,
On neat Esquired committee-lists enrolled,
And long subscription-rows, that bring to light
Name, place, donation, and the annual mite ;
Duly proclaiming every right hand deed,
Trusting the left has never learnt to read.
A little gold, a morning or a day,
Spent in the cause, he freely gives away :
Perhaps, his pious zeal may even reach
The neat dimensions of an annual speech,
Gliding in well-turned compliments along,
The ladies too, his daughters, draw up rules
For lady-charities, and Sunday schools ;
Set down their names, their fair committees call ;
Busy and pleased, if they may manage all.
Meantime, the pious bustle, praised and told,
Has cost them nothing but their father's gold.

How customs and opinions change their place !
Religion, now, is scarcely in disgrace :
Her outward signs, at least, will even raise
Your credit high in these convenient days.
Fashion, herself, the cause of virtue pleads,
Becomes chief patroness of pious deeds,
And lets us e'en pursue, without restraint,
What once had stamped us puritan and saint. 
The good is done,--let fashion bear her part,
Motives are all in Heaven's impartial eye ;
But 'tis not ours to doubt and give the lie :
Let each grant credit to his neighbour's share,
But analyze his own with utmost care,--
That thus the scale is turned, the praise is due
To Him, who hears and owns the righteous few ;
Whose silent prayers and labours Heaven employs
To do the good, while others make the noise.

--'Tis trite to praise the country's green retreats,
Opposed to city smoke and noisy streets :
And scores of epithets, all ready strung,
That theme will furnish to be said or sung.
The limpid streamlet and the whispering breeze
Slip into rhyme with such spontaneous ease,
That he must be an humble scribe indeed,
Who could not write it--or who loves to read.
Trite though it be, it is a task I choose ;
A hackneyed theme befits an humble muse :
But leaving rills to ripple, woods to wave,
And birds to warble out the other stave,
I sing the choicest fruit of country air,
--The human plant that buds and blossoms there.

Happy the mother, who her train can rear
Far 'mid its breezy hills from year to year !
There healthful springs the body, and combined
With health, more precious, to the precious mind.
Not that there dwells a charm in country air,
Or chemic power, to bleach the Ethiop fair :
Romantic hope !--The poisonous breath of vice
Tainted the very airs of Paradise.
Sin spreads in every soil, in every gale ;
O'er-runs alike the mountain and the vale
But springs in cities, rank and noisome both,
Their foul and sultry vapour speeds its growth. '
Youth's sweetest grace, simplicity, is seen
Sporting with native smiles in meadows green,
In pleasant gardens, on the daisied ground,
Where simple joys, and few besides are found.
The knowing, forward, pert, and showy miss,
Springs rarely up in such a soil as this ;
For such a plant exotic, send us down
Some hot-house produce of the polished town.

The rage for competition, show, and style,
Is London's plague, and spreads for many a mile.
No rank, nor age, escapes that vulgar sin,
Breathed in its nurseries,--in its schools worked in :
And thus the mania, in maturer years,
In every form of pride and pomp appears,
As each were striving for a near approach--
Climax of grandeur !--to the lord mayor's coach.
--How short the triumph, many a prison cell,
And many a pining family could tell.--
The bridal equipage, in half a year
Brought to the hammer of the auctioneer,
Suffices not to liquidate the debt,
And fame's last bugle sounds in the Gazette. 

Regions of intellect ! serenely fair,
Hence let us rise, and breathe your purer air.
--There shine the stars ! one intellectual glance
At that bright host,--on yon sublime expanse,
Might prove a cure ;--well, say they, let them shine
With all our hearts,--but let us dress and dine.

There are, above the petty influence placed,
By human science and a mental taste.
The man who feels the dignity of thought,
By culture much refined, by science taught,
To loved pursuits devoted, looks below,
With true contempt upon the paltry show :
Compared with those in pleasure's vortex hurled,
He loves it not, and lives above the world.

But happier he who views the toys of time
From loftier heights, from regions more sublime ;
His hopes still climbing to a brighter sphere.
--Is he of wealth and earthly good possessed ?
He takes Heaven's bounty with a cheerful zest.
His quarrel with the world you might not note
From texture, cut, or colour of his coat ;
For studied plainness, whether dress or speech,
Defeats the very end it aims to reach.
And yet, on all he has there stands imprest
One truth conspicuous--' This is not my rest.'--
From that divine remembrance ever springs
A moderated care for other things :
--Pilgrim and stranger in a desert spot,
He holds them all as though he held them not.

Peace, order, comfort, in his household reign ;
And more than these he seeks not to obtain.
His mansion, furnished in no costly style,
Oft makes his tasty neighbours stare and smile ;
But that unmoved and unavenged he bears,
Unless it be, sometimes, to smile at theirs.
His neat, plain parlour wants our modern air,
But comfort smiles on every object there.
--Tables of costly wood, and chairs whose mould
Bespeaks the fashion not a fortnight old,
The window drapery's elegant costume, 
Arranged and deeply fringed to match the room,
Carpets, where eastern patterns richly crawl,
Vases, and mirrors blazing on the wall,
Cupids that wave their waxen flames in air,
Sideboards of plate, cut-glass, and china rare,--
These things he sees, and Oh ! surprising phlegm !
Wastes not a thought nor wish for one of them.
Still more surprising, that his house and board
Are plainer far than he could well afford !
No seasoned dainties on his table steal ;
Frugal, though ample, is the daily meal.
The 'olive plants' in graceful order sit ;
No greedy hands implore the savoury bit ;
Taught from the very cradle to despise
The wish for more than hunger's claim supplies.
A pampered body, and a vigorous mind,
Are things, he deems, that cannot be combined ;
And aiming thus the mental string to brace,
He rears a hardy, independent race.

His girls, a blooming train, their home adorn ;
Simply attired, and cheerful as the morn :
Industrious, active, frugal, like their sire ;
Trained to resist each frivolous desire ;
To scorn the trifles that the sex pursues,
And rise superior to its petty views.
Slightly accomplished, but their minds are fraught
With taste and knowledge, and inured to thought.
Year after year, four precious hours a day,
Is deemed by him too dear a price to pay
E'en for that art, which all the world reveres,
Up from the tradesman's daughter to the peer's.
Yet not with narrow, much mistaken view,
Would he deny them mental culture too ;
Though vulgar zealots love to state the case,
That human learning is a foe to grace ;
And rear their ill-bred, rude, illiterate youth,
To loathe their shackles, and despise the truth.

Religion here, in all her native grace,
Shines out serene in every heart and face ;
Nor e'er is banished, though pursuits may claim
Attention oft, that do not bear her name.
Thus he adorns the doctrine he avows ;
And while it prospers, that memorial word,--
'The poor are always with you,' still is heard.
The hungry throng that crowd his open gate
Not there, like Lazarus, unregarded wait ;
Since each expensive pleasure is denied,
Which, while it starves the needy, pampers pride.
Many condemn his plan, and many deem
He carries things to an absurd extreme ;
Think he might live in style, and yet afford
A decent crum from his superfluous board :
--Still there were other poor, and still the sums
That style would cost might furnish other crums.
'Tis thus he argues, thus that order reads,
'Sell all thou hast, and give to him that needs.'
At that hard saying, many turn away ;
Let him who can, receive it, and obey.

Oh, for a soul magnanimous, to know,
Poor world, thy littleness, and let thee go !
Not with a gloomy, proud, ascetic mind,
That loves thee still, and only hates mankind ;
Reverse the line, and that my temper be,
--To love mankind, and pour contempt on thee


The world is a beautiful place
to be born into
if you don't mind happiness
not always being
so very much fun
if you don't mind a touch of hell
now and then
just when everything is fine
because even in heaven
they don't sing
all the time

The world is a beautiful place
to be born into
if you don't mind some people dying
all the time
or maybe only starving
some of the time
which isn't half bad
if it isn't you

Oh the world is a beautiful place
to be born into
if you don't much mind
a few dead minds
in the higher places
or a bomb or two
now and then
in your upturned faces
or such other improprieties
as our Name Brand society
is prey to
with its men of distinction
and its men of extinction
and its priests
and other patrolmen

and its various segregations
and congressional investigations
and other constipations
that our fool flesh
is heir to

Yes the world is the best place of all
for a lot of such things as 
making the fun scene
and making the love scene
and making the sad scene
and singing low songs and having inspirations
and walking around
looking at everything
and smelling flowers
and goosing statues
and even thinking
and kissing people and
making babies and wearing pants
and waving hats and
dancing
and going swimming in rivers
on picnics
in the middle of the summer
and just generally
'living it up' 
Yes
but then right in the middle of it 
comes the smiling

mortician


I perceive the world as a playground
Where dawn and dusk appear in eternal rounds
In His Universal form is a plaything the throne of Solomon
The miracles of the Messiah seem so ordinary in my eyes
Without name I cannot comprehend any form
Illusionary but is the identity of all objects
My anguish envelopes the entire desert
Silently flows the river in front of my floods
Ask not what separation has done to me
Just see your poise when I come in front of you
Truly you say that I am egotistical and proud
It is the reflection, O friend, in your limited mirror
To appreciate the style and charm of conversation
Just bring in the goblet and wine
Hatred manifests due to my envious mind
Thus I say, don't take his name in front of me
Faith stops me while temptations attract
Inspite of Kaaba behind and church ahead
I am the Lover, yet notorious is my charm
Thus Laila calls names to Majnu in front of me
'Dies' not one though the union is a delight
In premonition of the separation night
Alas, this be it, the bloody separation wave
I know not what else is in store ahead of me
Though the hands don't move, the eyes are alive
Wine and goblet, let them stay in front of me
Says 'Ghalib' 
Conscience is companion and trusted friend
Don't pass any judgments in front of me. 


The World is crying, 
crying for the tears
of the Rainforest

She hears her screams
but has no hands
to hold her tight

The World is crying, 
crying for the hands
she knows we own


The World is crying



No boundary is too vast for my imagination.
Everything I hope and dream is within my grasp -
I have but to reach out and take what is mine.
Within the confines of my mind lie infinite possibilities -
Nothing is too complex for my inquisitive nature.
First the thought, then the word, then the act
Manifests all that I desire if only I release the fear
That holds me back and threatens to limit me.
I am the creator of my reality, and all that I know -
I live what I create and attract what I think to me.
Life is an adventure - an experience of unlimited range -
Nothing is too difficult to accomplish with imagination.
I can be whatever or whomever I choose to be -
My existance is not limited by my surroundings
Nor by the physical aspects of my body and mind.
I am a spark of the Divine energy of the universe -
I am one with the Source of all creation and all mankind.
The world is my toy, and I am the player -
The game of life is  the most precious gift I will ever receive. 

The world is too much with us; late and soon,
     Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
     Little we see in Nature that is ours;
     We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
     This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
     The winds that will be howling at all hours,
     And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
     For this, for everything, we are out of tune,
     A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
     So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,
     Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
     Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
     Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn. 

Just because 
they don't shoot you in the Head
It doesn't mean to say
that they don't kill you

They spin you
into a world of nothingness
In the race to power and greed


Kamran! 
No doubt should creep in your mind
No more illusionary dreams
No more delusional prophecies
No more third person hallucinations
No more abstracted realities
No more forbidden desires
No more love and lust
For false beauties and volatile wealth
No more hidden truth
Your tongue should speak
No more excruciating pain
Your soul should endure
No more
I plead
No more

You have been misjudged
Mistaken and mishandled
Why? 
How? 
Whatever-
You must not care
For these superficial minds
And shallow souls

You must not burn
The world of your inner true self
In the hell of impotent hearts
And
In the fire of heavenly desires
The world of yours
Would always remain yours
If you would not let anyone
Come closer to its boundary wall


In the mist of the night gone 
And the thick of the last dawn
Wondering about destiny and the sky 
In the world of the spirit, I found the way to fly
To unlock the mystery of the blue dome and mine
Then feel content to rest the curious soul
Then in the mind all will be well 
When life is filled with jewels of deeds
To be at its best and to forget the needs
That will take the pain of life, then joy will increase
The game of man is the choice of life to become
That makes us march on, until the end will come
The choice will never let man be released
Or let the game change or be far away at least
By destiny and fear of faith in what the soul with face
The sky without stands knows why we live to climb
Not by choice, not by will, we are destined by destiny and time
Until we rest and dwell in heaven
But for the breeds of the dark to sleep in hell ﻿My love the season for the sake of season continued to change.
But loved me never i'the subtitute and the world also knew how i'loved you*

My love water continued to irrigate the river, and never stopped during still had the life.
Even so the feeling of my love never stopped for me living for you.
And the world also knew how i'loved you*

My love as long as the autumn made fell the leaves you will see that loving me never fell for you.
And the world also knew how i'loved you*

My love you saw the sun illuminated the world and never felt tired.
See my love as the sun was so strong illuminated your heart.
And the world also knew how i'loved you*

You knew how the moon made beautiful dark him the night? 
In spite of that loved me will make doviously in the dark road your night.
And the world also knew how i'loved you


THE WORM AND THE ANGLER
They (the fish)  are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able.- 

When you picked me up from the dirt
I writhed and tried to wriggle out
For my life.
I felt the vile heart that throbbed
On the ugly fingers that held me-
Your heart! 
It was dirtier than the dirt I lived in
Fouler than the fowl-beaks
I escaped till day
Crueler than the crow-beaks 
That would feed on my flesh.

Not even in my dreams 
Had I seen a hook
Much less, one that would impale me, 
For, none who ascended the cross, nay, hook
Came back to tell the tale of the crooks.
Life is just another tale
By another name! 

My slightly flesh
Would not your hunger sate
So I am here on the hook a bait
For the fish to come and bite.
I would attract only smaller fry
Bigger sharks need better baits.

The fish that would swallow me 
And end up on your dining table 
Knows quite well that
I do not belong to its waters
And its regular food
But never guess I am a bait
May not notice the hook, the line
And the vile hands holding control.
It would be too late
When the sharpness of the hook
Meets its flesh
And pulls it out 
Of its own waters
Writhing, gasping for a wisp of air
In the abundant air
That would snatch its life away.

In the excruciating pain	
And the suffocating full open air
It would definitely forget
To curse you, the line and the hook.
But the curse on me
Is for generations to come.

Its guts you remove
Would include my little flesh
May be still alive
Would feed the crows and the fowl.
But they would never know 
My bleeding heart, life impaled
Your forked tongue
And crooked fangs.
Life is just another game
By another name

So steep, so deep, and yet so painful
The tears are crystallized
I just realized
That the marbles won’t melt under the full
Rays of the midday sun.
Daughter and son
Should not stab the heart 
Of the patriarch.
To save our soul.
The event is too hurtful
To bear.
This is a slap in our face, 
This is a bad shot in our sibling’s brace.
Let me breathe the air
Of a new season.
Let the sun shine.
Let it rain on the brave pine.
There is a reason for everything, 
A betrayal for spring, 
A shame for winter, 
A backstabbing for summer, 
And an odium for fall.
Things will change for all.
This is a new dawn.
The cats have littered the lawn.
There is a foul smell in the room.
Bring the broom, 
Bring the mop.
This a low blow, 
This is a bad show.
Do not forget to pop
The questions.
There are no reasons
Left in the chaotic gala.
This is a fiasco, a drama, 
A trauma. That’s not love
From the dreaming man above.
The tears will not melt away.
The pain is too deep, too steep.
The dogs cannot sleep; 
The butterfly refuses to play.
So steep, so stiff, and yet so hurtful.
The heart is strong, heavy, and full. 

Stupidity and Selfishness and Fear,
Who hold enslaved the intellect of Man,
Have found their victims here.

We saw them go, alert to seek the van
Where phantom Glory showered her withering leaves;
Now they return who can.

Slowly, full-fraught with pain, the vessel heaves
From labouring seas, and creeps along the bay
To where the city grieves.

Happy are those who limp the dusty way;
And those whose eyes can meet the loving glance,
Happy indeed are they.

But mock them not with babble of romance:
They have glared at death across the orient rocks
Or in the mire of France.

O welcome to your land of herds and flocks
And fields that pray toward a fairy sky
That promises and mocks.

Welcome! our eyes are strained and sorrow-dry,
Watching for peace and you, and every heart
Would fain, but cannot, cry.

For you who, led by love, have borne your part
Where war's black ploughshare turns the bloody sand
And crops of hatred start

For you and by your help, heroic band,
We swear by love and labour to make this
A lovelier, worthier land.

Nor shall we let the home-bred serpent hiss
Unscotched upon our hearth, if ever here
Our hope and fortune kiss.

The workers of the battered world draw near,
Scorning a foeman's name. The heart of Man
In every land is dear. 

The wounded statues
of Athena's city
anticipate  spring's healing herbs
to cure  anger's hurts.
Unprotestingly they accepted anger's bullets, 
bricks, marbles, paints. 
They should pay off the losses
caused to innocents by a winter so prolonged.
Why stay imperiously on their pedestals? 
Reason to be suspected of in conspiracies enfolding. 
They stood there callously, 
when frozen people confronted winter's severe attack! 
To show that things run on the right track? 
Ah, they would not allow statues to favour
the opponent's side
even if only insisting on their own nonchalance.
Faced by demonstrators in gleeful acclamation 
they must take sides with them
or else be laughed by them to scorn, 
be in scarecrows transformed.

The consequences of their indifference should be paid for.
It is unacceptable people to stare at them astound; 
it means treachery and disorientation.
Eyes have to shed bitter tears
when confronting winter's savage assault, 
this is no time for artistic indulgence.
Waiting neutral for the Spring to come
won't allay  heavy winter's suffering.
Statues have to participate in popular struggle.
Art's primal duty is people's expectation to serve
and statues must to  the wintry plight  respond! 
Oh, Yes.
Would they let the statues  aloof

The wounded wilderness of Morris Graves
is not the same wild west
the white man found
It is a land that Buddha came upon
from a different direction
It is a wild white nest
in the true mad north
of introspection
where 'falcons of the inner eye'
dive and die
glimpsing in their dying fall
all life's memory
of existence
and with grave chalk wing
draw upon the leaded sky
a thousand threaded images
of flight

It is the night that is their 'native habitat'
these 'spirit birds' with bled white wings
these droves of plover
bearded eagles
blind birds singing
in glass fields
these moonmad swans and ecstatic ganders
trapped egrets
charcoal owls
trotting turtle symbols
these pink fish among mountains
shrikes seeking to nest
whitebone drones
mating in air
among hallucinary moons

And a masked bird fishing
in a golden stream and an ibis feeding
~on its own breast'
and a stray Connemara Pooka'
(life size)
And then those blown mute birds
bearing fish and paper messages
between two streams
which are the twin streams
of oblivion
wherein the imagination
turning upon itself
with white electric vision
refinds itself still mad
and unfed
among the hebrides


OCTOBER! tho' thy rugged brow,
No vivid wreaths entwine;
Tho' not for thee the zephyr blow,
Tho' not for thee the blossom glow,
Or skies unclouded shine:

Tho' o'er thy dark and russet vest
No rainbow-colors play;
Tho' dim thine eye, tho' cold thy breast,
Yet be thou honor'd, be thou blest,
E'en more than youthful May!

No vernal suns illume thy day,
Fair star of joy! then brighter beam!
No forest-notes attend thy way,
Then strike the lyre, then make the lay,
To one inspiring theme!

Thy steps may blight the roseate plain,
Thy winds may chill the vale;
Yet, blooming 'midst thy shadowy train,
One radiant morn adorns thy reign; 
Hail! dark October! hail!

Thine is the day, to Britons dear,
That bids fair Albion dry the tear;
With myrtles wreath her victor-spear,
And ev'ry grief disown.
Oh! let a people's voice prolong,
Proud Loyalty's triumphal song;
And faith, and truth, and valor, throng
Around Britannia's throne!

That still their monarch's heart may feel
How sweet affections grateful zeal
Still kindle with the patriot flame,
And 'glory in a Briton's name!'
O name! by deeds emblazon'd high,
O name! exalted to the sky,
O name! ennobled by the free!
Thou sacred sovereign! worthy thee!

Then wake, fairest Albion! awake to rejoice,
To the Paean of rapture attuning thy voice,
And suspending thy war-song awhile!
Thou hast mourn'd for the great, thou hast wept o'er the brave,
Thou hast bent in despair o'er the Patriot's grave;
But now from thy bosom repressing the sigh,
Dispelling the tear from thy sun-darting eye,
Let ecstacy dawn in thy smile!

Yet the storm is around thee, the hurricane roars;
But Freedom and Loyalty dwell on thy shores,
Defending a Monarch ador'd!

They are true, they are dauntless, their bosoms are mail;
In vain may Ambition their fortress assail;
And bright is their streamer that plays on the breeze
And crimsons the wave, as it floats o'er the seas,
And keen is their fire-flashing sword!
Thy oak shall be firm till the tempest is past;
Majestic it rises, disdaining the blast,
It is proud, independent, supreme!
The nations around thee are cheerless in night,
And hope has extinguished her quivering light!
But the sun-beam of heaven on thy bosom shall rest, 
And the planet of freedom be bright in the west,
Where its ray shall eternally stream!

Thou art like the fair vales, with exuberance crown'd,
Embosom'd in Appenines, cheerless around,
Where dwells Desolation alone!
Thou art like the proud laurel, still blooming and green,
When verdure and life have deserted the scene:

Thou art like a tall column, unmoulder'd by time,
That rises 'midst ruins, imperial, sublime,
So firm is thy rock-pillar'd throne!

Yet the storm is around thee, the hurricane roars;
But valor and loyalty dwell on thy shores,
And long may the guardians remain!
Firm, ardent, intrepid, oh! long may they stand,
The sabre of justice and truth in their hand:
Then the fire-flag of rapine may blaze thro' the air,
The torch of invasion, a comet, may glare,
And the war-tempest threaten—in vain!

O Monarch of Albion! ador'd by the free!
What Briton but worships your name?
And where is the spirit that burns not with pride,
For a country to freedom, to glory allied?
And who would not kindle, exulting in death,
And triumph, and glow, in resigning his breath,
For a King, for a land, so exalted in fame?

Yes! ye bands of noble fire,
Dauntless on the plain!
Ye, who firm, in danger try'd,
Thought on England ere ye died,
Mingling blood with Tajo's tide;
Ye, whose memory shall inspire,
Many a bard and many a lyre,
Songs of Spain.

Heroes of Corunna's field!
Ye, who perish'd there,
Be your names for ever dear!
Yes! tho' dew'd with many a tear,
Yet triumphal was your bier!
Who like you the sword could wield?
Deathless trophies grace your shield,
Bright and fair!

Ye, who purchas'd, ere ye fell,
Talavera's crown!

Sainted spirits of the brave,
Lo! immortal o'er your grave,
Glory's amaranth shall wave!
Who your gallant deeds may tell?
Who may ring your thrilling knell?
High renown!

Faithful friends, who mourn sincere,
Where the brave repose;
Cold and low the mighty sleep.
Yes! ye well may sadly weep,
Well desponding vigils keep!
Yet shall kindling pride be near,
Yet shall triumph gild the tear
Love bestows!

By the patriot's holy flame,
Of transcendent rays;
Lyre! by thy sublimest chord,
Freedom! by thy shrine ador'd,
Honor! by thy radiant sword,

O'er the heroes lofty name,
Shall the noon-tide sun of fame
Deathless blaze!

Then let thy tear, O Albion! Shed
Its dew-balm o'er the valiant dead,
(A tear so sad, and yet so proud!)
But let the smile thine eye illume,
But let thy cheek the smile resume,
As the bright rainbow's vivid bloom
Streams o'er the parting cloud!

And form, thy sovereign's brow to shade,
A diadem that shall not fade,
A wreath, of glow eternal!
And there the British oak may shine,
And there let Mercy's palm entwine,
And Science there her bays combine,
That ever shall be vernal!

And come! ye forms of towering mien,
In graceful dignity serene;
Ye fearless guardians of the state,
Superior to the storms of fate!
And round the British throne attending,
Its arms, its fame, its cause defending;
There, firm in faith, united stand,
Invincible, immortal band!
Thou, Freedom! with the lightning-eye,
Be there! unfurl thy flag on high,
And all thy mounting soul impart!
And bid thy living flame expand,
Warm, bright, ethereal, o'er the land.—
Rise, Freedom! rise, with all thy fires,
When Britain's throne thine aid requires
Come! in thy proud, refulgent car,
Whose beam is Albion's guiding star;

And wave that sabre, dazzling bright,
Pure, hallow'd, spotless, as the light;
Whose ray for us a sun-beam glows,
Whose flash is lightning on our foes!
Be near, majestic maid! be near,
Hope in thine eye and justice on thy spear!

And thou, Fidelity! thou angel-form,
True in the combat, stedfast in the storm;
Whose truth shall beam, celestial, constant, pure,
And 'midst the fiery ordeal, smile secure;
Thou! with a cincture of Asbestos wove,
Seraph, be there! impart thy sacred aid,
Be there! Britannia's glowing soul pervade!
Unite each heart by thy unchanging laws,
Firm, loyal, bold, in one transcendent cause!

Valor! thou, whose burning soul,
Kindles, mounts, beyond control;

Thou! whose ardor death defies;
Rushing to th' immortal prize;
Monarch of the conquering spear,
Dauntless on thy proud career;
Stern defiance on thy crest,
Melting mercy in thy breast;
Thou! with arms emblazon'd fair,
King of Danger!—be thou there!
Bid thy votaries round thee throng,
Wake thy boldest martial song!
Sing in proud, triumphant lay,
Agincourt's victorious day!
Sing the chief of Acre's fame,
Sing of Maida's brilliant name!
Sing Vimeira's high renown,
Talavera's recent crown!
Be thou there! With kindling eye,
Peril, toil, and foes defy;
Raise thy beamy falchion high,
Wave thy banner to the sky!

Sound thy clarion thro' the air,
Bid thy ardent sons be there!
Be their watch-word in the fight,
'Brunswick and Albion! Liberty and Right!!!'

With thee be Fortitude, whose awful mien,
Tow'rs in the blast, collected and serene!
Fate's wint'ry blast, affliction's mountain-waves;
Thy lofty heart, secure in ten-fold mail, 
Misfortune's arrows may in vain assail!
'Tis thine unchang'd, to meet, with proud disdain,
The spectre-forms of danger and of pain!
In glory's track undaunted to proceed,
To smile and suffer—to exult—and bleed!
Derive new spirit from the tempest rude,
And rise august—exalted—unsubdu'd!
And thou, fair Loyalty! be still enshrin'd


In every manly heart, each-patriot-mind:

Lo! in Religion's fane I see thee bend,
I hear thy prayer on fervor's wing ascend!
(While the warm tear-drop glitters on thy cheek,
While faith and hope thy melting eyes bespeak.)
'Sovereign of kings! whose high decree
Controls the storm, subdues the sea!
Who giv'st thy scourge Ambition, pow'r
To spread dismay, his destin'd hour;
To win his blood-stain'd, regal prize,
To reign, to ravage, to chastise;
Look down! on him in mercy smile, 
The Monarch of the favor'd Isle!
Undimm'd, unclouded by regret,
May his mild star in glory set!
And peace and joy, with softest ray,
Illume his calm declining day!
Oh! long extend his hallow'd reign,
Oh! long his throne august, maintain!

And when, a mourner o'er his bier,
Sad Albion pours the filial tear;
Around may guardian-seraphs wait,
And waft him to a happier state;
Conduct him to a brighter throne,
A realm of peace, a fairer crown;
Enrich'd with many a spotless gem,
Virtue's illustrious diadem!

       So long you stay on shore.

'Twas on the t of April, and in the year of Eighteen thirteen,
That the whaler "Oscar" was wrecked not far from Aberdeen;
'Twas all on a sudden the wind arose, and a terrific blast it blew,
And the "Oscar" was lost, and forty-two of a gallant crew. 



The storm burst forth with great violence, but of short duration,
And spread o'er a wide district, and filled the people's hearts with consternation,
And its effects were such that the people will long mind,
Because at Peterhead the roof was torn off a church by the heavy wind. 

The "Oscar" joined other four ships that were lying in Aberdeen Bay,
All ready to start for Geeenland without delay,
While the hearts of each ship's crew felt light and gay,
But, when the storm burst upon them, it filled their hearts with dismay. 

The wind had been blowing westerly during the night,
But suddenly it shifted to the North-east, and blew with all its might,
And thick and fast fell the blinding snow,
Which filled the poor sailors' hearts with woe. 

And the "Oscar" was exposed to the full force of the gale,
But the crew resolved to do their best, allowing they should fail,
So they weighed anchor, and stood boldly out for sea,
While the great crowds that had gathered cheered them encouragingly. 

The ill-fated "Oscar," however, sent a boat ashore
For some of her crew that were absent, while the angry sea did roar,
And 'twas with great difficulty the men got aboard,
And to make the ship allright they wrought with one accord. 

Then suddenly the wind shifted, and a treacherous calm ensued,
And the vessel's deck with snow was thickly strewed;
And a heavy sea was running with a strong flood tide,
And it soon became apparent the men wouldn't be able the ship to guide. 

And as the "Oscar" drifted further and further to leeward,
The brave crew tried hard her backward drifting to retard,
But all their efforts proved in vain, for the storm broke out anew,
While the drifting snow hid her from the spectators' view. 

And the position of the "Oscar" was critical in the extreme,
And as the spray washed o'er the vessel, O what a soul-harrowing scene!
And notwithstanding the fury of the gale and the blinding snow,
Great crowds watched the "Oscar" as she was tossed to and fro. 

O heaven! it was a most heart-rending sight
To see the crew struggling against the wind and blinding snow with all their might,
While the mighty waves lashed her sides and angry did roar,
Which to their relatives were painful to see that were standing on shore. 

All eagerly watching her attempt to ride out the storm,
Especially their friends and relatives, who seemed very forlorn,
Because the scene was awe-inspiring and made them stand aghast,
For every moment seemed to be the "Oscar's" last. 

Oh! it was horrible to see the good ship in distress,
Battling hard against wind and tide to clear the Girdleness.
A conspicuous promontory on the south side of Aberdeen Bay,
Where many a stout ship and crew have gone down passing that way. 

At last the vessel was driven ashore in the bay of Greyhope,
And the "Oscar" with the elements no longer could cope.
While the big waves lashed her furiously, and she received fearful shocks,
Until a mighty wave hurled her among large boulders of rocks. 

And when the vessel struck, the crew stood aghast,
But they resolved to hew down the mainmast,
Which the spectators watched with eager interest,
And to make it fall on the rocks the brave sailors tried their best. 

But, instead of falling on the rocks, it dropped into the angry tide,
Then a groan arose from those that were standing on the shore side;
And the mainmast in its fall brought down the foremast,
Then all hope of saving the crew seemed gone at last. 

And a number of the crew were thrown into the boiling surge below,
While loud and angry the stormy wind did blow,
And the good ship was dashed to pieces from stern to stem,
Within a yard or two from their friends, who were powerless to save them. 

Oh! it was an appalling sight to see the "Oscar" in distress,
While to the forecastle was seen clinging brave Captain Innes
And five of a crew, crying for help, which none could afford,

For the ship and men sank beneath the briny main,
And out of a crew of forty-four men, only two were saved,
But, landsmen, think how manfully that unfortunate crew behaved. 

And also think of the mariners while you lie down to sleep,
For their hardships are many, and hard to endure,
There's only a plank between them and a watery grave, which makes their lives unsure. 

In her room at the prow of the house
Where light breaks, and the windows are tossed with linden,
My daughter is writing a story.

I pause in the stairwell, hearing
From her shut door a commotion of typewriter-keys
Like a chain hauled over a gunwale.

Young as she is, the stuff
Of her life is a great cargo, and some of it heavy:
I wish her a lucky passage.

But now it is she who pauses,
As if to reject my thought and its easy figure.
A stillness greatens, in which

The whole house seems to be thinking,
And then she is at it again with a bunched clamor
Of strokes, and again is silent.

I remember the dazed starling
Which was trapped in that very room, two years ago;
How we stole in, lifted a sash

And retreated, not to affright it;
And how for a helpless hour, through the crack of the door,
We watched the sleek, wild, dark

And iridescent creature
Batter against the brilliance, drop like a glove
To the hard floor, or the desk-top,

And wait then, humped and bloody,
For the wits to try it again; and how our spirits
Rose when, suddenly sure,

It lifted off from a chair-back, 
Beating a smooth course for the right window
And clearing the sill of the world.

It is always a matter, my darling,
Of life or death, as I had forgotten. I wish
What I wished you before, but harder. 



Anxious from the scent of dusk
The writing spider smells his bread
A net he sews into the wind
With seductive silky thread

Stationed closely to the light, 
Which is his opened mind
Shooting stars are caught then spun
In metaphoric rhyme 

Each web has its tale to tell
Moths are gathering to his feet
The sky, it is his paper
And now they are his ink

And when the night has come and gone
His web is dressed in sparkling dew
And scribbled in the middle
Is a poem he's left for you


contend in a sea which the land partly encloses
shielding them from the too-heavy blows
of an ungoverned ocean which when it chooses

tortures the biggest hulls, the best man knows
to pit against its beatings, and sinks them pitilessly.
Mothlike in mists, scintillant in the minute

brilliance of cloudless days, with broad bellying sails
they glide to the wind tossing green water
from their sharp prows while over them the crew crawls

ant-like, solicitously grooming them, releasing,
making fast as they turn, lean far over and having
caught the wind again, side by side, head for the mark.

In a well guarded arena of open water surrounded by
lesser and greater craft which, sycophant, lumbering
and flittering follow them, they appear youthful, rare

as the light of a happy eye, live with the grace
of all that in the mind is feckless, free and
naturally to be desired. Now the sea which holds them

is moody, lapping their glossy sides, as if feeling
for some slightest flaw but fails completely.
Today no race. Then the wind comes again. The yachts

move, jockeying for a start, the signal is set and they
are off. Now the waves strike at them but they are too
well made, they slip through, though they take in canvas.

Arms with hands grasping seek to clutch at the prows.
Bodies thrown recklessly in the way are cut aside.
It is a sea of faces about them in agony, in despair

until the horror of the race dawns staggering the mind;
the whole sea become an entanglement of watery bodies
lost to the world bearing what they cannot hold. Broken,

beaten, desolate, reaching from the dead to be taken up
they cry out, failing, failing! their cries rising
in waves still as the skillful yachts pass over.


'Twas on the shores that round our coast
From Deal to Ramsgate span,
That I found alone on a piece of stone
An elderly naval man.

His hair was weedy, his beard was long,
And weedy and long was he,
And I heard this wight on the shore recite,
In a singular minor key:

"Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,
And the mate of the NANCY brig,
And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,
And the crew of the captain's gig


And he shook his fists and he tore his hair,
Till I really felt afraid,
For I couldn't help thinking the man had been drinking,
And so I simply said:

"Oh, elderly man, it's little I know
Of the duties of men of the sea,
And I'll eat my hand if I understand
However you can be

"At once a cook, and a captain bold,
And the mate of the NANCY brig,
And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,
And the crew of the captain's gig


Then he gave a hitch to his trousers, which


And having got rid of a thumping quid,
He spun this painful yarn:

"'Twas in the good ship NANCY BELL
That we sailed to the Indian Sea,
And there on a reef we come to grief,
Which has often occurred to me.

"And pretty nigh all the crew was drowned
(There was seventy-seven o' soul),
And only ten of the NANCY'S men
Said 'Here!' to the muster-roll.

"There was me and the cook and the captain bold,
And the mate of the NANCY brig,
And the bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,
And the crew of the captain's gig.

"For a month we'd neither wittles nor drink,
Till a-hungry we did feel,
So we drawed a lot, and, accordin' shot
The captain for our meal.

"The next lot fell to the NANCY'S mate,
And a delicate dish he made;
Then our appetite with the midshipmite
We seven survivors stayed.

"And then we murdered the bo'sun tight,
And he much resembled pig;
Then we wittled free, did the cook and me,
On the crew of the captain's gig.

"Then only the cook and me was left,
And the delicate question, 'Which
Of us two goes to the kettle?' arose,
And we argued it out as sich.

"For I loved that cook as a brother, I did,
And the cook he worshipped me;
But we'd both be blowed if we'd either be stowed
In the other chap's hold, you see.

"'I'll be eat if you dines off me,' says TOM;
'Yes, that,' says I, 'you'll be, -
'I'm boiled if I die, my friend,' quoth I;
And 'Exactly so,' quoth he.

"Says he, 'Dear JAMES, to murder me
Were a foolish thing to do,
For don't you see that you can't cook ME,
While I can - and will - cook YOU!'

"So he boils the water, and takes the salt
And the pepper in portions true
(Which he never forgot), and some chopped shalot.
And some sage and parsley too.

"'Come here,' says he, with a proper pride,
Which his smiling features tell,
''T will soothing be if I let you see
How extremely nice you'll smell.'

"And he stirred it round and round and round,
And he sniffed at the foaming froth;
When I ups with his heels, and smothers his squeals
In the scum of the boiling broth.

"And I eat that cook in a week or less,
And - as I eating be
The last of his chops, why, I almost drops,
For a wessel in sight I see!

 

"And I never larf, and I never smile,
And I never lark nor play,
But sit and croak, and a single joke
I have - which is to say:

"Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,
And the mate of the NANCY brig,
And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,
And the crew of the captain's gig!'"I 

A storm of white petals, 
Buds throwing open baby fists 
Into hands of broad flowers. 

II 

Red roses running upward, 
Clambering to the clutches of life 
Soaked in crimson. 

III 

Rabbles of tattered leaves 
Holding golden flimsy hopes 
Against the tramplings 
Into the pits and gullies. 

IV 

Hoarfrost and silence: 
Only the muffling 
Of winds dark and lonesome-- 
Great lullabies to the long sleepers. 

The year just started; 
Yet, it is almost over.
Today is the second day of the year; 
Yet, it is with anger, 
Fear, impatience, and horror
That we want another year
To show up at our door.

Give ourselves a chance.
Before we dance, 
Let's pray first, 
And stop the frivolous lust.
Let's quench our thirst, 
So we can enjoy the party, 
And be more relaxed and happy.

What's wrong with human beings? 
We refuse to take it slow. Things
Should not be happening like that.
Of course, we're going to be fat, 
And ugly, if we're not being careful.
'Cause we gobble everything down in full
Force, like gluttons, like fools in the pool.

Take things easy, little by little, 
Step by step, stop being frugal.
A year just ended; 
Yet, it is with anger, 
Fear, impatience, and horror
That we want another one to start; 
Please chill out and have a heart.


To-night I close my eyes and see
A strange procession passing me--
The years before I saw your face
Go by me with a wistful grace;
They pass, the sensitive, shy years,
As one who strives to dance, half blind with tears.

The years went by and never knew
That each one brought me nearer you;
Their path was narrow and apart
And yet it led me to your heart--
Oh, sensitive, shy years, oh, lonely years,
That strove to sing with voices drowned in tears. 


THE YELLOW ROOM 
(for Bryan)   

I want to go 
& live in 

Bryan's room 
even though it doesn't exist 

except 
on canvas. 

I walk in through the door 
of his imagination. 

Close this reality behind me 
& sit still.  

very still. 

If you should look 
(you won't see me)    

for I will have always just left 
& gone into the room beyond 

or sat on the window ledge 
just out of reach of the canvas. 

I will always be 
somewhere in THE YELLOW ROOM 

there 
even when 

I am 

(not there) . 




INSIDE.  

THE YELLOW ROOM 

Inside its yellow 
room 

the giant blue amoeba alien 
sits patiently & waits 

to transform itself into 
the absurd 

two legged 
creatures. 

It’s DNA sequence 
floats around inside 

bouncing off the walls 
of its cell. 

An eye has appeared 
as a little bit of cloud 

but as yet 
sees nothing. 

It has grown legs 
like a table 

but the human form 
is proving difficult to master. 

When the CIA 
stormed the place 

it successfully 
passed itself off 

as a table. 

Now it takes the form 
of a poet 
(one Donall Dempsey)    

not realising just what 
a bad move this is! 



When beechen buds begin to swell, 
And woods the blue-bird's warble know, 
The yellow violet's modest bell 
Peeps from last-year's leaves below.

Ere russet fields their green resume, 
Sweet flower, I love, in forest bare, 
To meet thee, when thy faint perfume 
Alone is in the virgin air.

Of all her train, the hands of Spring 
First plant thee in the watery mould, 
And I have seen thee blossoming 
Beside the snow-bank's edges cold.

Thy parent sun, who bade thee view 
Pale skies, and chilling moisture sip 
Has bathed thee in his own bright hue, 
And streaked with jet thy glowing lip.

Yet slight thy form, and low thy seat, 
And earthward bent thy gentle eye, 
Unapt the passing view to meet, 
When loftier flowers are flaunting nigh.

Oft, in the sunless April day, 
Thy early smile has stayed my walk; 
But midst the gorgeous blooms of May 
I passed thee on thy humple stalk.

So they, who climb to wealth, forget 
The friends in darker fortunes tried; 
I copied them--but I regret 
That I should ape the ways of pride.

And when again the genial hour 
Awakes the painted tribes of light, 
I'll not o'er look the modest flower 
That made the woods of April bright. 

Crying in the pallid night
Crying in a dreary sleep
Crying torrid shades of ember
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


Crying in a dreary sleep
Crying torrid shades of ember
For the washed out faded days
And the you that I remember

My tears await a supreme sign
To tell them dry or keep on running
My blurry eyes contrive a scheme
Of truthful words that cease becoming
And remain a blissful dream

Wishes don't accept objections
Conviction doesn't face projections
Confidence grows into doctrine
With unimpaired withdrawal signs
Until your memory catches mine


When the 'arf-made recruity goes out to the East
'E acts like a babe an' 'e drinks like a beast,
An' 'e wonders because 'e is frequent deceased
   Ere 'e's fit for to serve as a soldier.
      Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,
      Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,
      Serve, serve, serve as a soldier,
 
Now all you recruities what's drafted to-day,
You shut up your rag-box an' 'ark to my lay,
An' I'll sing you a soldier as far as I may:
   A soldier what's fit for a soldier.
      Fit, fit, fit for a soldier . . .
 
First mind you steer clear o' the grog-sellers' huts,
For they sell you Fixed Bay'nets that rots out your guts --
Ay, drink that 'ud eat the live steel from your butts --
   An' it's bad for the young British soldier.
      Bad, bad, bad for the soldier . . .
 
When the cholera comes -- as it will past a doubt --
Keep out of the wet and don't go on the shout,
For the sickness gets in as the liquor dies out,
   An' it crumples the young British soldier.
      Crum-, crum-, crumples the soldier . . .
 
But the worst o' your foes is the sun over'ead:
You ~must~ wear your 'elmet for all that is said:
If 'e finds you uncovered 'e'll knock you down dead,
   An' you'll die like a fool of a soldier.
      Fool, fool, fool of a soldier . . .
 
If you're cast for fatigue by a sergeant unkind,
Don't grouse like a woman nor crack on nor blind;
Be handy and civil, and then you will find
   That it's beer for the young British soldier.
      Beer, beer, beer for the soldier . . .
 
Now, if you must marry, take care she is old --
A troop-sergeant's widow's the nicest I'm told,
For beauty won't help if your rations is cold,
   Nor love ain't enough for a soldier.
      'Nough, 'nough, 'nough for a soldier . . .
 
If the wife should go wrong with a comrade, be loath
To shoot when you catch 'em -- you'll swing, on my oath! --
Make 'im take 'er and keep 'er:  that's Hell for them both,
   An' you're shut o' the curse of a soldier.
      Curse, curse, curse of a soldier . . .
 
When first under fire an' you're wishful to duck,
Don't look nor take 'eed at the man that is struck,
Be thankful you're livin', and trust to your luck
   And march to your front like a soldier.
      Front, front, front like a soldier . . .
 
When 'arf of your bullets fly wide in the ditch,
Don't call your Martini a cross-eyed old bitch;
She's human as you are -- you treat her as sich,
   An' she'll fight for the young British soldier.
      Fight, fight, fight for the soldier . . .
 
When shakin' their bustles like ladies so fine,
The guns o' the enemy wheel into line,
Shoot low at the limbers an' don't mind the shine,
   For noise never startles the soldier.
      Start-, start-, startles the soldier . . .
 
If your officer's dead and the sergeants look white,
Remember it's ruin to run from a fight:
So take open order, lie down, and sit tight,
   And wait for supports like a soldier.
      Wait, wait, wait like a soldier . . .
 
When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains,
And the women come out to cut up what remains,
Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains
   An' go to your Gawd like a soldier.
      Go, go, go like a soldier,
      Go, go, go like a soldier,
      Go, go, go like a soldier,

The young dead soldiers do not speak. 

Nevertheless, they are heard in the still houses: 
who has not heard them? 

They have a silence that speaks for them at night 
and when the clock counts. 

They say: We were young. We have died. 
Remember us. 

They say: We have done what we could 
but until it is finished it is not done. 

They say: We have given our lives but until it is finished 
no one can know what our lives gave. 

They say: Our deaths are not ours: they are yours, 
they will mean what you make them. 

They say: Whether our lives and our deaths were for 
peace and a new hope or for nothing we cannot say, 
it is you who must say this. 

We leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning. 
We were young, they say. We have died; remember us. 

At ten AM the young housewife
moves about in negligee behind
the wooden walls of her husband’s house.
I pass solitary in my car.

Then again she comes to the curb
to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands
shy, uncorseted, tucking in
stray ends of hair, and I compare her
to a fallen leaf.

The noiseless wheels of my car
rush with a crackling sound over
dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling. 

In dreadful times of tears and war
She sails, a little fixed star, 
Or like a little ship she glides 
With gentle winds and favouring tides
Up to the harbour bar. 


Wrapped in all mild tranquillities 
She muses: inward gaze her eyes; 
And lest she slip upon a stone
Gabriel or some shining one 
Guards her high destinies. 


No rumour reaches her at all, 
Beyond her safe encompassing wall, 
Of a mad world that slays and slays: 
She sees a little one that plays 
And sleeps at evenfall. 


She is in the House of Life: and where 
She goes the angels bend to her, 
A little secret garden-close, 
Sweet with the lily and the rose, 
With frankincense and myrrh. 

No Cautions of a Matron, Old and Sage, 
Young Rattlehead to Prudence cou'd engage; 
But forth the Offspring of her Bed wou'd go, 
Nor reason gave, but that he wou'd do so. 
Much Counsel was, at parting, thrown away, 
Ev'n all, that Mother-Rat to Son cou'd say; 
Who follow'd him with utmost reach of Sight, 
Then, lost in Tears, and in abandon'd Plight, 
Turn'd to her mournful Cell, and bid the World Good-Night. 

But Fortune, kinder than her boding Thought, 
In little time the Vagrant homewards brought, 
Rais'd in his Mind, and mended in his Dress, 
Who the Bel-air did every way confess, 
Had learnt to flow'r his Wigg, nor brusht away 
The falling Meal, that on his Shoulders lay; 
And from a Nutshell, wimbl'd by a Worm, 
Took Snuff, and cou'd the Government reform.

The Mother, weeping from Maternal Love, 
To see him thus prodigiously improve, 
Expected mighty Changes too, within, 
And Wisdom to avoid the Cat, and Gin. 
Whom did you chiefly note, Sweetheart, quoth she, 
Of all the Strangers you abroad did see? 
Who grac'd you most, or did your Fancy take? 
The younger Rat than curs'd a noisy Rake, 
That barr'd the best Acquaintance he cou'd make; 
And fear'd him so, he trembl'd ev'ry Part; 
Nor to describe him, scarce cou'd have the Heart.

High on his Feet (quoth he) himself he bore, 
And terribly, in his own Language, swore; 
A feather'd Arm came out from either Side, 
Which loud he clapp'd, and Combatants defy'd, 
And to each Leg a Bayonette was ty'd: 
And certainly his Head with Wounds was sore; 
For That, and both his Cheeks a Sanguine Colour wore.

Near Him there lay the Creature I admir'd, 
And for a Friend by Sympathy desir'd: 
His Make, like Ours, as far as Tail and Feet, 
With Coat of Furr in parallel do meet; 
Yet seeming of a more exalted Race, 
Tho' humble Meekness beautify'd his Face: 
A purring Sound compos'd his gentle Mind, 
Whilst frequent Slumbers did his Eye-lids bind; 
Whose soft, contracted Paw lay calmly still, 
As if unus'd to prejudice, or kill. 

I paus'd a while, to meditate a Speech, 
And now was stepping just within his reach; 
When that rude Clown began his hect'ring Cry, 
And made me for my Life, and from th' Attempt to fly. 
Indeed 'twas Time, the shiv'ring Beldam said, 
To scour the Plain, and be of Life afraid.

Thou base, degen'rate Seed of injur'd Rats, 
Thou veriest Fool (she cry'd) of all my Brats; 
Would'st thou have shaken Hands with hostile Cats, 
And dost not yet thine Own, and Country's Foe, 
At this expence of Time, and Travel know? 

Alas! that swearing, staring, bullying Thing, 
That tore his Throat, and blustered with his Wing, 
Was but some paltry, Dunghill, Craven Cock, 
Who serves the early Household for a Clock.

And We his Oats, and Barley often steal, 
Nor fear, he shou'd revenge the pilfer'd Meal: 
Whilst that demure, and seeming harmless Puss 
Herself, and mewing Chits regales with Us. 

If then, of useful Sense thou'st gain'd no more, 
Than ere thou'dst past the Threshold of my Door; 
Be here, my Son, content to Dress and Dine, 
Steeping the List of Beauties in thy Wine, 
And neighb'ring Vermin with false Gloss outshine. 

 Amongst Mankind a Thousand Fops we see, 
Who in their Rambles learn no more than Thee; 
Cross o'er the Alpes, and make the Tour of France, 
To learn a paltry Song, or antick Dance; 
Bringing their Noddles, and Valizes pack'd 
With Mysteries, from Shops and Taylors wreck'd: 
But what may prejudice their Native Land; 
Whose Troops are raising, or whose Fleet is mann'd, 
Ne'er moves their Thoughts, nor do they understand. 
Thou, my dear Rattlehead, and such as These 
Might keep at home, and brood on Sloth and Ease: 
Whilst Others, more adapted to the Age, 
May vig'rously in Warlike Feats engage, 
And live on foreign Spoils, or dying thin the Stage. 

Since you were so young, child, I shall
Not fear your noon or even-fall,
Nor dread you are taken unawares,
Nor weary Heaven with many prayers.

I shall not wake at night afraid
Of where your darling head is laid,
Nor say: 'He finds the wind too rough,

I shall have ease though lightnings leap,
Nor hear the thunder in my sleep,
Nor dread the crying of the seas,
Nor any mountain precipice.

Unquiet for some darling sake!
Soft sleeps my little son to-night,
Where many stars make candlelight!

His sword is laid beside his knees;
And I, his mother, may go sleep
And pray for them who wake and weep. 

Beside the brook the boy reclined
      And wove his flowery wreath,
    And to the waves the wreath consigned--
      The waves that danced beneath.
    "So fleet mine hours," he sighed, "away
      Like waves that restless flow:
    And so my flowers of youth decay
      Like those that float below


    "Ask not why I, alone on earth,
      Am sad in life's young time;
    To all the rest are hope and mirth
      When spring renews its prime.
    Alas! the music Nature makes,
      In thousand songs of gladness--
    While charming all around me, wakes
      My heavy heart to sadness


    "Ah! vain to me the joys that break
      From spring, voluptuous are;
    For only one 't is mine to seek--
      The near, yet ever far!
    I stretch my arms, that shadow-shape
      In fond embrace to hold;
    Still doth the shade the clasp escape--
      The heart is unconsoled!"

    "Come forth, fair friend, come forth below,
      And leave thy lofty hall,
    The fairest flowers the spring can know
      In thy dear lap shall fall!
    Clear glides the brook in silver rolled,
      Sweet carols fill the air;
    The meanest hut hath space to hold
      A happy loving pair!"Physical the movements, without any precautions
to set  her tall skinny body nude.
Fanning cast brown hair in statuesque shoulders.
The tight sharp breast protrusions flickered slightly
as she hastened to hide her proud puberty
amid the night's wrinkled sea where the moon,  time ago sank, 
was struggling vainly to keep itself still.
The twin all-white buttocks were found soon
by the dived moon's glow
and set themselves immediately
in a worthily for grace compete with.
Stunned the two lucky of the unexpected scene, 
which was unfolding in front of them
as an on the coast and waters Αphrodite's Epiphany, 
enjoyed the magie spread by the youthfull boldness.
Sweet, marvelous, windy presence of Eros itself 
ready to admit. 

They are always out there
We see them every day
The zombies are everywhere
They smile, talk, laugh and play
They are out there
They are everywhere
They behave in a certain manner
They mind their business
Except during Halloween
They carry an invisible banner
There is certain easiness
About them. They are clean
Easy going and quiet most of the time
The zombies are in their prime
At times, they are like you and me
They are like sharks in the sea
They are like exotic butterflies
They eat burgers and fries
They are always out there
They are everywhere.


The zombies are  most anxious about the graveyard
Before midnight arises, for they make the 
Most petrifying of wails and screams.
Sounding  as if they are being boiled alive
In their own ghastliness, of their slimy and 
Putrid green skin. 

They dare not gander about the graveyard
Before the dead of night arises, for they 
Will be engulfed by the sunlight which 
Sweeps across the grave stones, 
Standing  like forgotten and mysterious 
Relics. 

They are tremendously afraid of the sunlight, 
For it completely obliterates them; causing their skins 
To melt ferociously under 
The searing heat of the sun, 
And  their  bows to spew out disgusting
And putrid mucus. 

When the crow squawks upon the Oak
Tree in the grave yard, the Zombies 
Are wise to know that the dead of night 
Has come to being. 

They ferociously slash their coffins 
To pieces and begin to come  forth from their graves.
The shadows of the zombies spill vengeance and evil 
Upon the grave yard, as they come forth from 
Their graves. 

In morn –
We crawl
We walk in four

At sun high, noon –
In two, we stand and march
To make dreams come true

Burn eyelashes 
On a flaming oil 
Sit erudite; feed the mind
Stand employed, reap some coins
Cherish the glittering hues
Of muscle toil

On dusk –
We append one to embrace us; 
Perchance, a cane or wheel chair
Otherwise an orthopedic walker
As darkness blanket our eyes
To be with the lustrous stars
High up above the vast night sky

~~~~~~~~~

Life rolls and spins
‘Has a perpetual spinning wheel
Of birth and death
Alike the river and streams, surging
Hugging the open sea
Alike the waves rushing, 
To and fro to the expectant sand
Grazing the shore, ‘till the next one

Even tide mingle with autumn
Wherein cockcrow giggle with spring
Halcyon days rave in swim suit
And winter skiing the cold calendar turns

Each turn, age mounting up
Flourishing petals of mind
Before sundown, wrinkles the skin
Exhausting bones until ones demise
Curtains close, so our life’s rebirth
Awaiting a new play at the theater stage



h Of November, bring you to the theatre
(& being you)   
your nipples come too.

Hidden in the slip seats
in the darkness beyond the gods

you sitting on my lap
to get a better view

your nipples
decide to pop out

(take a peek at the proceedings)   

under the influence & guidance

of my intuitive & ever eager fingers.

'Oh! ' they say.
'Ah! ' they say.

Impressed by their first
theatrical experience

I rising to the occasion
giving them a standing ovation.

'Can we come again! '
they plead & plead.

'Oh.  

please! '

'Anytime! '
I promise unhesitantly.

And now your nipples are quite

the theatre
goers.

SUCH A LUVIE! 

Wardrobe malfunction! 
(nipple pops out.  

peeks at play)   
Standing ovation!

THEATRE GOERS was originally this haiku which managed to make itself lost.. so forcing me to write this longer version of the tale  to be told. But. - like the proverbial bad penny it cropped up shortly afterwards.  

so that there are now two points of view to the one story. 

Arctic smiles
Atlantic smiles
Pacific smiles
Himalaya sounds hurray! 

No comparison with their substance, their minds, their ardour, 
Who create tremendous affaire de coeur! 

Someone says-
Love these days
In a state of topsy-turvy.
They said- No.

They pronounced
They provoked
They proved.

No other option switched on
Stranger than fiction! 

Miror to mirror
No error
both within lovely tremor! 

The essence of  quintessence knows, 
Purity of love is only in devotion
That shows.

They smiling
Star moon sun supernova smiling
Jannatul ferdous smiling
Angels smiling
Butterflies smiling
Colour spectrum smiling
Poets of the world are smiling too.

The essence of  quintessence knows, 
Purity of love is only in devotion
That shows.

I dedicate this poem to two  lover,  My friend Faysal of Bangladesh and his Romanian beloved wife Faria. 
They introduced each other through online.
Chatting chatting chatting at last getting into! ! Loving heart captured magnetic heart! ! Love had effloresced! Surprisingly they decided to get married without seeing even each others pictures! what an intense relation between two lovely hearts! Marriage had completed over telephone and then they appeared online camera! Both had gladdened. So no more late.
Faysal was in UAE. According to their decision, Faysal left for Dhaka (capital of Bangladesh) . Faria got on plane from Romania to fly onto meet with her beloved in Dhaka. It was a day of  last month, Faysal received his sweetheart in Dhaka airport. Longing end! No more tears! He and she now within the tremendous calculation  
Long live Faysal, Long live Faria, Long live true love! 

Nor the oceans heave with the blood in their breasts
The voice in the wild wind with no words to lead 'em
Of the power they wielded they've been dispossessed.

They stood in the morning by the new shining strand
And dreamed of a heaven so close to their hands
Feeling blest with a future yet known to no man 
And what they saw they took and called it American.

And the stones are now crying out just as loud as they can
And the rivers are drying out leavin' fish in the sand
And the mountains are fried out or cut down by man 
Mother earth's all but died out — still they don't understand. 

Footsteps echo down a narrow alley, 
black cat on watch, stretches, expanding his claws.
Far away an owl hoots out a warning, 
then silence returns, no banging of doors.

An eerie time reigns when darkness descends, 
each noise seems louder, shattering the night.
And one’s hearing’s sharper, alert to sounds, 
for anything strange can give way to fright.

Everywhere are shadows, lights are dim, 
who would be brave, to venture out late.
Behind every bush is a spooky ghoul, 
ready to scare you, and their niche vacate.

Footsteps echo down a narrow alley, 
Dogs roam, searching for morsels to eat.
Dustbins rattle, hunting gains momentum, 
inquisitive muzzles, scouring the street.

These are the hours for all things nocturnal, 
bats fly, rats scuttle, for their day’s begun.
Nothing’s weird to these wide awake creatures, 
only our footsteps will cause them to run.


Her charms, but she's too full of fire;
Impatience ever racks her breast,
Her heart a stranger is to rest.
A jocund youth of bulky size
This nymph beheld with tender eyes,
From hers his humor differed quite,
Black does not differ more from white.
On his broad face and open mien
There dwelt tranquility serene;
His converse is from languor free
And boisterous vivacity.
His sleep was sound and sweet at night,
Active he was at morn like light;
As day advanced he pleased still more,
Macareus was the name he bore.
His mistress void of thought as fair
Tormented him with too much care:
She adoration thought her due,
And into fierce reproaches flew;
Her Macareus with laughter left,
And of all hopes of bliss bereft.
From clime to clime like mad she ran
To seek the dear, the faithless man:
From him she could not live content,
So first of all to court she went.
There she of every one inquired,
'Is Macareus with you retired?'
Hearing that name the witlings there
To laugh and smile could scarce forbear.
'Madam,' said they, 'who is this squire
Macareus, for whom you inquire?
Madam, his character display,
Or else we shan't know what to say.'
'He is a man,' returned the fair,
'Possessed of each endowment rare,
A man of virtue so refined,
He hated none of human kind;
To whom no man e'er owed a spite,
Who always knew to reason right,
Who void of care lived still at ease,
And knew all human kind to please.'
The courtiers answered with a sneer,
'You are not like to find him here,
Mortals with such endowments rare
But seldom to the court repair.'
The fair then to the city bent
Her way, and stopped a convent.
She thought that in that calm retreat
She might her tranquil lover meet.
'Madam,' then said the under-prior,
The man for whom you thus inquire
We long have waited for in vain,
To visit us he ne'er did deign.
But such a loss to compensate,
We've idle time and vigils late;
We have our stated days of fasting
With discord and divisions lasting.'
A short monk then with crown shaved o'er,
Said, 'Madam, seek this man no more;
For I'm by false reports misled,
Or else your lover's long since dead.'
What the monk insolently said
Made Thelema with rage grow red:
'Brother,' said she, 'I'd have you know
The man who has caused all my woe
Was made for me, and me alone,
He's in this world on which I'm thrown;
With me he'll live and die content,
I'm propery his element:
Who aught else told you, on my word,
Has said a thing that's most absurd.'
This said, away the fair one ran,
Resolved to find the inconstant man.
'At Paris, where the wits abound,
Perhaps,' said she, 'he may be found,
The wits speak of him as a sage;'
On of them said: 'You by our page,
Madam, perhaps have been misled;
When there of Macareus you read,
We spoke of one we never knew.'
Then near she to the law-court drew,
Shutting her eyes, quick passed the fair,
'My love,' she cried, 'can't sure be there;
There's some attraction in the Court,
But who'd to this vile place resort?
Themis' black followers needs must prove
Eternal foes to him I love.'
Fair Thelema at Rameau's shrine,
Where the muse utters strains divine,
The man who her so much neglected
There to meet, was what she expected.
At those feasts oft she was a guest,
Where meet gay people richly dressed;
Such people as we all agree
To call the best of company.
People of an address polite,
She looked upon at the first sight
As perfect copies of her lover;
But she soon after could discover,
That striving most to appear the same,
They still were widest of their aim.
At last the fair one in despair,
Finding how vain was all her care,
And grown of her inquiries tired,
To her retreat would have retired:
The object which she there first spied
Was Macareus by her bedside;
He waited there, hid from her eyes,
That he the fair one might surprise:
'Henceforward,' said he, 'live with me,
From all inquietude be free,
Do not, like vain and haughty dames,
Be too assuming in your claims;
And if you would henceforth possess
My person and my tenderness,
Never more make demands more high
Than suits me with them to comply.'
Who's understood by either name,
Both of the lover and the dame,
The folks who are profound in Greek
Cannot be very far to seek.
Taught by this emblem they'll relate
What's to be every mortal's fate,
Thee, Macareus, though all men choose,
Though much they love thee, oft they lose;
And I'm persuaded that you dwell
With me, though this I fear to tell.
Who boasts that with thee he is blessed,
By envy oft is dispossessed;
A man should know, to make thee sure,
How to live happy while obscure. 

The instructor said,

Go home and write
a page tonight.
And let that page come out of you--
Then, it will be true.

I wonder if it's that simple?
I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.
I went to school there, then Durham, then here
to this college on the hill above Harlem.
I am the only colored student in my class.
The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,
through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,
Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,
the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator
up to my room, sit down, and write this page:

It's not easy to know what is true for you or me 
at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what 
I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
hear you, hear me--we two--you, me, talk on this page.
(I hear New York, too.) Me--who?
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.
I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.
or records--Bessie, bop, or Bach.
I guess being colored doesn't make me not like
the same things other folks like who are other races.
So will my page be colored that I write?

Being me, it will not be white. 
But it will be
a part of you, instructor. 
You are white-- 
yet a part of me, as I am a part of you. 
That's American.
Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me. 
Nor do I often want to be a part of you.
But we are, that's true! 
As I learn from you, 
I guess you learn from me-- 
although you're older--and white-- 
and somewhat more free.

This is my page for English B. 

I spot the hills
With yellow balls in autumn.
I light the prairie cornfields
Orange and tawny gold clusters
And I am called pumpkins.
On the last of October
When dusk is fallen
Children join hands
And circle round me
Singing ghost songs 
And love to the harvest moon;
I am a jack-o'-lantern
With terrible teeth
And the children know
I am fooling. 

I take these bullets out my heart
and put them to use
instead of retaliation
I'll fight these lies inside
and leave them the naked truth

My life lies deperate in despair
dying for truth
Left open wounded without any care
giving them the oppurtunity
to see me raw an uncouth

But will anybody try to search and find
or are they all to scared to see
a reflection of themselves
a vague image a distant past
a worn course of what their lives use to be

Now  also enjoy writing my own verse and thoughts. 

Needless whispers
are screamed, 
much to silent
to ever be worthy, 
of listening.
Perhaps when you
can speak as if I wasn't
as foreign to your heart, 
as I am to your words.

'Then; and only then,

'How do you turn into a flower of the field,
 the lily clothed to make Solomon rue his glory?
 What leap takes off from here towards evolution,
 pointing the way to the pearly everlasting?
 Eons made the flower and flowers have their agendas,
 whatever the population of the field—
 more than a lifetime to construct that airport. 

it is a box of clouds I have opened! 
cried Pandora, suddenly grieved who
looked for festive colors, perhaps a something
to wear, threaded with fine gold

a pair of moon bright slippers.
oh, beyond repair, she wept.
and the room grew dim at noon

the bees swarmed all the colours.
oh honeycomb day, return
she prayed; I will be good.

and hope, flew straight: 

a fairy thread suspending
the earth like a new pearl
on an old necklace

worn out, as a heart ill-used

and then: turning.
then there was shining.
then there was music

Child in white blood bent on its knees
Under the bell of rocks,
Ducked in the twelve, disciple seas
The winder of the water-clocks
Calls a green day and night.
My sea hermaphrodite,
Snail of man in His ship of fires
That burn the bitten decks,
Knew all His horrible desires
The climber of the water sex
Calls the green rock of light.

Who in these labyrinths,
This tidethread and the lane of scales,
Twine in a moon-blown shell,
Escapes to the flat cities' sails
Furled on the fishes' house and hell,
Nor falls to His green myths?
Stretch the salt photographs,
The landscape grief, love in His oils
Mirror from man to whale
That the green child see like a grail
Through veil and fin and fire and coil
Time on the canvas paths.

He films my vanity.
Shot in the wind, by tilted arcs,
Over the water come
Children from homes and children's parks
Who speak on a finger and thumb,
And the masked, headless boy.
His reels and mystery
The winder of the clockwise scene
Wound like a ball of lakes
Then threw on that tide-hoisted screen
Love's image till my heartbone breaks
By a dramatic sea.

Who kills my history?
The year-hedged row is lame with flint,
Blunt scythe and water blade.
'Who could snap off the shapeless print
From your to-morrow-treading shade
With oracle for eye?'
Time kills me terribly.
'Time shall not murder you,' He said,
'Nor the green nought be hurt;
Who could hack out your unsucked heart,
O green and unborn and undead?'
I saw time murder me.[my Father's house, on Sunday afternoons. ]

then we hand coloured the stars on Sunday afternoons
in our Spring colouring books
sitting at the little card table

in the living room
while the March winds blew
in high treetops

out the picture window.
how glad I am to think of how high
on a hill that house was

and of the sound of the winds poured
and a storybook version of Heidi

on a little red record
played over and over
and she is singing and wreathed with flowers

in the high mountains

and the wind is singing
oh you are well
and all the meadows are yours

and you can colour them in
if you want to
whatever crayon you choose.

                    In the dim meadows desolate
                  Dost thou remember Sicily?

                  Still through the ivy flits the bee
                    Where Amaryllis lies in state;
                  O Singer of Persephone!

                  Simaetha calls on Hecate
                    And hears the wild dogs at the gate;
                  Dost thou remember Sicily?

                  Still by the light and laughing sea
                    Poor Polypheme bemoans his fate:
                  O Singer of Persephone!

                  And still in boyish rivalry
                    Young Daphnis challenges his mate:
                  Dost thou remember Sicily?

                  Slim Lacon keeps a goat for thee,
                    For thee the jocund shepherds wait,
                  O Singer of Persephone!
                  Dost thou remember Sicily

THIS mighty empire hath but feet of clay:
            Of all its ancient chivalry and might
            Our little island is forsaken quite:
          Some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay,
          And from its hills that voice hath passed away
            Which spake of Freedom: O come out of it,
            Come out of it, my Soul, thou art not fit
          For this vile traffic-house, where day by day
            Wisdom and reverence are sold at mart,
            And the rude people rage with ignorant cries
          Against an heritage of centuries.
            It mars my calm: wherefore in dreams of Art
            And loftiest culture I would stand apart,

You can get there from here, though
there's no going home.
Everywhere you go will be somewhere
you've never been. Try this:
head south on Mississippi  one-
by-one mile markers ticking off
another minute of your life. Follow this
to its natural conclusion - dead end
at the coast, the pier at Gulfport where
riggings of shrimp boats are loose stitches
in a sky threatening rain. Cross over
the man-made beach, miles of sand
dumped on a mangrove swamp - buried
terrain of the past. Bring only
what you must carry - tome of memory
its random blank pages. On the dock
where you board the boat for Ship Island,
someone will take your picture:
the photograph - who you were - 
will be waiting when you return[to the twenty seven flavors I passed by and
to my Grandfather, Milton B. Young]

I wanted to think through my theories of time
in the ice cream shoppes (you know, 
and research there) 

was it lemon stick in the Howard

Johnson's lodge, or black cherry vanilla
vanilla and were the skies deep turquoise
and the trees rimmed with pumpkin orange

as in a picture postcard where it all matches? 
everyone has family vacations
says the world and the kids at school  but I don't listen

I'm in my own time loop festively
with my Grandfather when he
asks so benignly and I'm sure

nowhere else to anyone else ever
in any other universe; 
are you sure you want lemon stick again? 

love which effect  the life, if you love it.
love which  join's two body into one soul: 
love which change you the whole. 

love plays an important roll in our life: 
love which control your both side.
love which guide us the perfect way: 
love which help you when there is tide in your life.

love is just a four letter word; 
but this word work like a sword. 
that if you are on wrong way: 
it divert you to a perfect way. 

love makes every one perfect: 
love which forget us our past. 
love is a like a wings: 
which give you the perfect swing. 

There are very many who need therapy these days. 
These sensitive people may get counselling sessions
and healing words from a psychologist or psychotherapist; 
but less fortunate people need long-term medication.

Some trust in xanax, prozac, diazepam or sertraline, 
while others throw these tablets in the rubbish bin.
Some find that reading poetry and novels is therapeutic, 
while others get a buzz  chilling out with pop music.

Some seek help from a health professional: 
others are in and out of a priest's confessional.
Some eagerly take up pilates, yoga, older ones tai chi, 
learning to breathe and meditate like a maharishi.

Some strive like gymnasts for fitness and agility 
by going to the gym and onto the cycles and treadmill.
Others, like Olympic athletes, go distance running daily, 
knowing that it puts 'feel-good'endorphins in the body.


Indeed there are many choices of therapy if you need it: 
counselling, tranquillisers, meditation, or exercise stints.
I have tried some of the above, but a doctor told me: 
'The answer to your problems will not come out of a bottle.'

           -March, 

There are holes in the sky
Where the rain gets in
But they're ever so small
That's why the rain is thin. 

there are many rooms
but only one soul

there are many scenes
on your revolving stage

there is a curtain that
blows in and out
if you cross the room

and open the window
looking for
forgotten consolations

dreams rush in with the wind
everytime and you couldn't explain
to anyone if you were asked: 
'.  

the first dream or the last? '
it's not the sequence you care about

there is your
suspension of belief and then: 
the many-tiered music begins again

temple of silvery farawayness I guard her to rest.

For her bed I write a stillness over all the swans of the
world. With the morning breath of the snow leopard I
cover her against any hurt.

Using the pen of rivers and mountaintops I store her
pillow with singing.

Upon her hair I write the looking of the heavens at
early morning.

-- Away from this kingdom, from this last undefiled
place, I would keep our governments, our civilization, and
all other spirit-forsaken and corrupt institutions.

O cold beautiful blossoms of the moon moving upon
her shoulders . . . the lips of the moon moving there . . .
where the touch of any other lips would be a profanation. 

there are some things that you will know
painted into the corner of your age, 
your childhood home: 

the apples and oranges weighed up
in the fairy tale scales of gold; 
the presents at the time, unwrapped; 

you can't look back or forwards then

nor peering down any toychest kaleidoscope
prophetically to see beyond
your colouring book's outlines though you

think you should be
in between roadstops for cherry vanilla
connecting new dots on the maps

and though you feel at times
an unease when you think this
musing over the paper doll wardrobes

pointing a finger
through the childhood haze
because it comes to you on certain days

there must be something I should know I don't
you won't, no matter how hard you try
and so you continue to dream

and hear
the wind strum through the trees
so visibly

that you forget to understand
what can't be understood, anyway.

     and fix things.
They drink coffee at dawn,
     beer after work,

And those who stay clean,
     just appreciate things,
At breakfast they have milk
     and juice at night.

There are those who do both,
     they drink tea.



there are times we laugh, 
there are times we cry, 
times we feel like we're on top of the world, 
times we feel as though lifes not worth living. 
what we feel can change within a matter of seconds, 
it's a reflection of how we react to different situations. 
things could go wrong or right, 
things could happen that you wouldn't have a clue what happened, 
but you feel as though they hate you and are ignoring you, 
but find out it's not true.


In the hearts of souls neglected
Who are oft times called and pitted
Against the fortunes of 
Our times-

The weak and wealthy dread it
For there's not one whit thats added
To the dwellers who homesteaded
By the glittering shores 
of time.

Who in eternity dwells, sans avarice
The halls of posterity will cherish
And know the truth unembellished
In the nothingness of the
Sublime

Where you are is where you're headed
And past season's feathers shedded
Among the clouds on paths 
Untreaded
Free as an eagle you will 
Fly. 

There be none of Beauty's daughters
With a magic like Thee; 
And like music on the waters
Is thy sweet voice to me:
When, as if its sound were causing
The charmed ocean's pausing,
The waves lie still and gleaming,
And the lull'd winds seem dreaming:
And the midnight moon is weaving
Her bright chain o'er the deep,
Whose breast is gently heaving
As an infant's asleep:
So the spirit bows before thee
To listen and adore thee; 
With a full but soft emotion,
Like the swell of Summer's ocean. 

There comes a time when, 
one finds shut, all the doors.
The feet long to take a step, but, 
find no trail to walk on.

On the radio, 
listening to the melodies
of some far off land, 
watching a movie, 
putting the old books in order, 
reminiscing the ancestral abodes
or, saying goodbye to some one, 
the eyes get wet.

In the podiums full of sunshine, 
the melancholy comes and 
occupies the empty chairs, and
just like that, 
misty and rainy spell, 
engulfs everything

There comes a time when, 
a man finds himself alone, 
among all the people around-! ! ! 


A shorter breath of Day
A stealing that is not a stealth
And Summers are away


There is a boat down on the quay come home at last.
The paint's chipped, the sails stained as if
Time's pissed up against them.
I imagine the sea routes it's followed,
Sailing through the world's sunken veins
With its cargo of longings;
A little boat that's nuzzled its way
Into the armpits of forests,
That's sliced through the moon's reflection,
Through the phosphate that clings to the lips of waves.
I knew its crew once,
Those boys manacled to freedom
Who set sail over half a century ago,
And were like giants to me.
A solitary child in awe of oceans
I saw them peel their shadows from the land
And watched as they departed.
What did they think when they peered
Over the rim of the world,
Where Time roared and bubbled
And angels swooped like swallows?
Reading an ancient Morse code of starlight,
Stranded by the longing to be elsewhere,
What secrets did they learn to forget?
I longed to be among them,
A passenger curled up in fate's pocket,
I longed to be a part of them - 
Those ghosts who set sail in my childhood,
Those phantoms who shaped me,
That marvellous crew for whom
I have stretched a simple goodbye
Out over a lifetime. 

THERE is a bondage worse, far worse, to bear
Than his who breathes, by roof, and floor, and wall,
Pent in, a Tyrant's solitary Thrall:
'Tis his who walks about in the open air,
One of a Nation who, henceforth, must wear
Their fetters in their souls. For who could be,
Who, even the best, in such condition, free
From self-reproach, reproach that he must share
With Human-nature? Never be it ours
To see the sun how brightly it will shine, 
And know that noble feelings, manly powers,
Instead of gathering strength, must droop and pine;
And earth with all her pleasant fruits and flowers
Fade, and participate in man's decline. 

At the end of the tunnel, there is a burgeoning light.
It is too early to say goodbye; the time is not right.
Spring is around the corner, and better days are ahead.
You must have had a very bad day. Please go to bed, 
Then call me in the morning. You need more sleep, 
So you can gather yourself together. This is really deep.
You ought to think again, you need to dream again.
You must have a very short memory. You must be in pain.
Talk to me, speak loud, and tell me again what is in your mind.
Do not forget to be natural, courteous, polite and kind.
Please take a deep breath to get yourself together.
True love is never temporary, true love is forever.
Emotions like seasons come and go, please go to the core
To find yourself again. Please, please do not shut the door.
There is a burgeoning light at the end of the rocky road.
It is too early to say goodbye. Come now, so we can unload
The negative vibrations and the unusual emotions
That are destroying our love. Let's cease all hostile actions
Which we will inevitably regret. The time is young and right.
At the end of the icy road, there exists an undying light.

In separation from the Friend, there is a cut waiting to be
stitched.
O, you who are ignorant of endurance and the burning
fire of love--
Love comes of its own free will, it can't be learned
in any school. 

beneath the setting sun
a boy is quietly wishing

the dove is on its nest
a youthful bride is hoping

a call for peace awaits
as children laugh and play
         .
beneath the setting sun
the wars have just begun

an old woman weeps
a man looks to the sky

beneath the setting sun
I hear the clock ticking


There is a community of the spirit.
Join it, and feel the delight
of walking in the noisy street
and being the noise.
Drink all your passion, 
and be a disgrace.
Close both eyes 
to see with the other eye. 

there is a dollhouse in my head
where I can go and just be fed
on tiny plates with cherry tarts

in shapes of hearts
and it not even
Valentine's day.

and only I can have the key
into my dollhouse mystery
and close the door

and go inside
where books of endless joys
abide

a tiny cat that has no need
but just to purr upon my knee
a chimney brave that has no smoke

but looks so real to dollish folk
that santa claus on  miniature sleigh

and fill my tiny cottage full
with baby oranges, golden hulls
till penny bright I'll say goodnight

and draw the dollhouse curtains all
and sleep my sleep and dream my dream
until the tiny tiny Spring.

     Where roses and white lilies grow;
     A heav'nly paradise is that place
     Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow.
           There cherries grow which none may buy,
           Till 'Cherry ripe' themselves do cry.

       Those cherries fairly do enclose
     Of orient pearl a double row,
     Which when her lovely laughter shows,
   They look like rose-buds fill'd with snow;
         Yet them nor peer nor prince can buy,
         Till 'Cherry ripe' themselves do cry.

     Her eyes like angels watch them still,
  Her brows like bended bows do stand,
   Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill
   All that attempt with eye or hand
         Those sacred cherries to come nigh,
         Till 'Cherry ripe' themselves do cry. 

THERE is a green hill far away,  
 Without a city wall,  
 Who died to save us all.  
 
We may not know, we cannot tell  
 What pains he had to bear,  
But we believe it was for us  
 He hung and suffer’d there.  
 
He died that we might be forgiven,  
 He died to make us good, 
That we might go at last to heaven,  
 Sav’d by his precious blood.  
 
There was no other good enough  
 To pay the price of sin;  
He only could unlock the gate 
 Of heaven, and let us in.  
 
O dearly, dearly has he lov’d,  
 And we must love him too,  
And trust in his redeeming blood,  
 And try his works to do. 

there is a knight on the edge of my butterknife
I can scarcely see
all crystal having been banished from sparkling

in the castle
and he is charging at something.
he is in golden armor naturally

catching the late sun surreptitiously
so that the gold fish swim
more frantically in the bowl

wanting to be the only gold accents in the room.
how will the story end? 
will he charge the marmalade? 

will he play the fool and turn to dusky grim? 

will this upset the children? 
or will he retreat into the
blue sugar bowl

knowing tomorrow is another
anthill to climb.

There is a gem in the mountain of your body, seek that
mine. 
O traveler, if you are in search of That
Don't look outside, look inside yourself and seek That. 

There is a man that's so hollow
Nothing fills him up
Though he keeps on going on
His thirst is always rife
So he drinks, drinks and drinks
Drowning 
Deep into the sea of emptiness
His loves are many
But he is never happy
He takes the centre stage
And the strangers would cheer
at him
Yet behind his closed door
Tears roll down his face
He works over time, all the time
But his tasks are never done
That this man wasn’t METhere is a wheel inside my head
Of wantonness and wine,
An old, cracked fiddle is begging without,
But the wind with scents of the sea is fed,
And the sun seems glad to shine.

The sun and the wind are akin to you,
As you are akin to June.
But the fiddle! . . . It giggles and twitters about,
And, love and laughter! who gave him the cue? -
He's playing your favourite tune. 

There is a yawning pit underneath you, 
and you are dancing overhead. 
Pray, Sir, how can you bring yourself to dance? 
See, the riches you are amassing here, 
nothing of them will go with you. 
Pray, Sir, how can you relish your food and drink

There is an Eminence,--of these our hills 
The last that parleys with the setting sun; 
We can behold it from our orchard-seat; 
And, when at evening we pursue out walk 
Along the public way, this Peak, so high 
Above us, and so distant in its height, 
Is visible; and often seems to send 
Its own deep quiet to restore our hearts. 
The meteors make of it a favourite haunt: 
The star of Jove, so beautiful and large 
In the mid heavens, is never half so fair 
As when he shines above it. 'Tis in truth 
The loneliest place we have among the clouds. 
And She who dwells with me, whom I have loved 
With such communion, that no place on earth 
Can ever be a solitude to me, 
Hath to this lonely Summit given my Name. 

there is love in you

Love was never old
Love was never new

Love  is always there
There is love
Love was never lost

Only we were lost
we never looked at ourself

Human are busy
Human are growing
Because of love

Hearts were never weak
Never timid
Love was there
And
Love is right here

Otherwise
You wouldn’t have these senses
Otherwise
I would not have known you never
Everything would have been 
Like goya’s painting
Devouring demon

But we are beautiful human

If you have pain
Laugh out loud
In the rain

I still see love 
In everyone
In everything
Otherwise

You would have never smiled
Back at mankind. 

There is neither you, nor I; 
neither the object of meditation, 
nor the process of meditation; 
The Father of all action forgot Himself there.
The blind did not see any relationship and support there,

Generosity of the earth, 
For whatever its worth.

There is no charge

The fragrance of flowers, 
At any time and hour.

There is no charge

The shade of a beckoning tree, 
Offering shelter to a refugee.

There is no charge

The birds early morning orchestra, 
Uplifting like chanting a mantra.

There is no charge

Motherly caress of the gentle breeze, 
So soothing, stress is released.

There is no charge

Days and nights, 
Nature’s cues to sleep and rise.

There is no charge

Watching the ebb and flow of ocean tide, 
As the Sun  sets and goes to hide.

There is no charge

did you say everything is expensive, 
how can  any one be happy.


What if nature gave you a whack
And tried to teach you what is lack.
Can you handle her balance sheet? 
Indignant, you’ll scream, you cheat, you cheat

"And truly it's a blessing,
For what He might have done with us
It's better only guessing


"or really, if there may be,
He surely did not mean a man
Always to be a baby


The tradesman thinks, "'twere funny
If He should take it ill in me
To make a little money


"Whether there be," the rich man says,
"It matters very little,
For I and mine, thank somebody,
Are not in want of victual


Some others, also, to themselves,
Who scarce so much as doubt it,
Think there is none, when they are well,
And do not think about it.

But country folks who live beneath
The shadow of the steeple;
The parson and the parson's wife,
And mostly married people;

Youths green and happy in first love,
So thankful for illusion;
And men caught out in what the world
Calls guilt, in first confusion;

And almost everyone when age,
Disease, or sorrows strike him,
Or something very like Him. 

Among thieves and murderers, 
There is no honour among them, 
They plunder and kill, 
lied behind their smiles, 
pretend and talked a smooth talk, 
and even  turn on their own.
Some are fools, and they dance when their master say dance, 
But many nowadays, they come as presidents and ministers-
Pretending to be your most understanding and helping friends, 
But they come only to steal your wealth, 
To enslave you! 
So beware

Facsimiles of Aphrodite, Psyche and Selene
Characters changed; personalities shifted
Faces blurred; bodies cyanosed

Hard copies of saints, nobles and philanthropists
Intentions corrupted; benefits relinquished
Hopes burnt; smokes inhaled

It has been more than three decades now
Still I couldn’t find the thing called Love
Today I chewed my mind over it for hours
But couldn’t find a logic behind this famine

Absence of love in life
Can be an individual
Or universal ambiance
You agree or not
Yet I would say
Life’s like that 


Feb here is no news that I could send you 

Over blooming mango orchard falling collapsed again
For bitter sunlight, hidden mist and early rains; 
Irresistible weeds commanding over grain-fields

It has been raining for three years, cats and dogs, 
Supernatural, nonstop; 
Weather bureau unable to take any step
But muttering and whispering.

The bright feathered birds that used to sing
Swinging their body plumage are faded, exhausted; 
Oozing feathers, they are no more birds  now.

The dog is dead and going to be rotten 
At the Hyacinth- filled pool edge.

There is no news to tell you 

In stead of forming informative sentences, again and again
I have to compose a one and only interrogative: 
'Where are you'? 

Besides, in my thought, 
There is no more grammar for syntax. 

Fear is regression
regression is pain
pain turns sweet sunshine into bitter rain
take my hand my dear
for there is nothing to fear

Fear is anguish
anguish is sorrow
sorrow is but a deep hole so hollow
let this not be the end of me
hold me tight and set me free
oh embrace me so close, so near
for there is nothing really ever to fear

Fear is destruction
destruction is chaos
chaos is a cynical and unruly boss
that can become your surpressive master
do not let fear take control
of the every corner of your innocent soul

Take my hand oh my dear
hold me so very near
for there is nothing that we should ever fear

There is a pleasure in the pathless woods, 
There is a rapture on the lonely shore, 
There is society, where none intrudes, 
By the deep sea, and music in its roar: 
I love not man the less, but Nature more, 
From these our interviews, in which I steal 
From all I may be, or have been before, 
To mingle with the Universe, and feel 
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal. 

There is no black love
For the feast of Valentino
There is simply: LOVE.

There is no white love
In the cappuccino
There is simply: LOVE.

Coffee will always be black
Milk is sometimes white
And chocolate on occasion brown.

Mix all three and the ending product
Is just kaleidoscopically divine
Out of this world, almost perfect.

Love has a great mind
That’s why he or she is blind
This is something that is hard to find.

Love has no color
Love has simply great flavor
And great taste like a classic wine. 

There is no Negro love
No Caucasian love
And no Hispanic love.

There is simply: LOVE.




Is this sea as bautiful as this everyday? 
Does the sky look like this all the time? 
This furniture, these windows, 
Are they always as beautiful as this? 
No, 
There is something strange going on. 

There is something that I wish to tell you, 
However I don’t know how you will react.
With your recent misfortunes, 
You’re already down, 
However, you never show it.
All I hope is that you feel the same way, 
If not, I still don’t want to lose you.
Not being able to talk to you ever again, 
Is something I don’t want to even consider.
My one, true friend.


This little world that in my thinking lies; 
For mine own bosom is the paradise 
Where all my life's fair visions are unfurled. 
Within my nature's shell I slumber curled, 
Unmindful of the changing outer skies, 
Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies, 
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled. 
I heed them not; or if the subtle night 
Haunt me with deities I never saw, 
I soon mine eyelid's drowsy curtain draw 
To hide their myriad faces from my sight. 
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe 
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw. 

There once was a pot
It was filled with non-sense
So it was simply sent away
To a very beautiful place
Where everyone wore a beautiful face
Where some things disappeared without a trace
Others appeared at once
Some closed their eyes and dreamt away
Some walked through doors and down stairways
Some wrote scripts to act out plays
But most ate the mushrooms that grew
Fresh picked fruit, their juices flooded her mouth
She walked around bare footed with long brown hair 
She had a blue eyed stare and a small twitching nose like a hare
A big beautiful grin connecting to blushing dimples
The way she walked, the way she talked was o’ so simple 
She sung along with the drops of the rain
And the whistle of the train
She whistled along as she sat swinging
Day Dreaming and thinking
Relaxed in body and soul
Boarding the train smelling the sweet air and feeling whole
As it sped across the water the scenery melt into a tangled web
A black widow spinning while dining on her mate
It slows to a halt and breaks the clock and burst through the gate
Millions of Billions of Doors floating all around
Sealed with her loving kiss and a whisper of a sound


Sixty years ago, 
the two of us rode tricycles
up a little hill
behind our school.
Nothing stopped us till  
mothers called us home.

Sixty years later, 
we ride mountain bikes
in this wilderness.
We'll keep pedaling till
someone takes our bikes.
We know that someone will. 

Your wife told me
you haven't been 
to church in years.
She's worried
about your heart.
Skips a beat? 
 
Let's stop for coffee
and you can fill me in.
There's not much time.
Maybe we should stop 
for a beer instead.
There's a cliff ahead. 

Even the impossible can be done
because i believe it can
the toughest challenge can be won
because i am a fighting man
.  

there's a fire burning in my eyes, 
because i'm after the prize.

Anything far-fetched can be achieved
yes, it can be done
because in truth i believe
that i am the right one
but thats no surprize, 
cause' there's a fire burning in my eyes.

Anything unlikely can be overcome
in an hour of darkness
even though there exists some
who think the situation is hopeless
but my spirit never dies, 
because there's a fire burning in my eyes.

My heart is ablaze
with the flame of triumph
my soul alight
with this fire of success
an eternal inferno 
rages wthin me
and when you peer into my eyes
then you will see
the fire burninig within.

.  

The fire burning within my eyes. 

theres a man
who makes me feel

theres a man
who hard and rough
who makes me scream when he speeds it up

theres a man
who soft and gentle
who makes me moan 
when he slows it down

and i love the way this man makes me feel



THE moon shines in my body, but my blind eyes cannot see it:
The moon is within me, and so is the sun.
The unstruck drum of Eternity is sounded within me; but my deaf ears cannot hear it.

So long as man clamours for the I and the Mine, his works are as naught:
For work has no other aim than the getting of knowledge:
When that comes, then work is put away.

The flower blooms for the fruit: when the fruit comes, the flower withers.
The musk is in the deer, but it seeks it not within itself: it wanders in quest of grass. 

There's a music that echoes
When an ancient bell rings
Live the dying breath of a hero
Seeing his purpose fulfilled
Now this ain't my first rodeo 
And I ain't got time to kill
You'll find my only portfolio
On a stone on some hill-

This highway to nowhere
Just ain't makin' ends meet
Our house is so damn bare
Even the rats 're all gone
I'm working for my share
Still ain't got what we need
Shit's getting old out there
But I'm still goin' strong-

It ain't that I don't dare 
Kick the world in the thong
And my son has no blank stare
When he looks at the morn
But the bastards wait somewhere 
For see me flag in defeat
And say that I don't care
And sell my life for a song-

Eagles high in the bright sun
In holy silence and mirth
See the old homeless person
Who won't abandon his search 
The stars won't be outdone
By no millionaire's purse-
There ain't no reason to run 
From this ole universe. 

There's a place in the green green grass of home 
Where I strive to be in unity 
Where the river finds its home 
And I know I'll never be lonely 

There's a place in the sun 
Where always there's lots of fun 
Where only positive memories reside 
And in all honesty there's nothing to hide 

There's a place where you and I meet 
In the infinity of yesterday today tomorrow 
And life goes on without anymore sorrow 
And once again we will greet 

There's somewhere within tomorrow and yesterday 
Where we meet with the uncertainty of today 
And we'll empower ourselves and move towards tomorrow 
And with time to borrow forget about yesterday's sorrow 

There's a place in the space of your infinite mind 
Where you discover the child within 
And become forever young again


There's a regret
So grinding, so immitigably sad,
Remorse thereby feels tolerant, even glad. . 
Do you not know it yet?

For deeds undone
Rnakle and snarl and hunger for their due,
Till there seems naught so despicable as you
In all the grin o' the sun.

Like an old shoe
The sea spurns and the land abhors, you lie
About the beach of Time, till by and by
Death, that derides you too --

Death, as he goes
His ragman's round, espies you, where you stray,
With half-an-eye, and kicks you out of his way
And then -- and then, who knows

But the kind Grave
Turns on you, and you feel the convict Worm,
In that black bridewell working out his term,
Hanker and grope and crave?

"Poor fool that might --
That might, yet would not, dared not, let this be,
Think of it, here and thus made over to me
In the implacable night!"

And writhing, fain
And like a triumphing lover, he shall take,
His fill where no high memory lives to make
His obscene victory vain. 

We were just little children 
When our neighbour 
That funny and clever mister 
Who loved drinking beer 
Died of too much drink. 

I remember 
How we loved him, 
And the songs he sung 
When he got drunk. 
They were so strange 
And outlandish 
We loved them as well. 

Mother replied then 
That he went to heaven 
Where there is more beer 
To answer our question "why he left here? " 

Now, 
I know she said that for our sake 
And knowing that any answer we’d take 
For I know in heaven there is no beer. 

Is there

There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction they are going!
There's no knowing where they're rowing,
Or which way they river's flowing!
Not a speck of light is showing,
So the danger must be growing,
For the rowers keep on rowing,
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing.  

There isn't one like no other 
Who will make a way 
Out of no way 
No one can do what 
I have decided and persuaded 
There is no one like You. 

there's no place like home

that's what they say

not many people 

really understand that

when you cant go home

when you cant 

seem to find a place

there's a yearning 

for belonging

for a familiar place

for a family

for a friend

yet you cant 

seem to fit

and the yearning

it grows stronger by the day

you pray and pray 

to find that place

but you cant 

you try and you try

still no luck

over and over

again and again

faster and slower

looking here

looking there

looking up

looking down

pondering this

pondering that

trying so hard

to find your right place

to find where you belong

to feel like you are home

slowly but surely

your strength and confidence

grow weaker and weaker

your strength to keep going

is less and less

your heart cannot 

take the unbearable pain

of hoping and hoping

but never getting it right

it hurts and it hurts

now quicker and quicker

it picks up the pace

less and less

you yearn for this place

the place you call home 

is nowhere in sight

your heart is breaking 

you won't make it 

through the night

its nearly morning 

when lay to rest

leaving sad rose petals 

where you took your last breath. 

Two long had Lov'd, and now the Nymph desir'd, 
The Cloak of Wedlock, as the Case requir'd; 
Urg'd that, the Day he wrought her to this Sorrow, 
He Vow'd, that he wou'd marry her To-Morrow. 
Agen he Swears, to shun the present Storm, 
That he, To-Morrow, will that Vow perform. 
The Morrows in their due Successions came; 
Impatient still on Each, the pregnant Dame 
Urg'd him to keep his Word, and still he swore the same. 
When tir'd at length, and meaning no Redress, 
But yet the Lye not caring to confess, 
He for his Oath this Salvo chose to borrow, 
That he was Free, since there was no To-Morrow; 
For when it comes in Place to be employ'd, 
'Tis then To-Day; To-Morrow's ne'er enjoy'd. 

The Tale's a Jest, the Moral is a Truth; 
To-Morrow and To-Morrow, cheat our Youth: 
In riper Age, To-Morrow still we cry, 
Not thinking, that the present Day we Dye; 
Unpractis'd all the Good we had Design'd; 
There's No To-Morrow to a Willing Mind. 

There's something like booze in the air: 
Makes you feel down and out.  
If you're eating your heart out because you're here 
And you miss her - 
That crushes you. 

There's something like booze in the air: 
Goes to your head, gets you drunk. 

There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs 
And islands of Winander!--many a time, 
At evening, when the earliest stars began 
To move along the edges of the hills, 
Rising or setting, would he stand alone, 
Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake; 
And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands 
Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth 
Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, 
Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls, 
That they might answer him.--And they would shout 
Across the watery vale, and shout again, 
Responsive to his call,--with quivering peals, 
And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud 
Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild 
Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause 
Of silence such as baffled his best skill: 
Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung 
Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise 
Has carried far into his heart the voice 
Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene 
Would enter unawares into his mind 
With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, 
Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received 
Into the bosom of the steady lake. 
This boy was taken from his mates, and died 
In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old. 
Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale 
Where he was born and bred: the churchyard hangs 
Upon a slope above the village-school; 
And, through that church-yard when my way has led 
On summer-evenings, I believe, that there 
A long half-hour together I have stood 
Mute--looking at the grave in which he lies

there was a boy i used to love
he was the only one i was thinking of
but now that boy has gone
to the dark side of temtation
do i follow or do i stay
is he worth throwing my life away
can i make hime see
that this isn't the way life should be
sex drugs and rock n roll
roll the dice and see where they fall
get a job sort out your life
and yet i love you still
my life long friend
with too much time to kill


There was a saviour
Rarer than radium,
Commoner than water, crueller than truth;
Children kept from the sun
Assembled at his tongue
To hear the golden note turn in a groove,
Prisoners of wishes locked their eyes
In the jails and studies of his keyless smiles.

The voice of children says
From a lost wilderness
There was calm to be done in his safe unrest,
When hindering man hurt
Man, animal, or bird
We hid our fears in that murdering breath,
Silence, silence to do, when earth grew loud,
In lairs and asylums of the tremendous shout.

There was glory to hear
In the churches of his tears,
Under his downy arm you sighed as he struck,
O you who could not cry
On to the ground when a man died
Put a tear for joy in the unearthly flood
And laid your cheek against a cloud-formed shell:
Now in the dark there is only yourself and myself.

Two proud, blacked brothers cry,
Winter-locked side by side,
To this inhospitable hollow year,
O we who could not stir
One lean sigh when we heard
Greed on man beating near and fire neighbour
But wailed and nested in the sky-blue wall
Now break a giant tear for the little known fall,

For the drooping of homes
That did not nurse our bones,
Brave deaths of only ones but never found,
Now see, alone in us,
Our own true strangers' dust
Ride through the doors of our unentered house.
Exiled in us we arouse the soft,
Unclenched, armless, silk and rough love that breaks all rocks. 

THERE was a small boy of Quebec,	
Who was buried in snow to his neck;	
  When they said. "Are you friz?"	
  He replied, "Yes, I is—	
But we don't call this cold in Quebec

"There was a time, I need not name,
   Since it will ne'er forgotten be,
When all our feelings were the same
   As still my soul hath been to thee.

And from that hour when first thy tongue
   Confess'd a love which equall'd mine,
Though many a grief my heart hath wrung,
   Unknown, and thus unfelt, by thine,

None, none hath sunk so deep as this---
   To think how all that love hath flown;
Transient as every faithless kiss,
   But transient in thy breast alone.

And yet my heart some solace knew,
   When late I heard thy lips declare,
In accents once imagined true,
   Remembrance of the days that were.

Yes! my adored, yet most unkind!
   Though thou wilt never love again,
To me 'tis doubly sweet to find
   Remembrance of that love remain.

Yes! 'tis a glorious thought to me,
   Nor longer shall my soul repine,
Whate'er thou art or e'er shalt be,
   Thou hast been dearly, solely mine. 

There was a young lady whose eyes,
were unique as to colour and size;
When she opened them wide,
people all turned aside,
and started away in surprise. 

There was an Old Lady whose folly
Induced her to sit in a holly:
Whereupon by a thorn
Her dress being torn,
She quickly became melancholy. 

There was an Old Man in a tree,
Who was horribly bored by a bee.
When they said "Does it buzz?"
He replied "Yes, it does!
It's a regular brute of a bee!"




There was an old man of Calcutta,
Who perpetually ate bread & butter;
Till a great bit of muffin on which he was stuffing,
Choked that horrid old man of Calcutta. 


THERE WAS AN OLD MAN OF NEW YORK, WHO MURDERED HIMSELF WITH A FORK; 
  BUT NOBODY CRIED THOUGH HE VERY SOON DIED, --
  FOR THAT SILLY OLD MAN OF NEW YORK. 


There was an old man of the Cape
Who made himself garments of crepe.
When asked, "Do they tear?"
He replied, "Here and there,
But they're perfectly splendid for shape!


"There was an old man of Thermopylae, 
Who never did anything properly; 
But they said, "If you choose, To boil eggs in your shoes, 
You shall never remain in Thermopylae

"There was an old man on the Border, 
  Who lived in the utmost disorder; 
  He danced with the cat, and made tea in his hat, 
  Which vexed all the folks on the Border. 

There was an Old Man with a beard,
Who said, "It is just as I feared! --
Two Owls and a Hen, four Larks and a Wren,
Have all built their nests in my beard. 

There was an old person of Nice, 
  Whose associates were usually Geese. 
  They walked out together, in all sorts of weather. 
  That affable person of Nice

There weren't tears in my eyes for so many days. 

It seems to be raining here, 
when one sees through the moist eyes
even for a while
as if, the ocean has started stalking
among the thick clouds
Tell me
for how long shall I
conceal the mute torrents flowing
in the every direction of the life, 
keep telling
the tales never told before, 
keep walking
on the subterranean paths of the being, 
keep seeing
the same old dreams of eternity, 
and keep burning
in the shades of invisible foliage
of your thick green gardens
The façade of your affection lacks the eyes
Behind the darkness of centuries old
worn-out abodes, under the trees where, 
splashing the chit-chat
we have stopped for a while, 
some shadows are busy
illuminating the place for us, 
the birds are singing
their songs for us, 
the moments, which are
the offspring of bygone times, 
have come to sneak a look at us
But, tell me
for how long
the ages will keep breathing for us
One fine day, they’ll say
"it’s all over-
Driver, get all the luggage, 
the car is in the portico! "
Tell me
for how long shall I
sustain myself with the help of
capsules made up of the words and
syrups constituted of the poems
This gasping shroud of mine
is tattered already
for how long shall I keep mending it-? 



There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound; 

And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum trees in tremulous white; 

Robins will wear their feathery fire,
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; 

And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,
If mankind perished utterly; 

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn
Would scarcely know that we were gone. 

It could be the name of a prehistoric beast
that roamed the Paleozoic earth, rising up
on its hind legs to show off its large vocabulary,
or some lover in a myth who is metamorphosed into a book.

It means treasury, but it is just a place
where words congregate with their relatives,
a big park where hundreds of family reunions
are always being held,
house, home, abode, dwelling, lodgings, and digs,
all sharing the same picnic basket and thermos;
hairy, hirsute, woolly, furry, fleecy, and shaggy
all running a sack race or throwing horseshoes,
inert, static, motionless, fixed and immobile
standing and kneeling in rows for a group photograph.

Here father is next to sire and brother close
to sibling, separated only by fine shades of meaning.
And every group has its odd cousin, the one
who traveled the farthest to be here:
astereognosis, polydipsia, or some eleven
syllable, unpronounceable substitute for the word tool.
Even their own relatives have to squint at their name tags.

I can see my own copy up on a high shelf.
I rarely open it, because I know there is no
such thing as a synonym and because I get nervous
around people who always assemble with their own kind,
forming clubs and nailing signs to closed front doors
while others huddle alone in the dark streets.

I would rather see words out on their own, away
from their families and the warehouse of Roget,
wandering the world where they sometimes fall
in love with a completely different word.
Surely, you have seen pairs of them standing forever
next to each other on the same line inside a poem,
a small chapel where weddings like these,
between perfect strangers, can take place. 

are the desolate, dark weeks
when nature in its barrenness
equals the stupidity of man.

The year plunges into night
and the heart plunges
lower than night

to an empty, windswept place
without sun, stars or moon
but a peculiar light as of thought

that spins a dark fire -
whirling upon itself until, 
in the cold, it kindles

to make a man aware of nothing
that he knows, not loneliness
itself - Not a ghost but

would be embraced - emptiness
despair - (They
whine and whistle)  among

the flashes and booms of war; 
houses of whose rooms
the cold is greater than can be thought, 

the people gone that we loved, 
the beds lying empty, the couches
damp, the chairs unused -

Hide it away somewhere
out of mind, let it get to roots
and grow, unrelated to jealous

ears and eyes - for itself.
In this mine they come to dig - all.
Is this the counterfoil to sweetest

music?  The source of poetry that
seeing the clock stopped, says, 
The clock has stopped

that ticked yesterday so well? 
and hears the sound of lakewater
splashing - that is now stone. 

lots and lots of these and those
everyday, every minute, every second, 
at first we lose the it
and then the he and she
and then the you

and you think about regrets and remorse
but how can i ever tell you to change
now you are back
to a certain beginning about this and that 

i give up. i close my ears. i listen to my i-pod.
i see you talking. i will not hear you.

you are far away, like a newly discovered planet still unnamed.
indeed, even that, you are still a controversy, a rumor, to be. 

These divine verses,
As I write
Are
The hallowed revelations
Descending
From on high
The sound of the scribe's pen
In the stillness of the night is indeed
The heavenly muse
Uttering her immortal words


These Fevered Days -  to take them to the Forest
Where Waters cool around the mosses crawl - 
And shade is all that devastates the stillness
Seems it sometimes this would be all -This year, 
I'm raising the emotional ante, 
putting my face 
in the leaves to be stepped on, 
seeing myself among them, that is; 
that is, likening 
leaf-vein to artery, leaf to flesh, 
the passage of a leaf in autumn 
to the passage of autumn, 
branch-tip and winter spaces 
to possibilities, and possibility 
in the blowzy city of New York, 
someone has planted a gingko 
because it has leaves like fans like hands, 
hand-leaves, and sex. Those lovely 
Chinese hands on the sidewalks 
so far from delicacy 
or even, perhaps, another gender of gingko-- 
do we see them? 
No one ever treated us so gently 
as these green-going-to-yellow hands 
fanned out where we walk. 
No one ever fell down so quietly 
and lay where we would look 
when we were tired or embarrassed, 
or so bowed down by humanity 
that we had to watch out lest our shoes stumble, 
and looked down not to look up 
until something looked like parts of people 
where we were walking. We have no 
experience to make us see the gingko 
or any other tree, 
and, in our admiration for whatever grows tall
and outlives us, 
we look away, or look at the middles of things, 
which would not be our way 
if we truly thought we were gods. 

As I sit on the old chair
I look at my hand lying
On the table, both so worn
With use, and lined with age.
Both relics of a bygone era, 
Both have seen so much use.
These hands are scarred, 
Criss-crossed with reminders
Of old wounds, and old times.
These hands are old, and as I look
The steadiness fades, and they shake
Reminding me that maybe these hands, 
These ancient hands, 
Stiff hands, scarred hands, 
Old hands, and worn hands
Aren't what I remember them to be. 

These rustic tears
when they drop, 
time and place
they know not, 
sophistication
they can spell not, 
all they can be is
themselves
and the path beyond.

Caught in my palms
and my cheeks, 
in whispers they speak
glad they found a way out
now they rest; 
anguish and misery
they carry with them
leave the heart clean, 
dry and in peace.



The stars above are shining clear
So far away yet
they seem so very near
These starry sky's possess the
loveliness
That mirrors so brightly, 
within your eyes
~~
Sometimes night time clouds try
to hide my view
But their unyielding brilliance still 
shines through
~
These starry sky's oh how they
hypnotize It's true. Their beauty 
lights my most darkest 
of nights, always there reminding
me of you. 




I hate that that you made me fake a smile, a laugh.
Because of you i try my hardest to forget everything.

Your the closest thing to perfect but the farthest thing from me.

I'll never be forgivin for all my faults, by you or god or anyone.
But this I know i am not here for grace, or padon, or to give them.
My way is through shodow, blackness on the path, and in my heart, in my eyes, 
and in my soul. 

My fate unknown. 

My destiny my own.

I guess all I can do is wait for a betta day.




These tears i cry
And all the questions why
i want to be left alone
but thats inmpossibe with my feelings shown
i need to cope
but all i do is mope
the devil wears me down
so im in a constant frown
starting to lose my sense of humor
everythings so tense and gloomthese things that we support most well 
have nothing to do with up, 
and we do with them 
out of boredom or fear or money 
or cracked intelligence; 
our circle and our candle of light 
being small, 
so small we cannot bear it, 
we heave out with Idea 
and lose the Center: 
all wax without the wick, 
and we see names that once meant 
wisdom, 
like signs into ghost towns, 
and only the graves are real. 



My family is filled with crazy nuts
and they tend to like to show off their butts! 
I don't know how I've lived this long.
I cause because my mind set is strong.

This is my family's twisted game.
That's how everyone knows my name. 

My dreams so broken
My heart so empty
My hate too large 
My life so meaningless

The demon in me
Will soon be free
For once she sees me
She'll want to flee

I will slaughter 
All in sight
Making sure
She will pay

The words i heard
Tore me apart
I hate you
And always will

Once she said that
And only once
After that 
she had no chance

I Lost her forever
In a pit of rage
She had no chance
she was afraid

She died that night
From a serious cut
I had no chance
To say these words

I Love You


Tremors of your network 
cause kings to disappear. 
Your open mouth in anger 
makes nations bow in fear.

Your bombs can change the seasons, 
obliterate the spring. 
What more do you long for ? 
Why are you suffering ?

You control the human lives 
Lonely nomads wandering 
owe Telstar to you.

Seas shift at your bidding, 
your mushrooms fill the sky. 
Why are you unhappy ? 
Why do your children cry ?

They kneel alone in terror 
with dread in every glance. 
Their nights ['rights' ? - Schrift nicht lesbar] are threatened daily 
by a grim inheritance.

You dwell in whitened castles 
with deep and poisoned moats 
and cannot hear the curses 
which fill your children's throats.

  ACT I - Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus


Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with
ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
columns on the stage. Three broken pillars R. 

E.  At the back of
stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to
ascend and descend.  In the distance are the summits of adjacent
mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which
clears presently.  Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
duty as fatigued with their night's work]

CHO.  Through the night, the constellations,
    Have given light from various stations.
    When midnight gloom falls on all nations,
    We will resume our occupations.

SOLO. Our light, it's true, is not worth mention;
    What can we do to gain attention.
    When night and noon with vulgar glaring
    A great big moon is always flaring.

[During chorus, enter Diana, an elderly goddess. She is carefully
wrapped up in cloaks, shawls, etc.  A hood is over her head, a
respirator in her mouth, and galoshes on her feet. During the
chorus, she takes these things off and discovers herself dressed
in the usual costume of the Lunar Diana, the goddess of the moon.

DIA. [shuddering] Ugh. How cold the nights are.  I don't know how
it is, but I seem to feel the night air a good deal more than I
used to. But it is time for the sun to be rising. [Calls] Apollo.

AP. [within] Hollo.

DIA. I've come off duty--it's time for you to be getting up.

[Enter Apollo. He is an elderly "buck" with an air of assumed
juvenility and is dressed in dressing gown and smoking cap.

AP. [yawning] I shan't go out today. I was out yesterday and the
day before and I want a little rest. I don't know how it is,but I
seem to feel my work a great deal more than I used to.

DIA. I am sure these short days can't hurt you.  Why you don't
rise til six and you're in bed again by five; you should have a
turn at my work and see how you like that--out all night.

AP. My dear sister, I don't envy you--though I remember when I
did--but that was when I was a younger sun.  I don't think I'm
quite well.  Perhaps a little change of air will do me good. I've
a mind to show myself in London this winter. They'll be very glad
to see me. No. I shan't go out today. I shall send them this
fine, thick wholesome fog and they won't miss me.  It's the best
substitute for a blazing sun--and like most substitutes, nothing
at all like the real thing.

[Fog clears away and discovers the scene described. Hurried
music. Mercury shoots up from behind precipice at the back of
stage. He carries several parcels afterwards described.  He sits
down, very much fatigued.]

MER. Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.

DIA. You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
third time you've been out this week.

MER. Well you're a nice one to blow me up for that.

DIA. I can't help being out all night.

MER. And I can't help being down all night. The nature of Mercury
requires that he should go down when the sun sets, and rise again
when the sun rises.

DIA. And what have you been doing?

MER. Stealing on commission. There's a set of false teeth and a
of hair dye--that's for Apollo--a respirator and a pair of
galoshes--that's for Cupid--a full bottomed chignon, some
auricomous fluid, a box of pearl-powder, a pot of rouge, and a
hare's foot--that's for Venus.

DIA. Stealing. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

MER. Oh, as the god of thieves I must do something to justify my
position.

DIA. 

and AP. [contemptuously] Your position.

MER. Oh, I know it's nothing to boast of even on earth.  Up here,
it's simply contemptible.  Now that you gods are too old for your
work, you've made me the miserable drudge of Olympus--groom,
valet, postman, butler, commissionaire, maid of all work, parish
beadle, and original dustman.


MER. They ought to be but they're not.  I'm treated abominably. 
I make everybody and I'm nobody.  I go everywhere and I'm
nowhere.  I do everything and I'm nothing.  I've made thunder for
Jupiter, odes for Apollo, battles for Mars, and love for Venus. 
I've married couples for Humen and six weeks afterwards, I've
divorced them for Cupid, and in return I get all the kicks while
they pocket the halfpence. And in compensation for robbing me of
the halfpence in question, what have they done for me.

AP. Why they've--ha. 

ha. 

ha. they've made you the god of thieves.

MER. Very self denying of them.  There isn't one of them who
hasn't a better claim to the distinction than I have.

    Oh, I'm the celestial drudge,
    For morning to night I must stop at it.
    On errands all day I must trudge,
    And stick to my work til I drop at it.
    In summer I get up at one.
    (As a good-natured donkey I'm ranked for it.)
    then I go and I light up the sun.
    And Phoebus Apollo gets thanked for it.
    Well, well, it's the way of the world.
    And will be through all its futurity.
    Though noodles are baroned and earled,
    There's nothing for clever obscurity.

    And I'm bound to obey, though I rate at 'em.
    And I not only order their meals,
    But I cook 'em and serve'em and wait at 'em.
    Then I make all their nectar, I do.
    (What a terrible liquor to rack us is.)
    And whenever I mix them a brew,
    Why all the thanksgivings are Bacchus's.
    Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc.

    The reading and writing I teach.
    And spelling-books many I've edited.
    And for bringing those arts within reach,
    That donkey Minerva gets credited.
    Then I scrape at the stars with a knife,
    And plate-powder the moon (on the days for it).
    And I hear all the world and his wife
    Awarding Diana the praise for it.
    Well, well, it's the way of the world, etc

[After song--very loud and majestic music is heard]

DIA and MER [looking off] Why, who's this? Jupiter, by Jove.

[Enter Jupiter, an extremely old man, very decrepit, with very
thin straggling white beard, he wears a long braided dressing
gown, handsomely trimmed, and a silk night-cap on his head.
Mercury falls back respectfully as he enters.]

JUP. Good day, Diana.  Ah, Apollo.  Well, well, well, what's the
matter? What's the matter?

DIA. Why that young scamp Mercury says that we do nothing, and
leave all the duties of Olympus to him. Will you believe it, he
actually says that our influence on earth is dropping down to
nil.

JUP. Well, well. Don't be hard on the lad.  To tell you the
truth, I'm not sure that he's far wrong. Don't let it go any
further, but, between ourselves, the sacrifices and votive
offerings have fallen off terribly of late. Why, I can remember
the time when people offered us human sacrifices, no mistake
about it, human sacrifices.  Think of that.

DIA. Ah. Those good old days.

JUP. Then it fell off to oxen, pigs, and sheep.

AP. Well, there are worse things than oxen, pigs and sheep.

JUP. So I've found to my cost. My dear sir, between ourselves,
it's dropped off from one thing to another until it has
positively dwindled down to preserved Australian beef. What do
you think of that?

AP. I don't like it at all.

JUP. You won't mention it. It might go further.

DIA. It couldn't fare worse.

JUP. In short, matters have come to such a crisis that there's no
mistake about it--something must be done to restore our
influence, the only question is, what?

MER. [Coming forward in great alarm. Enter Mars]
    Oh incident unprecedented.
    I hardly can believe it's true.

MARS. Why, bless the boy, he's quite demented.
    Why, what's the matter, sir, with you?

AP. Speak quickly, or you'll get a warming.

MER.  Why, mortals up the mount are swarming
    Our temple on Olympus storming,
    In hundreds--aye in thousands, too.

ALL. Goodness gracious
    How audacious
    Earth is spacious
    Why come here?
    Our impeding
    Their proceeding
    Were good breeding
    That is clear.

DIA. Jupiter, hear my plea.
    Upon the mount if they light.
    There'll be an end of me.
    I won't be seen by daylight.

AP. Tartarus is the place
    These scoundrels you should send to--
    Should they behold my face.
    My influence there's an end to.

JUP. [looking over precipice]
    What fools to give themselves
    so much exertion

DIA. A government survey I'll make assertion.

AP.  Perhaps the Alpine clubs their diversion.

MER. They seem to be more like a "Cook's" excursion.

ALL. Goodness gracious, etc.

AP.  If, mighty Jove, you value your existence,
    Send them a thunderbolt with your regards.

JUP. My thunderbolts, though valid at a distance,
    Are not effective at a hundred yards.

MER. Let the moon's rays, Diana, strike 'em flighty,
    Make 'em all lunatics in various styles.

DIA. My lunar rays unhappily are mighty
    Only at many hundred thousand miles.

ALL. Goodness gracious, etc. 

[Exeunt Jupiter, Apollo, Diana, and Mercury into ruined temple]

[Enter Sparkeion and Nicemis climbing mountain at back.]

SPAR. Here we are at last on the very summit, and we've left the
others ever so far behind. Why, what's this?

NICE. A ruined palace.  A palace on the top of a mountain. I
wonder who lives here?  Some mighty kind, I dare say, with wealth
beyond all counting who came to live up here--

SPAR. To avoid his creditors. It's a lovely situation for a
country house though it's very much out of repair.

NICE. Very inconvenient situation.

SPAR. Inconvenient.

NICE. Yes, how are you to get butter, milk, and eggs up here? No
pigs, no poultry, no postman. Why, I should go mad.

SPAR. What a dear little practical mind it is. What a wife you
will make.

NICE. Don't be too sure--we are only partly married--the marriage
ceremony lasts all day.

SPAR. I have no doubt at all about it. We shall be as happy as a

NICE. It's very nice of Thespis to celebrate our marriage day by
giving the company a picnic on this lovely mountain.

SPAR. And still more kind to allow us to get so much ahead of all
the others. Discreet Thespis. [kissing her]

NICE,. There now, get away, do.  Remember the marriage ceremony
is not yet completed.

SPAR. But it would be ungrateful to Thespis's discretion not to
take advantage of it by improving the opportunity.

NICE. Certainly not; get away.

SPAR. On second thought the opportunity's so good it don't admit
of improvement. There.  [kisses her]

NICE. How dare you kiss me before we are quite married?

SPAR. Attribute it to the intoxicating influence of the mountain
air.

NICE. Then we had better do down again.  It is not right to
expose ourselves to influences over which we have no control.

SPAR. Here far away from all the world,
    Dissension and derision,
    With Nature's wonders all unfurled
    To our delighted vision,
    With no one here
    (At least in sight)
    To interfere
    With our delight,
    And two fond lovers sever,
    Oh do not free,
    Thine hand from mine,
    I swear to thee
    My love is ever thine
    For ever and for ever.

NICE. On mountain top the air is keen,
    And most exhilarating,
    And we say things we do not mean
    In moments less elating.
    So please to wait
    For thoughts that crop,
    En tete-a-tete,
    On mountain top,
    May not exactly tally
    With those that you 
    May entertain,
    Returning to
    The sober plain
    Of yon relaxing valley

SPAR. Very well--if you won't have anything to say to me, I know
who will.

NICE. Who will?

SPAR. Daphne will.

NICE. Daphne would flirt with anybody.

SPAR. Anybody would flirt with Daphne. She is quite as pretty as
you and has twice as much back-hair.

NICE. She has twice as much money, which may account for it.

SPAR. At all events, she has appreciation. She likes good looks.

NICE. We all like what we haven;t got.

SPAR. She keeps her eyes open.

NICE. Yes--one of them.

SPAR. Which one.

NICE. The one she doesn't wink with.

SPAR. Well, I was engaged to her for six months and if she still
makes eyes at me, you must attribute it to force of habit.
Besides--remember--we are only half-married at present.

NICE. I suppose you mean that you are going to treat me as
shamefully as you treated her.  Very well, break it off if you
like. I shall not offer any objection. Thespis used to be very
attentive to me. I'd just as soon be a manager's wife as a fifth-
rate actor's.

[Chorus heard, at first below, then enter Daphne, Pretteia,
Preposteros, Stupidas, Tipseion, Cymon, and other members of
Thespis's company climbing over rocks at back. All carry small
baskets.]

CHO. [with dance] Climbing over rocky mountain
    Skipping rivulet and fountain,
    Passing where the willows quiver
    By the ever rolling river,
     Swollen with the summer rain.
    Threading long and leafy mazes,
    Dotted with unnumbered daisies,
    Scaling rough and rugged passes,
    Climb the hearty lads and lasses,
    Til the mountain-top they gain.

FIRST VOICE. Fill the cup and tread the measure
    Make the most of fleeting leisure.
    Hail it as a true ally
    Though it perish bye and bye.

SECOND VOICE. Every moment brings a treasure
    Of its own especial pleasure,
    Though the moments quickly die,
    Greet them gaily as they fly.

THIRD VOICE. Far away from grief and care,
    High up in the mountain air,
    Let us live and reign alone,
    In a world that's all our own.

FOURTH VOICE. Here enthroned in the sky,
    Far away from mortal eye,
    We'll be gods and make decrees,
    Those may honor them who please.

CHO. Fill the cup and tread the measure.  

etc.

[After Chorus and Couples enter, Thespis climbing over rocks]

THES. Bless you, my people, bless you. Let the revels commence.
After all, for thorough, unconstrained unconventional enjoyment
give me a picnic.

PREP. [very gloomily] Give him a picnic, somebody.

THES. Be quiet, Preposteros. Don't interrupt.

PREP. Ha. Ha. Shut up again. But no matter.

[Stupidas endeavors, in pantomime, to reconcile him. Throughout
the scene Prep shows symptoms of breaking out into a furious
passion, and Stupidas does all he can to pacify and restrain
him.]

THES. The best of a picnic is that everybody contributes what he
pleases, and nobody knows what anybody else has brought til the
last moment. Now, unpack everybody and let's see what there is
for everybody.

NICE. I have brought you--a bottle of soda water--for the claret-
cup.

DAPH. I have brought you--lettuce for the lobster salad.

SPAR. A piece of ice--for the claret-cup.

PRETT. A bottle of vinegar--for the lobster salad.

CYMON. A bunch of burrage for the claret-cup.

TIPS. A hard boiled egg--for the lobster salad.

STUP. One lump of sugar for the claret-cup.

PREP. He has brought one lump of sugar for the claret-cup? Ha.
Ha. Ha. [laughing melodramatically]

STUP. Well, Preposteros, what have you brought?

PREP. I have brought two lumps of the very best salt for the
lobster salad.

THES. Oh--is that all?

PREP. All. Ha. Ha. He asks if it is all. {Stup. consoles him]

THES. But, I say--this is capital so far as it goes. Nothing
could be better, but it doesn't go far enough. The claret, for
instance. I don't insist on claret--or a lobster--I don't insist
on lobster, but a lobster salad without a lobster, why it isn't
lobster salad.  Here, Tipseion.

TIP. [a very drunken, bloated fellow, dressed, however, with
scrupulous accuracy and wearing a large medal around his neck] My
master. [Falls on his knees to Thes. and kisses his robe.]

THES. Get up--don't be a fool. Where's the claret? We arranged
last week that you were to see to that.

TIPS. True, dear master. But then I was a drunkard.

THES. You were.

TIPS. You engaged me to play convivial parts on the strength of
my personal appearance.

THES. I did.

TIPS. Then you found that my habits interfered with my duties as
low comedian.

THES. True.

TIPS. You said yesterday that unless I took the pledge you would
dismiss me from your company.

THES. Quite so.

TIPS. Good. I have taken it.  It is all I have taken since
yesterday. My preserver. [embraces him]

THES. Yes, but where's the wine?

TIPS. I left it behind that I might not be tempted to violate my
pledge.

PREP. Minion. [Attempts to get at him, is restrained by Stupidas]

THES. Now, Preposteros, what is the matter with you?

PREP. It is enough that I am down-trodden in my profession. I
will not submit to imposition out of it.  It is enough that as
your heavy villain I get the worst of it every night in a combat
of six.  I will not submit to insult in the day time. I have come
out. Ha. Ha. to enjoy myself.

THES. But look here, you know--virtue only triumphs at night from
seven to ten--vice gets the best of it during the other twenty
one hours.  Won't that satisfy you? [Stupidas endeavours to
pacify him.]

PREP. [Irritated to Stupidas] Ye are odious to my sight. Get out
of it.

STUP. [In great terror] What have I done?

THES. Now what is it. Preposteros, what is it?

PREP. I a -- hate him and would have his life.

THES. [to Stup.] That's it--he hates you and would have your 
life. Now go and be merry.

STUP. Yes, but why does he hate me?

THES. Oh--exactly. [to Prep.] Why do you hate him?

PREP. Because he is a minion.

THES. He hates you because you are a minion.  It explains itself. 
Now go and enjoy yourselves. Ha. Ha. It is well for those who can
laugh--let them do so--there is no extra charge.  The light-
hearted cup and the convivial jest for them--but for me--what is
there for me?

SILLI. There is some claret-cup and lobster salad [handing some]

THES. [taking it] Thank you. [Resuming] What is there for me but
anxiety--ceaseless gnawing anxiety that tears at my very vitals
and rends my peace of mind asunder?  There is nothing whatever
for me but anxiety of the nature I have just described. The
charge of these thoughtless revellers is my unhappy lot.  It is
not a small charge, and it is rightly termed a lot because there
are many. Oh why did the gods make me a manager?

SILL. [as guessing a riddle] Why did the gods make him a manager?

SPAR. Why did the gods make him a manager.

DAPH. Why did the gods make him a manager?

PRETT. Why did the gods make him a manager?

THES. No--no--what are you talking about? What do you mean?

DAPH. I've got it--no don't tell us.

ALL. No--no--because--because

THES. [annoyed] It isn't a conundrum.  It's misanthropical
question.

DAPH. [Who is sitting with Spar. to the annoyance of Nice. who is
crying alone] I'm sure I don't know. We do not want you. Don't
distress yourself on our account--we are getting on very
comfortably--aren't we Sparkeion.

SPAR. We are so happy that we don't miss the lobster or the
claret. What are lobster and claret compared with the society of
those we love? [embracing Daphne.]

DAPH. Why, Nicemis, love, you are eating nothing. Aren't you
happy dear?

NICE. [spitefully] You are quite welcome to my share of
everything. I intend to console myself with the society of my
manager. [takes Thespis' arm affectionately].

THES. Here I say--this won't do, you know--I can't allow it--at
least before my company--besides, you are half-married to
Sparkeion. Sparkeion, here's your half-wife impairing my
influence before my company. Don't you know the story of the
gentleman who undermined his influence by associating with his
inferiors?

ALL. Yes, yes--we know it.

PREP. [formally] I do not know it. It's ever thus. Doomed to
disappointment from my earliest years.  [Stup. endeavours to
console him] 

THES. There--that's enough.  Preposteros--you shall hear it.

I once knew a chap who discharged a function
On the North South East West Diddlesex Junction.
He was conspicuous exceeding,
For his affable ways, and his easy breeding.
Although a chairman of directions,
He was hand in glove with the ticket inspectors.
He tipped the guards with brand new fivers,
And sang little songs to the engine drivers.
'Twas told to me with great compunction,
By one who had discharged with unction
A chairman of directors function
On the North South East West Diddlesex Junction.
Fol diddle, lol diddle, lol lol lay.

A silver shovel and a golden poker.
He'd button holw flowers for the ticket sorters
And rich Bath-buns for the outside porters.
He'd moun the clerks on his first-class hunters,
And he build little villas for the road-side shunters,
And if any were fond of pigeon shooting,
He'd ask them down to his place at Tooting.
Twas told to me. . 

etc.

In course of time there spread a rumour
That he did all this from a sense of humour.
So instead of signalling and stoking,
They gave themselves up to a course of joking.
Whenever they knew that he was riding,
They shunted his train on a lonely siding,
Or stopped all night in the middle of a tunnel,
On the plea that the boiler was a-coming through the funnel.
Twas told to me.  

etc.

It he wished to go to Perth or Stirling,
His train through several counties whirling,
Would set him down in a fit of larking,
At four a. 

m. in the wilds of Barking.
This pleased his whim and seemed to strike it,
But the general public did not like it.
The receipts fell, after a few repeatings,
And he got it hot at the annual meetings.
Twas told to me.  

etc.

He followed out his whim with vigour,
The shares went down to a nominal figure.
These are the sad results proceeding
From his affable ways and his easy breeding.
The line, with its rais and guards and peelers,
Was sold for a song to marine store dealers
The shareholders are all in the work'us,
And he sells pipe-lights in the Regent Circus.
Twas told to me.  

etc.

It's very hard. As a man I am naturally of an easy disposition.
As a manager, I am compelled to hold myself aloof, that my
influence may not be deteriorated.  As a man I am inclined to
fraternize with the pauper--as a manager I am compelled to walk
around like this: Don't know yah. Don't know yah. Don't know yah.

[Strides haughtily about the stage. Jupiter, Mars, and Apollo, in
full Olympian costume appear on the three broken columns.
Thespians scream.]

JUP, MARS, AP. Presumptuous mortal.

THES. Don't know ya. Don't know yah.

JUP, MARS, AP. [seated on broken pillars] Presumptuous mortal.

THES. I do not know you. I do not know you.

JUP, MARS, AP. Presumptuous mortal.

THES. Remove this person.

[Stup and Prep seize Ap and Mars]

JUP. Stop, you evidently don't know me.  Allow me to offer you my
card. [Throws flash paper]

THES. Ah yes, it's very pretty, but we don't want any at present.
manner] Look here, you know this is a private party and we
haven't the pleasure of your acquaintance. There are a good many
other mountains about, if you must have a mountain all to
yourself. Don't make me let myself down before my company.
[Resuming] Don't know yah, Don't know yah.

JUP. I am Jupiter, the king of the gods. This is Apollo. This is
Mars. [All kneel to them except Thespis]

THES. Oh. Then as I'm a respectable man, and rather particular
about the company I keep, I think I'll go.

JUP. No--no--stop a bit. We want to consult you on a matter of
great importance. There. Now we are alone. Who are you?

THES. I am Thespis of the Thessalian Theatres.

JUP. The very man we want. Now as a judge of what the public
likes are you impressed with my appearance as father of the gods?

THES. Well to be candid with you, I am not. In fact I'm
disappointed.

JUP. Disappointed?

THES. Yes, you see you're so much out of repair. No, you don't
come up to my idea of the part. Bless you, I've played you often.

JUP. You have.

THES. To be sure I have.

JUP. And how have you dressed the part.

THES. Fine commanding party in the prime of life. Thunderbolt--
full beard--dignified manner--a good eal of this sort of thin
"Don't know ya. Don't know yah. Don't know yah.

JUP. [much affected] I--I'm very much obliged to you. It's very
good of you. I--I--I used to be like that. I can't tell you how
much I feel it. And do you find I'm an impressive character to
play?

THES. Well no, I can't say you are.  In fact we don't you you
much out of burlesque.

JUP. Burlesque!

THES. Yes, it's a painful subject, drop it, drop it.  The fact
is, you are not the gods you were--you're behind your age.

JUP. Well, but what are we to do? We feel that we ought to do
something, but we don't know what.

THES. Why don't you all go down to earth, incog, mingle with the
world, hear and see what people think of you, and judge for
yourselves as to the best means to take to restore your
influence?

JUP. Ah, but what's to become of Olympus in the meantime?

THES. Lor' bless you, don't distress yourself about that. I've a
very good company, used to take long parts on the shortest
notice. Invest us with your powers and we'll fill your places
till you return.

JUP. [aside] The offer is tempting. But suppose you fail?

THES. Fail. Oh, we never fail in our profession. We've nothing
but great successes.

JUP. Then it's a bargain.

THES. It's a bargain. [they shake hands on it]

JUP. And that you may not be entirely without assistance, we will
leave you Mercury and whenever you find yourself in a difficulty
you can consult him.  [enter Mercury]

JUP.  So that's arranged--you take my place, my boy,
    While we make trial of a new existence.
    At length I will be able to enjoy
    The pleasures I have envied from a distance.

MER.  Compelled upon Olympus here to stop,
    While the other gods go down to play the hero.
    Don't be surprised if on this mountain top
    You find your Mercury is down at zero.

AP.  To earth away to join in mortal acts.
    And gather fresh materials to write on.
    Investigate more closely, several facts,
    That I for centuries have thrown some light on.

DIA. I, as the modest moon with crescent bow.
    Have always shown a light to nightly scandal,
    I must say I'd like to go below,
    And find out if the game is worth the candle.

[enter all thespians, summoned by Mercury]

MER. Here come your people.

THES. People better now.

THES. While mighty Jove goes down below
    With all the other deities.
    I fill his place and wear his "clo,"
    The very part for me it is.
    To mother earth to make a track,
    They are all spurred and booted, too.
    And you will fill, till they come back,
    The parts you best are suited to.

CHO. Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys
    Mortals are about to personate the gods and goddesses.
    Now to set the world in order, we will work in unity.
    Jupiter's perplexity is Thespis's opportunity.

SPAR. Phoebus am I, with golden ray,
    The god of day, the god of day.
    When shadowy night has held her sway,
    I make the goddesses fly.
    Tis mine the task to wake the world,
    In slumber curled, in slumber curled.
    By me her charms are all unfurled
    The god of day am I.

CHO. The god of day, the god of day,
    The park shall our Sparkeion play,
    Ha Ha, etc.
    The rarest fun and rarest fare
    That ever fell to mortal share
    Ha ha etc.

NICE. I am the moon, the lamp of night.
    I show a light -- I show a light.
    With radiant sheen I put to flight
    The shadows of the sky.
    By my fair rays, as you're aware,
    Gay lovers swear--gay lovers swear,
    While greybeards sleep away their care,
    The lamp of night am I.

CHO. The lamp of night-the lamp of night.
    Nicemis plays, to her delight.
    Ha Ha Ha Ha.
    The rarest fun and rarest fare,
    That ever fell to mortal share,
    Ha Ha Ha Ha

TIM. Mighty old Mars, the god of war,
    I'm destined for--I'm destined for.
    A terribly famous conqueror,
    With sword upon his thigh.
    When armies meet with eager shout
    And warlike rout, and warlike rout,
    You'll find me there without a doubt.

CHO. The god of war, the god of war
    Great Timidon is destined for.
    Ha Ha Ha Ha
    The rest fun and rarest fare
    That ever fell to mortal share
    Ha Ha Ha Ha

DAPH. When, as the fruit of warlike deeds,
    The soldier bleed, the soldier bleeds,
    Calliope crowns heroic deeds,
    With immortality.
    From mere oblivion I reclaim
    The soldier's name, the soldier's name
    And write it on the roll of fame,
    The muse of fame am I.

CHO. The muse of fame, the muse of fame.
    Callipe is Daphne's name.
    Ha Ha Ha Ha
    The rarest fun and rarest fare,
    That ever fell to mortal share.
    Ha Ha Ha Ha.

TUTTI. Here's a pretty tale.

   ACT II - The same Scene, with the Ruins Restored


SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
back. High throne. L. 

U. 

E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.

CHO. Of all symposia
    The best by half
    Upon Olympus, here await us.
    We eat ambrosia.
    And nectar quaff,
    It cheers but don't inebriate us.
    We know the fallacies,
    Of human food
    So please to pass Olympian rosy,
    We built up palaces,
    Where ruins stood,
    And find them much more snug and cosy.

SILL. To work and think, my dear,
    Up here would be,
    The height of conscientious folly.
    So eat and drink, my dear,
    I like to see,
    Young people gay--young people jolly.
    Olympian food my love,
    I'll lay long odds,
    Will please your lips--those rosy portals,
    What is the good, my love
    Of being gods,
    If we must work like common mortals?

CHO. Of all symposia.  

etc.

[Exeunt all but Nicemis, who is dressed as Diana and Pretteia,
who is dressed as Venus. They take Sillimon's arm and bring him
down]

SILL. Bless their little hearts, I can refuse them nothing. As
the Olympian stage-manager I ought to be strict with them and
make them do their duty, but i can't.  Bless their little hearts,
when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
wheedling smile on their pretty little figure-heads, I can't turn
my back on 'em.  I'm all bow, though I'm sure I try to be stern.

PRET. You certainly are a dear old thing.

SILL. She says I'm a dear old thing.  Deputy Venus says I'm a
dear old thing.

NICE. It's her affectionate habit to describe everybody in those
terms. I am more particular, but still even I am bound to admit
that you are certainly a very dear old thing.

SILL. Deputy Venus says I'm a dear old thing, and Deputy Diana
who is much more particular, endorses it. Who could be severe
with such deputy divinities.

PRET. Do you know, I'm going to ask you a favour.

SILL. Venus is going to ask me a favour.

PRET. You see, I am Venus.

SILL. No one who saw your face would doubt it.

NICE. [aside] No one who knew her character would.

PRET. Well Venus, you know, is married to Mars.

SILL. To Vulcan, my dear, to Vulcan. The exact connubial relation
of the different gods and goddesses is a point on which we must
be extremely particular.

PRET. I beg your pardon--Venus is married to Mars.

NICE. If she isn't married to Mars, she ought to be.

SILL. Then that decides it--call it married to Mars.

PRET. Married to Vulcan or married to Mars, what does it signify?

SILL. My dear, it's a matter on which I have no personal feeling
whatever.

PRET. So that she is married to someone.

SILL. Exactly. So that she is married to someone. Call it married
to Mars.

PRET. Now here's my difficulty. Presumptios takes the place of
Mars, and Presumptios is my father.

SILL. Then why object to Vulcan?

PRET. Because Vulcan is my grandfather.

SILL. But, my dear, what an objection. You are playing a part
till the real gods return. That's all.  Whether you are supposed
to be married to your father--or your grandfather, what does it
matter? This passion for realism is the curse of the stage.

PRET. That's all very well, but I can't throw myself into a part
that has already lasted a twelvemonth, when I have to make love
to my father.  It interferes with my conception of the
characters. It spoils the part.

SILL. Well, well. I'll see what can be done. [Exit Pretteia,
L. 

U. 

E.) That's always the way with beginners, they've no
imaginative power.  A true artist ought to be superior to such
considerations. [Nicemis comes down R.] Well, Nicemis, I should
say, Diana, what's wrong with you? Don't you like your part?

NICE. Oh, immensely. It's great fun.

SILL. Don't you find it lonely out by yourself all night?

NICE. Oh, but I'm not alone all night.

SILL. But, I don't want to ask any injudicious questions, but who
accompanies you?

NICE. Who? Why Sparkeion, of course.

SILL. Sparkeion? Well, but Sparkeion is Phoebus Apollo [enter
Sparkeion] He's the sun, you know.

NICE. Of course he is.  I should catch my death of cold, in the
night air, if he didn't accompany me.

SPAR. My dear Sillimon, it would never do for a young lady to be
out alone all night. It wouldn't be respectable.

SILL. There's a good deal of truth in that.  But still--the sun--
at night--I don't like the idea.  The original Diana always went
out alone.

NICE. I hope the original Diana is no rule for me. After all,
what does it matter?

SILL. To be sure--what does it matter?

SPAR. The sun at night, or in the daytime.

SILL. So that he shines. That's all that's necessary. [Exit
Nicemis, R. 

U. 

E.] But poor Daphne, what will she say to this.

SPAR. Oh, Daphne can console herself; young ladies soon get over
this sort of thing. Did you never hear of the young lady who was
engaged to Cousin Robin?

SILL. Never.

SPAR. Then I'll sing it to you.

    Little maid of Arcadee
    Sat on Cousin Robin's knee,
    Thought in form and face and limb,
    Nobody could rival him.
    He was brave and she was fair,
    Truth they made a pretty paid.
    Happy little maiden she--
    Happy maid of Arcadee.

    Moments fled as moments will  
    Happily enough, until
    After, say, a month or two,
    Robin did as Robins do.
    Weary of his lover's play,
    Jilted her and went away,
    Wretched little maiden, she--
    Wretched maid of Arcadee.

    To her little home she crept,
    There she sat her down and wept,
    Maiden wept as maidens will--
    Grew so thin and pale--until
    Cousin Richard came to woo.
    Then again the roses grew.
    Happy little maiden she--
    Happy maid of Arcadee.   [Exit Sparkeion]

SILL. Well Mercury, my boy, you've had a year's experience of us
here. How do we do it? I think we're rather an improvement on the
original gods--don't you?

MER. Well, you see, there's a good deal to be said on both sides
of the question; you are certainly younger than the original
gods, and, therefore, more active.  On the other hand, they are
certainly older than you, and have, therefore, more experience.
On the whole I prefer you, because your mistakes amuse me.

Olympus is now in a terrible muddle,
The deputy deities all are at fault
They splutter and splash like a pig in a puddle
And dickens a one of 'em's earning his salt.
For Thespis as Jove is a terrible blunder,
Too nervous and timid--too easy and weak--
Whenever he's called on to lighten or thunder,
The thought of it keeps him awake for a week.

Then mighty Mars hasn't the pluck of a parrot.
When left in the dark he will quiver and quail;
And Vulcan has arms that would snap like a carrot,
Before he could drive in a tenpenny nail.
Then Venus's freckles are very repelling,
And Venus should not have a quint in her eyes;
The learned Minerva is weak in her spelling,
And scatters her h's all over the skies.

Then Pluto in kindhearted tenderness erring,
Can't make up his mind to let anyone die--
The Times has a paragraph ever recurring,
"Remarkable incidence of longevity

"
On some it has some as a serious onus,
to others it's quite an advantage--in short,
While ev're life office declares a big bonus,
The poor undertakers are all in the court.

Then Cupid, the rascal, forgetting his trade is
To make men and women impartially smart,
Will only shoot at pretty young ladies,
And never takes aim at a bachelor's heart.
The results of this freak--or whatever you term it--
Should cover the wicked young scamp with disgrace,
While ev'ry young man is as shy as a hermit,
Young ladies are popping all over the place.

This wouldn't much matter--for bashful and shymen,
When skillfully handled are certain to fall,
But, alas, that determined young bachelor Hymen
Refuses to wed anybody at all.
He swears that Love's flame is the vilest of arsons,
And looks upon marriage as quite a mistake;
Now what in the world's to become of the parsons,
And what of the artist who sugars the cake?

In short, you will see from the facts that I'm showing,
The state of the case is exceedingly sad;
If Thespis's people go on as they're going,
Olympus will certainly go to the bad.
From Jupiter downward there isn't a dab in it,
All of 'em quibble and shuffle and shirk,
A premier in Downing Street forming a cabinet,
Couldn't find people less fit for their work.

[enter Thespis L. 

U. 

E.]

THES. Sillimon, you can retire.

SILL. Sir, I--

THES. Don't pretend you can't when I say you can. I've seen you
do it--go. [exit Sillimon bowing extravagantly. Thespis imitates
him]Well, Mercury, I've been in power one year today.

MER. One year today. How do you like ruling the world?

THES. Like it.  Why it's as straightforward as possible. Why
there hasn't been a hitch of any kind since we came up here. Lor'
the airs you gods and goddesses give yourselves are perfectly
sickening. Why it's mere child's play.

MER. Very simple isn't it?

THES. Simple? Why I could do it on my head.

MER. Ah--I darsay you will do it on your head very soon.

THES. What do you mean by that, Mercury?

MER. I mean that when you've turned the world quite topsy-turvy
you won't know whether you're standing on your head or your
heels.

THES. Well, but Mercury, it's all right at present.

MER. Oh yes--as far as we know.

THES. Well, but, you know, we know as much as anybody knows; you
know I believe the world's still going on.

MER. Yes--as far as we can judge--much as usual.

THES. Well, the, give the Father of the Drama his due Mercury. 
Don't be envious of the Father of the Drama.

MER. But you see you leave so much to accident.

THES. Well, Mercury, if I do, it's my principle. I am an easy
man, and I like to make things as pleasant as possible. What did
I do the day we took office?  Why I called the company together
and I said to them: "Here we are, you know, gods and goddesses,
no mistake about it, the real thing. Well, we have certain duties
to discharge, let's discharge them intelligently. Don't let us be
hampered by routine and red tape and precedent, let's set the
original gods an example, and put a liberal interpretation on our
duties.  If it occurs to any one to try an experiment in his own
department, let him try it, if he fails there's no harm done, if
he succeeds it is a distinct gain to society. Don't hurry your
work, do it slowly and well

" And here we are after a twelvemonth
and not a single complaint or a single petition has reached me.

MER. No, not yet.

THES. What do you mean by "no,not yet?"

MER. Well, you see, you don't understand things. All the
petitions that are addressed by men to Jupiter pass through my
hands, and its my duty to collect them and present them once a
year.

THES. Oh, only once a year?

MER. Only once a year--

THES. And the year is up?

MER. Today.

THES. Oh, then I suppose there are some complaints?

MER. Yes, there are some.

THES. [Disturbed] Oh, perhaps there are a good many?

MER. There are a good many.

THES. Oh, perhaps there are a thundering lot?

MER. There are a thundering lot.

THES. [very much disturbed] Oh.

MER. You see you've been taking it so very easy--and so have most
of your company.

THES. Oh, who has been taking it easy?

MER. Well, all except those who have been trying experiments.

THES. Well but I suppose the experiment are ingenious?

MER. Yes; they are ingenious, but on the whole ill-judged. But
it's time go and summon your court.

THES. What for.

MER. To hear the complaints.  In five minutes they will be here.
[Exit]

THES. [very uneasy] I don't know how it is, but there is
something in that young man's manner that suggests that the
father of the gods has been taking it too easy.  Perhaps it would
have been better if I hadn't given my company so much scope. I
wonder what they've been doing. I think I will curtail their
discretion, though none of them appear to have much of the
article.  It seems a pity to deprive 'em of what little they
have.

[Enter Daphne, weeping]

THES. Now then, Daphne, what's the matter with you?

DAPH. Well, you know how disgracefully Sparkeion--

THES. [correcting her] Apollo--

DAPH. Apollo, then--has treated me. He promised to marry me years
ago and now he's married to Nicemis.

THES. Now look here. I can't go into that. You're in Olympus now
and must behave accordingly. Drop your Daphne--assume your
Calliope.

DAPH. Quite so. That's it. [mysteriously]

THES. Oh--that is it? [puzzled]

DAPH. That is it. Thespis.  I am Calliope, the muse of fame. 
Very good. This morning I was in the Olympian library and I took
down the only book there.  Here it is.

THES. [taking it] Lempriere's Classical Dictionary. The Olympian
Peerage.

DAPH. Open it at Apollo.

THES. [opens it] It is done.

DAPH. Read.

THES. "Apollo was several times married, among others to Issa,
Bolina, Coronis, Chymene, Cyrene, Chione, Acacallis, and
Calliope


DAPH. And Calliope.

THES. [musing] Ha. I didn't know he was married to them.

DAPH. [severely] Sir. This is the family edition.

THES. Quite so.

DAPH. You couldn't expect a lady to read any other?

THES. On no consideration. But in the original version--

DAPH. I go by the family edition.

THES. Then by the family edition, Apollo is your husband.

[Enter Nicemis and Sparkeion]

NICE. Apollo your husband? He is my husband.

DAPH. I beg your pardon. He is my husband.

NICE. Apollo is Sparkeion, and he's married to me.

DAPH. Sparkeion is Apollo, and he's married to me.

NICE. He is my husband.

DAPH. He's your brother.

THES. Look here, Apollo, whose husband are you?  Don't let's have
any row about it; whose husband are you?

SPAR. Upon my honor I don't know. I'm in a very delicate
position, but I'll fall in with any arrangement Thespis may
propose.

DAPH. I've just found out that he's my husband and yet he goes
out every evening with that "thing


THES. Perhaps he's trying an experiment.

DAPH. I don't like my husband to make such experiments. The
question is, who are we all and what is our relation to each
other.

SPAR. You're Diana. I'm Apollo
    And Calliope is she.

DAPH. He's your brother.

NICE. You're another.  He has fairly married me.

DAPH. By the rules of this fair spot
    I'm his wife and you are not.

SPAR & DAPH.  By the rules of this fair spot
    I'm/she's his wife and you are not.

NICE. By this golden wedding ring,
    I'm his wife, and you're a "thing


DAPH, NICE, SPAR. By this golden wedding ring,
    I'm/She's his wife and you're a "thing


ALL. Please will someone kindly tell us.
    Who are our respective kin?
    All of us/them are very jealous
    Neither of us/them will give in.

NICE. He's my husband, I declare,
    I espoused him properlee.

SPAR. That is true, for I was there,
    And I saw her marry me.

DAPH. He's your brother--I'm his wife.
    If we go by Lempriere.

SPAR. So she is, upon my life.
    Really, that seems very fair.

NICE. You're my husband and no other.

SPAR. That is true enough I swear.

DAPH. I'm his wife, and you're his brother.

SPAR. If we go by Lempriere.

NICE. It will surely be unfair,
    To decide by Lempriere. [crying]

DAPH. It will surely be quite fair,
    To decide by Lempriere.

SPAR & THES How you settle it I don't care,
    Leave it all to Lempriere.
    [Spoken] The Verdict
    As Sparkeion is Apollo,
    Up in this Olympian clime,
    Why, Nicemis, it will follow,
    He's her husband, for the time. [indicating Daphne]

    When Sparkeion turns to mortal
    Join once more the sons of men.
    He may take you to his portal [indicating Nicemis]
    He will be your husband then.
    That oh that is my decision,
    'Cording to my mental vision,
    Put an end to all collision,
    My decision, my decision.

ALL. That oh that is his decision. etc.

[Exeunt Thes, Nice., Spar and Daphne, Spar. with Daphne, Nicemis
weeping with Thespis.  mysterious music. Enter Jupiter, Apollo
and Mars from below, at the back of stage. All wear cloaks, as
disguise and all are masked]

JUP., AP., MARS. Oh rage and fury, Oh shame and sorrow.
    We'll be resuming our ranks tomorrow.
    Since from Olympus we have departed,
    We've been distracted and brokenhearted,
    Oh wicked Thespis. Oh villain scurvy.
    Through him Olympus is topsy turvy.
    Compelled to silence to grin and bear it.
    He's caused our sorrow, and he shall share it.
    Where is the monster. Avenge his blunders.
    He has awakened Olympian thunders.

[Enter Mercury]

JUP. Oh monster.

AP. Oh monster.

MARS. Oh monster.

MER. [in great terror] Please sir, what have I done, sir?

JUP. What did we leave you behind for?

MER. Please sir, that's the question I asked for when you went
away.

JUP. Was it not that Thespis might consult you whenever he was in
a difficulty?

MER. Well, here I've been ready to be consulted, chockful of
reliable information--running over with celestial maxims--advice
gratis ten to four--after twelve ring the night bell in cases of
emergency.

JUP. And hasn't he consulted you?

MER. Not he--he disagrees with me about everything.

JUP. He must have misunderstood me.  I told him to consult you
whenever he was in a fix.

MER. He must have though you said in-sult.  Why whenever I opened
my mouth he jumps down my throat.  It isn't pleasant to have a
fellow constantly jumping down your throat--especially when he
always disagrees with you. It's just the sort of thing I can't
digest.

JUP. [in a rage] Send him here.  I'll talk to him.

[enter Thespis. He is much terrified]

JUP. Oh monster.

AP. Oh monster.

MARS. Oh monster.

[Thespis sings in great terror, which he endeavours to conceal]

JUP. Well sir, the year is up today.

AP. And a nice mess you've made of it.

MARS. You've deranged the whole scheme of society.

THES. [aside] There's going to be a row. [aloud and very
familiarly]My dear boy, I do assure you--

JUP. Be respectful.

AP. Be respectful.

MARS. Be respectful.

THES. I don't know what you allude to. With the exception of
getting our scene painter to "run up" this temple, because we
found the ruins draughty, we haven't touched a thing.

JUP. Oh story teller.

AP. Oh story teller.

MARS. Oh story teller.

[Enter thespians]

THES. My dear fellows, you're distressing yourselves
unnecessarily. The court of Olympus is about to assemble to
listen to the complaints of the year, if any.  But there are
none, or next to none.  Let the Olympians assemble.  [Thespis
takes chair.  JUP., AP., and MARS sit below him.

Ladies and gentlemen, it seems that it is usual for the gods to
assemble once a year to listen to mortal petitions. It doesn't
seem to me to be a good plan, as work is liable to accumulate;
but as I am particularly anxious not to interfere with Olympian
precedent, but to allow everything to go on as it has always been
accustomed to go--why, we'll say no more about it. [aside] But
how shall I account for your presence?

JUP. Say we are the gentlemen of the press.

THES. That all our proceedings may be perfectly open and above-
board I have communicated with the most influential members of
the Athenian press, and I beg to introduce to your notice three
of its most distinguished members.  They bear marks emblematic of
the anonymous character of modern journalism. [Business of
introduction. Thespis is very uneasy]  Now then, if you're all
ready we will begin.

MER. [brings tremendous bundle of petitions] Here is the agenda.

THES. What's that?  The petitions?

MER. Some of them. [opens one and reads] Ah, I thought there'd be
a row about it.

THES. Why, what's wrong now?

MER. Why, it's been a foggy Friday in November for the last six
months and the Athenians are tired of it.

THES. There's no pleasing some people. This craving for perpetual
change is the curse of the country. Friday's a very nice day.

MER. So it is, but a Friday six months long.--it gets monotonous.

JUP, AP, MARS. [rising] It's perfectly ridiculous.

THES. [calling them] Cymon.

CYM. [as time with the usual attributes] Sir.

THES. [Introducing him to the three gods] Allow me--Father Time--
rather young at present but even time must have a beginning.  In
course of time, time will grow older.  Now then, Father Time,
what's this about a wet Friday in November for the last six
months.

CYM. Well, the fact is, I've been trying an experiment. Seven
days in the week is an awkward number. It can't be halved. Two;'s
into seven won't go.

THES. [tries it on his fingers] Quite so--quite so.

CYM. So I abolished Saturday.

JUP, AP, MARS. Oh but. [Rising]

THES. Do be quiet. He's a very intelligent young man and knows
what he is about. So you abolished Saturday. And how did you find
it answer?

CYM. Admirably.

THES. You hear? He found it answer admirably.

CYM. Yes, only Sunday refused to take its place.

THES. Sunday refused to take its place?

CYM. Sunday comes after Saturday--Sunday won't go on duty after
Friday. Sunday's principles are very strict. That's where my
experiment sticks.

THES. Well, but why November? Come, why November?

CYM. December can't begin until November has finished.  November
can't finish because he's abolished Saturday. There again my
experiment sticks.

THES. Well, but why wet? Come now, why wet?

CYM. Ah, that is your fault. You turned on the rain six months
ago and you forgot to turn it off again.

JUP., AP., MARS. [rising] On this is monstrous.

ALL. Order. Order.

THES. Gentlemen, pray be seated. [to the others] The liberty of
the press, one can't help it. [to the three gods] It is easily
settled. Athens has had a wet Friday in November for the last six
months.  Let them have a blazing Tuesday in July for the next
twelve.

JUP., AP., MARS. But--

ALL. Order. Order.

THES. Now then, the next article.

MER. Here's a petition from the Peace Society. They complain
because there are no more battles.

MARS. [springing up] What.

THES. Quiet there. Good dog--soho; Timidon.

TIM. [as Mars] Here.

THES. What's this about there being no battles?

TIM. I've abolished battles; it's an experiment.

MARS. [spring up] Oh come, I say--

THES. Quiet then. [to Tim] Abolished battles?

TIM. Yes, you told us on taking office to remember two things. To
try experiments and to take it easy. I found I couldn't take it
easy while there are any battles to attend to, so I tried the
experiment and abolished battles. And then I took it easy. The
Peace Society ought to be very much obliged to me.

THES. Obliged to you. Why, confound it. Since battles have been
abolished, war is universal.

TIM. War is universal?

THES. To b sure it is. Now that nations can't fight, no two of
'em are on speaking terms. The dread of fighting was the only
thing that kept them civil to each other.  Let battles be
restored and peace reign supreme.

MER. Here's a petition from the associated wine merchants of
Mytilene? Are there no grapes this year?

THES. Well, what's wrong with the associated wine merchants of
Mytilene?  Are there no grapes this year?

THES. Plenty of grapes. More than usual.

THES. [to the gods] You observe, there is no deception. There are
more than usual.

MER. There are plenty of grapes, only they are full of ginger
beer.


THES. Eh? what [much alarmed] Bacchus.

TIPS. [as Bacchus] Here. 

THES. There seems to be something unusual with the grapes of
Mytilene. They only grow ginger beer.

TIPS. And a very good thing too.

THES. It's very nice in its way but it is not what one looks for
from grapes.

TIPS. Beloved master, a week before we came up here, you insisted
on my taking the pledge. By so doing you rescued me from my
otherwise inevitable misery. I cannot express my thanks. Embrace
me. [attempts to embrace him.]

THES. Get out, don't be a fool. Look here, you know you're the
god of wine.

TIPS. I am.

THES. [very angry] Well, do you consider it consistent with your
duty as the god of wine to make the grapes yield nothing but
ginger beer?

TIPS. Do you consider it consistent with my duty as a total
abstainer to grow anything stronger than ginger beer?

THES. But your duty as the god of wine--

TIPS. In every respect in which my duty as the god of wine can be
discharged consistently with my duty as a total abstainer, I will
discharge it.  But when the functions clash, everything must give
way to the pledge.  My preserver. [Attempts to embrace him]

THES. Don't be a confounded fool. This can be arranged. We can't
give over the wine this year, but at least we can improve the
ginger beer.  Let all the ginger beer be extracted from it
immediately.

    We can't stand this.
    It's much too strong.
    We can't stand this.
    It would be wrong.
    Extremely wrong.
    If we stood this.
 
    If we stand this
    If we stand this
    We can't stand this.

DAPH, SPAR, NICE. Great Jove, this interference.
    Is more than we can stand;
    Of them make a clearance,
    With your majestic hand.

JOVE. This cool audacity, it beats us hollow.
    I'm Jupiter.

MARS. I'm Mars.

AP. I'm Apollo.

[Enter Diana and all the other gods and goddesses.

ALL. [kneeling with their foreheads on the ground]

    Jupiter, Mars, and Apollo
    Have quitted the dwellings of men;
    The other gods quickly will follow.
    And what will become of us then.
    Oh pardon us, Jove and Apollo,
    Pardon us, Jupiter, Mars:
    Oh see us in misery wallow.
    Cursing our terrible stars.

[enter other gods.]

ALL THESPIANS: Let us remain, we beg of you pleadingly.


THES. Life on Olympus suits us exceedingly.


THES. Let us remain, we pray in humility.


THES. If we have shown some little ability.

    Let us remain, etc. 

JUP. Enough, your reign is ended.
    Upon this sacred hill.
    Let him be apprehended 
    And learn out awful will.
    Away to earth, contemptible comedians,
    And hear our curse, before we set you free'
    You shall be all be eminent tragedians,
    Whom no one ever goes to see.

ALL. We go to earth, contemptible tragedians,
    We hear his curse, before he sets us free,
    We shall all be eminent tragedians,
    Whom no one ever, ever goes to see.

SILL, SPAR, THES. Whom no one
    Ever goes to see.

[The thespians are driven away by the gods, who group themselves
in attitudes of triumph.]

THES. Now, here you see the arrant folly
    Of doing your best to make things jolly.
    I've ruled the world like a chap in his senses,
    Observe the terrible consequences.
    Great Jupiter, whom nothing pleases,
    Splutters and swears, and kicks up breezes,
    And sends us home in a mood avengin'
    In double quick time, like a railroad engine.
    And this he does without compunction,
    Because I have discharged with unction
    A highly complicated function
    Complying with his own injunction,
    Fol, lol, lay

CHO. All this he does. . 

etc.

[The gods drive the thespians away. The thespians prepare to
descend the mountain as the curtain falls.]

They all want to play Hamlet. 
They have not exactly seen their fathers killed 
Nor their mothers in a frame-up to kill, 
Nor an Ophelia lying with dust gagging the heart, 
Not exactly the spinning circles of singing golden spiders, 
Not exactly this have they got at nor the meaning of flowers--O flowers, flowers slung by a dancing girl--in the saddest play the inkfish, Shakespeare ever wrote; 
Yet they all want to play Hamlet because it is sad like all actors are sad and to stand by an open grave with a joker's skull in the hand and then to say over slow and over slow wise, keen, beautiful words asking the heart that's breaking, breaking, 
This is something that calls and calls to their blood. 
They are acting when they talk about it and they know it is acting to be particular about it and yet: They all want to play Hamlet.They are all gone into the world of light!
And I alone sit ling'ring here;
Their very memory is fair and bright,
And my sad thoughts doth clear.

It glows and glitters in my cloudy breast,
Like stars upon some gloomy grove,
Or those faint beams in which this hill is drest,
After the sun's remove.

I see them walking in an air of glory,
Whose light doth trample on my days:
My days, which are at best but dull and hoary,
Mere glimmering and decays.

O holy Hope! and high Humility,
High as the heavens above!
These are your walks, and you have show'd them me
To kindle my cold love.

Dear, beauteous Death! the jewel of the just,
Shining nowhere, but in the dark;
What mysteries do lie beyond thy dust
Could man outlook that mark!

He that hath found some fledg'd bird's nest, may know
At first sight, if the bird be flown;
But what fair well or grove he sings in now,
That is to him unknown.

And yet as angels in some brighter dreams
Call to the soul, when man doth sleep:
So some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes
And into glory peep.

If a star were confin'd into a tomb,
Her captive flames must needs burn there;
But when the hand that lock'd her up, gives room,
She'll shine through all the sphere.

O Father of eternal life, and all
Created glories under thee!
Resume thy spirit from this world of thrall
Into true liberty.

Either disperse these mists, which blot and fill
My perspective still as they pass,
Or else remove me hence unto that hill,
Where I shall need no glass. 

We are the farmers students labourers 
Who died in both world wars.
 
We are the soldiers from many countries, 
who fought in obscure wars for no real reasons.
 
We are the disappeared of the Revolutions In
Africa Europe and Asia who fought for freedom.
 
We are the departed Egyptian Libyan Syrians 
Who gave all in the rise of the Arab Spring.
 
We are the fruit sellar and monks who immolated
Themselves in dispair about poverty and for freedom.
 
We are the workers who fight for a just wage
and are gunned down by the system.
 
They are the ones who call us to stay awake
And pray that we do not fall asleep again.
 
They are calling you and me to take a stand. Now! 
To be counted among those who will not sleep

AM I the river your white birds fly over?
Are you the green valley my silver channels roam?
The two of us a bowl of blue sky day time and a bowl of red stars night time?
  Who picked you
  out of the first great whirl of nothings
  and threw you here

THE FINE cloth of your love might be a fabric of Egypt,
Something Sinbad, the sailor, took away from robbers,
Something a traveler with plenty of money might pick up
And bring home and stick on the walls and say:
'There's a little thing made a hit with me
When I was in Cairo-I think I must see Cairo again some day.'
So there are cornice manufacturers, chewing gum kings,
Young Napoleons who corner eggs or corner cheese,
Phenoms looking for more worlds to corner,
And still other phenoms who lard themselves in
And make a killing in steel, copper, permanganese,
And they say to random friends in for a call:
  'Have you had a look at my wife? Here she is.
Haven't I got her dolled up for fair?'
O-ee! the fine cloth of your love might be a fabric of Egypt.

The pride of a scholar
Is not much in what they attain in paper
The pride of a scholar is in
How they bring change around them and in them
Tears of joy engulf them
When the determination in a young mind
Seem so convincing that 
They will bring change in the war torn country
They can make it against all odd

A phone call from miles away makes us proud
And we all run to document not only the immediate
But also the long term impact
Don't we love to see a young mind become better than us? 
What else would we give to guests who have been family for over decades? 
The best gift to any child is an education
It  takes them to higher horizons
It changes their mindset
No wealth is better than the wealth of the mind


They did not expect this. Being neither wise nor brave 
And wearing only the beauty of youth's season 
They took the first turning quite unquestioningly 
And walked quickly without looking back even once. 

It was of course the wrong turning. First they were nagged 
By a small wind that tugged at their clothing like a dog; 
Then the rain began and there was no shelter anywhere, 
Only the street and the rows of houses stern as soldiers. 

Though the blood chilled, the endearing word burnt the tongue. 
There were no parks or gardens or public houses: 
Midnight settled and the rain paused leaving the city 
Enormous and still like a great sleeping seal. 

At last they found accommodation in a cold 
Furnished room where they quickly learnt to believe in ghosts; 
They had their hope stuffed and put on the mantelpiece 
But found, after a while, that they did not notice it. 

While she spends many hours looking in the bottoms of teacups 
He reads much about association football 
And waits for the marvellous envelope to fall: 
Their eyes are strangers and they rarely speak. 
They did not expect this.




I know they drugged me
I woke up and I was old
I don't know who did it

I snuck into the drive in
back in nineteen sixty five
beneath a navy blanket

I went to sleep under there
when I opened my eyes
the first divorce was final

time did not slip away
it died in a train wreck
on the way to Illinois

the palm trees in heaven
look just like Florida
but I never found an angel

I know they drugged me
life flashed before my eyes
so I must have been alive


They flee from me that sometime did me seek
With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.
I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,
That now are wild and do not remember
That sometime they put themself in danger
To take bread at my hand; and now they range,
Busily seeking with a continual change.

Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise
Twenty times better; but once in special,
In thin array after a pleasant guise,
When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,
And she me caught in her arms long and small;
Therewithall sweetly did me kiss
And softly said, 'dear heart, how like you this?'

It was no dream: I lay broad waking.
But all is turned thorough my gentleness
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;
And I have leave to go of her goodness,
And she also, to use newfangleness.
But since that I so kindly am served
I would fain know what she hath deserved. 

Fifty years since their lives they gave
 So freedom lives the flag still waves
 They wanted to live, The same as you
 Be with their children, they never knew
 So many things, they all did miss
 Those soft sweet lips no more they'd kiss
 They loved to run feel the morning sun
 Loved so many things for they were young
 But war forced them to leave their home
 Fight in foreign lands and die alone
 So don't forget, though they are gone
 Though your life be sweet and full of song
 They gave their all, the flag still waves
 O'er the land of the free and the home fo the brave
 So when you see a lonesome grave
 And the stars and stripes above it waves
 Just bow your head and remember yet
 
 They gave so much; Please don't forget 

one stops digging for roots
so much soil will be shoveled
you gonna sweat it out
dirty yourself sometimes
only to find out that when you
trace a branching root and
know some names, birth and
death dates, and even some
details, and then you tell a
tip that you come from the
line of Juan who was born in  
they may nod without argument
but then they'll find no use of
you and so they continue going
deeper
and for years they had been
doing the same things over and
over again
without you.
they have their own darkness
to keep
and there is no use for whatever
light you are bringing. 

Because of your belief, you'll be persecuted or even abandoned.
You'll attempt to seek refuge and advice but only to be condemned.
In your difficult times, there will be backbiters and pretenders.
Then you'll know who your true friends really are.
You'll even know if those you have for so long referred to as your close relative or family will seem to be your worst enemy.
You'll struggle, kneeling on your feet you'll cuddle like a little sheep.
For they will only pretend to care.

In the struggle, they'll ask, how are and you and how do you do? 
But in the back of their mind they're really saying screw you.
Your kindness and gratitude will be returned with harshness and hate.
You'll help those that are dear to you but they'll only devise way to spite and oppress you.
In your difficult situation, you'll be tested, toiled and grieved.
Your mind will be confuse and unaware of the path to choose.
You'll try to escape the afflictions, only to realize that you have been surrounded.
Your life will be miserable.

Love those that hate you and pray for that persecute you.
I dare you to remember it when it's your time around in battle.
For it will ease your burdens tremendously.
In the process of suffering pray on bending knees with your hands and head lifting upwards.
Speak to him and let him know just how you feel.
For his grace is more than sufficient for what may ever come your way.
Let his light continue to shine in your life, and finally you see miraculous encounters. 

A game of He said, 
A game of She said, 
A game of He said She said, 
Gone terribly wrong.

She said, He said
'So what shall we do.'

He Said, She said
'Why lets go to the pool.'

She said, He said
'No lets go for a run.'

He said, She said
'Around here? '

She said, He said
'Anywhere I can make you cum.'

He said, She said
'Then I will not go.'

She said, He said
'Oh come on, we can take it slow.'

She said, 
'NO.'

He grabbed her wrist and said, 
'Let's fucking go! '

She screamed a plea.

He said, 
'Be quiet, I thought you liked me.'

'Of Course I did, but not anymore, 
And sorry to say I wont be your little whore.'

She Ran.

He went to the pool
And Swam. 

The Seasons seem in disarray, 
They vary much from day to day.
One time it’s cold, another hot, 
Misty morn or a sunny spot.
It seems they know not what to do, 
With one sky grey then one sky blue.

The plants they know not what is what, 
They rise up from the ground a lot.
But not at the right time it seems, 
When there is never bright sunbeams.
For Mr Frost will buds wipe out, 
But he’s kind to the brussels sprout.

Soon our planet will look so bare, 
We’re all to blame we have no care.
It is so sad to see this woe, 
Growing shoots when they shouldn’t grow.
The Seasons are all mixed about, 
Crazy’s the word there is no doubt.

The World is in a wobbly spin, 
The ozone layer is getting thin.
The moon’s moving away so fast, 
Cannot stop it, the dye is cast.
The damage can’t be rectified, 
We are on a slippery slide.

Appreciate the Earth right now, 
Before we take our final bow.
Let’s not damage it anymore, 
Take care of it I do implore.
For generations still to be, 
We must be wise, you must agree. 

They swarm like bees to the garden of wonder
Determined to find what their hearts have deplored.
Jamming their minds with earthshakin' thunder
Dancin' for rain they scorned long ago-

Not a single soul living outside of their hatred
For the blindness within they're hell bent to show
Fearin' the future for which they're already fated
Smelling of the stench of the seeds they have sowed.

Dead set on condemnin', the life they are given-
Righteous and rotten, down to the core.
In a gospel of hate, we already know.

Yelling steers and queers, and drunk Cheerleaders 
And blacks with their pants that are hangin' too low
Knockin' the world, from fearing their fears-
Doin' the same thing they did to the wild buffalo. 

But I do not want to go.
I do not want to pack up and leave.
This is something beyond all you'll ever know, 
So in my motives please believe.

I do not want to leave behind
The life I've lived and loved so far, 
Nor the times when peace I couldn't find, 
Because all these are what made me raise the bar.

I do not want to hear your conviction 
Because I just got accustomed to my life here, 
And despite all its restrictions, 
This is the life I no longer fear.

I do not want to ignore
The memories that bond me to this place, 
For I can't see the things I adore
And disregard the against-time race.

I do not want to leave my home, 
Because I feel it is the only thing left
That connects me to my own
Who has long since left.

I do not want to let this place go
Because to me its loss would be unbearable.
I know that out of this I should grow, 
But my feelings are an unforsaken parable 

I am not ready to close the book just yet
Because I'm only halfway through the chapter.
I'm scared all the events in it I might forget, 
And the characters I might no longer remember.

I do not want to be running away, 
But I do not want to face it all, 
For I can clearly see the downfall 
That lies end this pathway.  

Reading the works of those who died 
and risen from their commonality  makes me
feel that i am
after all, an inferior if not a mediocre
clown juggling with my own kind of lousy choice of words
and priority of ideas, 

i pause, i sigh, and has come to the brink of simply
perusing the tenets of chosen silence, 

but i keep the faith, i am different, and i belong to my own age now
upon a style that they have not taken
upon a choice that is lighted by the torch of my own idiosyncrasies

i read some more, down to the last details, they too, were dubbed
as morons during their harsh times.

with this, i write another one, and since then 
cannot stop. 

Today my mother and sisters
came to see me.

I had been alone a long time

My sister---the oldest---is grown up,
is blondish. An elemental dream
goes through her eyes: I told the youngest
"Life is sweet. Everything bad comes to an end


My mother smiled as those who understand souls
tend to do;
She placed two hands on my shoulders.
She's staring at me . . .
and tears spring from my eyes.

We ate together in the warmest room
of the house.
Spring sky . . . to see it
all the windows were opened.

And while we talked together quietly
of so much that is old and forgotten,
My sister---the youngest---interrupts:
"The swallows are flying by us

"THEY WANT TO FILM MY PAINS

Now they want to make a film
about me and the pains of yesterdays, 
But if only they could feel
what it is I feel
they would all be so I'll, 
My emptiness has left a Life time marks
all over my heart
Oh, the cuts are very deep
I feel most of the time I couldn't breathe
but now they want to film me
make stories about my pains
my life of a beaten down past
can they see my fears
my tears of blood rolling down my face? 
My heart bleeds the pains of Yesterdays
that keeps eating away at my soul
I had to take a deep breath
and I gave them my best of what it is I hold
deep down in my mind
that keeps me locked in that time
when they ask me
if they could film me and all my pains
I just moved my head
then I said yes
That is when I see the eyes of all times
Dark Angel looking deeper into mine
I crawled into my cold empty bed
praying one day this will all end
I pulled the cold sheets over my heard
like I was already dead.





Like sky and weather
they went everywhere together

he was rain & she was cloud
he was sun & she was light
she was moon & he was night

like sky & weather
they went everywhere together


he was frost & she was ice
he was fog & she was mist

she was sunrise.  

he was sunset

he was the sun on a certain morning
she was the sun awakening that morning

like sky & weather
they went everywhere together


They went home and told their wives, 
that never once in all their lives, 
had they known a girl like me, 
But.  They went home.

They said my house was licking clean, 
no word I spoke was ever mean, 
I had an air of mystery, 
But.  They went home.

My praises were on all men's lips, 
they liked my smile, my wit, my hips, 
they'd spend one night, or two or three.
But.  

They  went to school for study
Dreams they dreamt
Wanted  to be a big man like father
Wanted  to be a big lady  like mother
Leaving  mother's  lap they went to school to study
One-day terrorists     came  
And   killed  all the students.
But one of the student lay pretending like a dead
And at last he can alive.

He questioned to the world 
Why he has to live in this world
Pretending like a deadman?  WHY

Grief may have thought it was grief.
Care may have thought it was care.
They were welcome to their belief,
The overimportant pair.

No, it took all the snows that clung
To the low roof over his bed,
Beginning when he was young,
To induce the one snow on his head.

But whenever the roof camme white
The head in the dark below
Was a shade less the color of night,
A shade more the color of snow.

Grief may have thought it was grief.
Care may have thought it was care.
But neither one was the thief
Of his raven color of hair. 

they just stand there and see, 
wait and see, you work day and night, and pity you
while you sweat it out
and bleed with the blood from your brains, 
they always know how to wait and see, 
where the money is made
and then stored and then they always have a way
for you who earned it
to give, 

smilingly..

that is the rule of this society.. 

They who prepare my evening meal below 
Carelessly hit the kettle as they go 
With tongs or shovel, 
And ringing round and round, 
Out of this hovel 
It makes an eastern temple by the sound. 

At first I thought a cow bell right at hand 
Mid birches sounded o'er the open land, 
Where I plucked flowers 
Many years ago, 
Spending midsummer hours 
With such secure delight they hardly seemed to flow. 

To Mrs. Weigall

Into the stricken house who steals on quiet feet
And sudden brings the sunshine it used to wear?
Whose is the tender whisper that turns the bitter sweet?
Whose kiss is on your forehead, whose breath in your hair?

Who sits down beside you in the firelight glow?
Who leans on your shoulder like the boy of old?
Whose is the arm about you that you used to know,
Drawing the sting from your wound, your heart from cold?

Like the rustle of dead leaves in the autumn gloam
Running like little feet on a wind-swept road,
They are coming home so sweetly all the roads of home,

The horse in the stable whinnies by the door,
The dog of a sudden is wild with delight.
Who is this he welcomes, long waited for?
Who smiles in the shadow, so dear, so bright?

There's a face in the doorway, a foot on the floor.
They sit down beside us in the shadows grey,
Lay their heads on our breasts as oft before. 

They who tread the path of labor follow where My feet have trod; 
Nevermore thou needest seek me; I am with thee everywhere; 
Raise the stone, and thou shalt find Me, clease the wood and I am there. 

Where the many toil together, there am I among My own; 
Where the tired workman sleepeth, there am I with him alone: 
I, the Peace that passeth knowledge, dwell amid the daily strife; 
I, the Bread of Heav'n am broken in the sacrement of life. 

Every task, however simple, sets the soul that does it free; 
Every deed of love and mercy, done to man is done to Me. 
Nevermore thou needest seek me; I am with thee everywhere; 
Raise the stone, and thou shalt find Me; cleave the wood, and I am there. 

i have said my pieces
in my daily trances
there are angry men
who shall not forget me

but shall i worry then
if sometime i fall and
then they will tread upon
me with their furious feet

i shall not be destroyed

His moths are ready
to eat them all 
rags to his face
rotten clothes 
inside canalsit is enough that we are all here.
need we need more than our respective presences? 
the clouds appear above us, the simply pass and we see white skies.

Departures have their own way of leaving, 
in the same manner as arrivals.

why look for things which we cannot yet find? 
time ripens and become so sweet
for us to gather and savor

we are all  here and we just wait for the seasons
for those that come 
they are all for us
reserved and offered and soon shall be opened. 

your desires
are yours secrets
if they become
visible
they will see a
desert of
carcass where
vultures wait
for their double
kill

what is said
is superficial
these are the
norms and the
dictates of good
behavior of our
present time

when we arrive
in the house of our
best friend
we sit on his chair
inside the house
we are free
to sip coffee and
talk about anything
but mind you
we sift, and limit
our drift
' this is not our
house' you say
we cannot really
be ourselves
like cows on the
pasture
like a pig on
its sty.They won't frown always—some sweet Day
When I forget to tease—
They'll recollect how cold I looked
And how I just said "Please


Then They will hasten to the Door
To call the little Girl
Who cannot thank Them for the Ice
That filled the lisping full. 

Thick is the darkness -
Sunward, O, sunward!
Rough is the highway -
Onward, still onward!

Dawn harbours surely
East of the shadows.
Facing us somewhere
Spread the sweet meadows.

Upward and forward!
Time will restore us:
Light is above us,
Rest is before us. 

Thicker than rain-drops on November thorn. 

i switch on to 
desire
watching the thigh
and the bottom
of a human being

dance of love before 
me as i open my eyes
for clarity

curves and shapes
contours of a landscape
where i have been
for quite a time

there's cliff
and i plunge it

liberating 
i close my eyes
my hands shout
for joy

this is bliss
my abdomen says. 

Thin is in, thin is in
Bodies like paper, thin as fin
Thin as pencil, anemic skin
Portfolio of ribs, crying within

Thin is sin, Lady in size zero
Extra extra small, she is our hero
Skinny, emaciated, walks in a bolero
Anorexic fingers, she counts her dinero

Little dainty girls what do they know? 
Ain't their fault, they want to glow 
Models, they are just on the show
Wearing wedding gowns that flow.
 
Bowl of fruits to plum the lips
Longing for tasty fish and chips
Bowl of nothing to slim the hips
The show is killing them, tidy tips


Anemic profile, not thin by nature
Tired smiles, scrawny by nurture
Bag of bones are our fashion future
Room full of applause, shame on our culture


Designers and mothers looking for fame, 
Playing with little girl's psyche, so lame
Barbie dolls don't faint they  always claim
Dropping dead in designer clothes, what a shame! 


A lady with curves can't she hold the lamp? 
Can't a voluptuous woman be our champ? 
Don't they have smiles with a million amp? 
Oh why? Don't healthy curves fit the ramp? 


London fashion week refuses to ban ultra-thin models.

my eyes are asking: 
hey dude, are you not wasting your sight? 

you should have watched
bay bodies
rather than look for words, 

hey eyes, i own you
and if i want, i can waste all of you
on words.

where am i? the eyes are angry
but there shall be no tears.

i am the owner of my eyes
and i have always wasted them on
words.

till they close forever
but always without tears. 

This ocean, humiliating in its disguises
Tougher than anything.
No one listens to poetry. The ocean
Does not mean to be listened to. A drop
Or crash of water. It means
Nothing.
It
Is bread and butter
Pepper and salt. The death
That young men hope for. Aimlessly
It pounds the shore. White and aimless signals. No
One listens to poetry. 

What happened is, we grew lonely
living among the things,
so we gave the clock a face,
the chair a back,
the table four stout legs
which will never suffer fatigue.

We fitted our shoes with tongues
as smooth as our own
and hung tongues inside bells
so we could listen
to their emotional language,

and because we loved graceful profiles
the pitcher received a lip,
the bottle a long, slender neck.

Even what was beyond us
was recast in our image;
we gave the country a heart,
the storm an eye,
the cave a mouth
so we could pass into safety.(In Memoriam, Joseph Chamberlain)             

"And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more

" -- Genesis xxxvii. 

Oh ye who hold the written clue
  To all save all unwritten things,
And, half a league behind, pursue
  The accomplished Fact with flouts and flings,
  Look! To your knee your baby brings
    The oldest tale since Earth began --
  The answer to your worryings:
    "Once on a time there was a Man


He, single-handed, met and slew
  Magicians, Armies, Ogres, Kings.
He lonely 'mid his doubting crew --
  "In all the loneliness of wings " --
  He fed the flame, he filled the springs,
    He locked the ranks, he launched the van
  Straight at the grinning Teeth of Things.
    "Once on a time there was a Man


The peace of shocked Foundations flew
  Before his ribald questionings.
He broke the Oracles in two,
  And bared the paltry wires and strings.
  He headed desert wanderings;
    He led his soul, his cause, his clan
  A little from the ruck of Things.
    "Once on a time there was a Man


Thrones, Powers, Dominions block the view
   With episodes and underlings --
The meek historian deems them true
  Nor heeds the song that Clio sings --
  The simple central truth that stings
    The mob to boo, the priest to ban;
   Things never yet created things --
     "Once on a time there was a Man


A bolt is fallen from the blue.
  A wakened realm full circle swings
Where Dothan's dreamer dreams anew
  Of vast and farborne harvestings;
  And unto him an Empire clings
    That grips the purpose of his plan.
    Once -- in our time -- is there a Man

there are so many things I did not say
I may have hinted once or twice
but that is not enough

the seasons pass and time must take its toll
the sun is fading in the west
a breeze confounds the air

there are those things yet better left unsaid
that may bring pain or wistfulness
but there is still regret

now it is late and I must go my way
you must have seen my doubt filled eyes
I could not find the wordsit's March h
I'm sitting by the window on the Prague-Berlin train 
night is falling
I never knew I liked
night descending like a tired bird on a smoky wet plain 
I don't like
comparing nightfall to a tired bird

I didn't know I loved the earth
can someone who hasn't worked the earth love it 
I've never worked the earth
it must be my only Platonic love

and here I've loved rivers all this time
whether motionless like this they curl skirting the hills
European hills crowned with chateaus
or whether stretched out flat as far as the eye can see
I know you can't wash in the same river even once
I know the river will bring new lights you'll never see
I know we live slightly longer than a horse but not nearly as long as a crow
I know this has troubled people before
                         and will trouble those after me
I know all this has been said a thousand times before 
                         and will be said after me

I didn't know I loved the sky 
cloudy or clear
the blue vault Andrei studied on his back at Borodino
in prison I translated both volumes of War and Peace into Turkish 
I hear voices
not from the blue vault but from the yard 
the guards are beating someone again
I didn't know I loved trees
bare beeches near Moscow in Peredelkino
they come upon me in winter noble and modest 
beeches are Russian the way poplars are Turkish 
"the poplars of Izmir
losing their leaves. . .
they call me The Knife. . .
                         lover like a young tree. . .
I blow stately mansions sky-high"
in the Ilgaz woods in I tied an embroidered linen handkerchief 
                                        to a pine bough for luck

I never knew I loved roads 
even the asphalt kind
Vera's behind the wheel we're driving from Moscow to the Crimea 
                                                          Koktebele
                               formerly "Goktepe ili" in Turkish 
the two of us inside a closed box
the world flows past on both sides distant and mute 
I was never so close to anyone in my life
bandits stopped me on the red road between Bolu and Gerede
                                        when I was eighteen
apart from my life I didn't have anything in the wagon they could take 
and at eighteen our lives are what we value least
I've written this somewhere before
wading through a dark muddy street I'm going to the shadow play 
Ramazan night
a paper lantern leading the way
maybe nothing like this ever happened
maybe I read it somewhere an eight-year-old boy
                                       going to the shadow play
Ramazan night in Istanbul holding his grandfather's hand 
   his grandfather has on a fez and is wearing the fur coat
      with a sable collar over his robe
   and there's a lantern in the servant's hand
   and I can't contain myself for joy
flowers come to mind for some reason 
poppies cactuses jonquils
in the jonquil garden in Kadikoy Istanbul I kissed Marika 
fresh almonds on her breath
I was seventeen
my heart on a swing touched the sky 
I didn't know I loved flowers
friends sent me three red carnations in prison

I just remembered the stars 
I love them too
whether I'm floored watching them from below 
or whether I'm flying at their side

I have some questions for the cosmonauts 
were the stars much bigger
did they look like huge jewels on black velvet
                             or apricots on orange
did you feel proud to get closer to the stars
I saw color photos of the cosmos in Ogonek magazine now don't 
   be upset comrades but nonfigurative shall we say or abstract 
   well some of them looked just like such paintings which is to 
   say they were terribly figurative and concrete
my heart was in my mouth looking at them 
they are our endless desire to grasp things
seeing them I could even think of death and not feel at all sad 
I never knew I loved the cosmos

snow flashes in front of my eyes
both heavy wet steady snow and the dry whirling kind 
I didn't know I liked snow

I never knew I loved the sun
even when setting cherry-red as now
in Istanbul too it sometimes sets in postcard colors 
but you aren't about to paint it that way
I didn't know I loved the sea
                             except the Sea of Azov
or how much

I didn't know I loved clouds
whether I'm under or up above them
whether they look like giants or shaggy white beasts

moonlight the falsest the most languid the most petit-bourgeois 
strikes me
I like it

I didn't know I liked rain
whether it falls like a fine net or splatters against the glass my 
   heart leaves me tangled up in a net or trapped inside a drop 
   and takes off for uncharted countries I didn't know I loved 
   rain but why did I suddenly discover all these passions sitting 
   by the window on the Prague-Berlin train
is it because I lit my sixth cigarette 
one alone could kill me
is it because I'm half dead from thinking about someone back in Moscow
her hair straw-blond eyelashes blue

the train plunges on through the pitch-black night
I never knew I liked the night pitch-black
sparks fly from the engine
I didn't know I loved sparks
I didn't know I loved so many things and I had to wait until sixty 
   to find it out sitting by the window on the Prague-Berlin train 
   watching the world disappear as if on a journey of no return

                                                     April Moscow
 
 
my favorite colors
tan and blue
political incorrectness
inappropriate clothing
an open collar
and an open schedule
I like dogs, hounds especially
small rivers and small boats
I like cooking in a skillet
Dutch oven stew for company
I like not worrying
about cholesterol
the economy, the wars
or anything else
I like hot weather
orchids, all flowers
pretty women, birds
the beach with no one there
red wine is good
sunsets
wind in the pine trees
memories
silence
a moment to think
a moment to not think


Things of crumbs
- - - - - - - - - - - 
Things of crumbs asked
And even that little is not granted
Hence in silence heart is broken
With a sorrow not known
Pushing you down to the bottom
And you walk your way alone
The worst of all emotions
Confines you as if in a prison
With a tearful cadence
You groan with cramps
And your face turns furious
It comes when you miss 
The goal almost in sight of goal
Despite best efforts
On love, toil and talent it takes a toll
Then comes its cousin
Causing a lot of damage to your potential
It is felt when things are stuck
Things take time to move
And when they move, you will be in hell
And think that you have not picked up the right goal
It takes away your prime energy
And turns you a person distasteful
This is none other than
Disappointment followed by frustration
And this can be overcome
If you hold fast to hope
No matter looks how small


Your bodies up for rent, 
It’s been a tough day, 
All your dollars have been spent, 
You best be on your way.

What happened to you? 
What happened to you? 

I’ll never forget your face, 
That lonely place, 
Those charcoal eyes, 
And the stifled cries.
Things will get better, 
Things will get better.

Walking down the empty road, 
Smiling in your little leather boats, 
Bottle of whiskey for a friend, 
Your hands swinging loose.

What happened to you? 
What happened to you? 

I’ll never forget your face, 
That lonely place, 
Those charcoal eyes, 
And the stifled cries.
Things will get better, 
Things will get better.

You travelled far to long, 
Burnt all your roots, 
Tried to sing a song, 
Ended up all wrong.

What happened to you? 
What happened to you? 

I’ll never forget your face, 
That lonely place, 
Those charcoal eyes, 
And the stifled cries.
Things will get better, 
Things will get better.


Think, is the person you're telling going to be able to heal

Is what you're saying necessary for everyone else to know
Just because you're thinking something, maybe you should just let it go

Everyone else around you may not be as strong
Some things need to be kept hidden and you should move along

You don't know where that person has come from or where he's going to go
What kind of day he's had, you just don't know

Before you blurt out everything you feel
Think, is the person listening going to be able to heal

Speak a word in my ear
Rhyme a word everywhere
Sweet and soothing 
Moving and mesmerizing
It is and it is my dear
For words you murmur
Reaching always afar
In Earth and in Heaven
Immersed in yours
To hear what you say
What you pray
What you abjure
What you conjure
Nor is He blind, nor mute
Nor does He falter
As you think Him to be
And you are under the veil
Of your ignorance my dear 
All you have to do is to sit still
And see how elders pray, 
Gospel music how they sing and play
They read all through day
When you are in distress and disarray-


Ages back this planet was barren
One morning dispersed life like sunshine
Species have evolved, flourished, perished
And a peculiar animal has appeared.
Started living and thinking together
"Creation? ! ? "
Wondered at first
About  ‘itself’
And life around
"No it’s evolution? ! ? "
many later has thundered
Has grown and shown
Certain values unknown
Devised numbers, created letters
Became "man of letters "
Evolved into a poet, a singer
An architect and a philosopher

But now
Computer substitutes ‘its’ thinking
Neutron bomb threatens  ‘its ‘ living
Here explodes a bomb; there arises a fanatic
Here changes a ruler; there breaks out a war
Whatever might be the event
Senseless genocide of innocent people is imminent
Many feel ‘man ‘ has become a machine
No longer cherishes, relishes or nourishes
Values that are humane
And ‘behaves’ as ‘ it’ wishes

But I feel
Unless we are humane again
Our existence is at stake
Though we are able to
Fly like birds
Swim like fish
Set our feet on moon
Roam in the space
Or have babies avoiding sex


Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly: 
Why should men make haste to die? 
Empty heads and tongues a-talking 
Make the rough road easy walking, 
And the feather pate of folly 
Bears the falling sky. 

Oh, 'tis jesting, dancing, drinking 
Spins the heavy world around. 
If young hearts were not so clever, 
Oh, they would be young for ever: 
Think no more; 'tis only thinking 
Lays lads underground. 

THINK not of it, sweet one, so;---
      Give it not a tear;
Sigh thou mayst, and bid it go
      Any---anywhere.

Do not lool so sad, sweet one,---
      Sad and fadingly;
Shed one drop then,---it is gone---
      O 'twas born to die!

Still so pale? then, dearest, weep;
      Weep, I'll count the tears,
And each one shall be a bliss
      For thee in after years.

Brighter has it left thine eyes
      Than a sunny rill;
And thy whispering melodies
      Are tenderer still.

Yet---as all things mourn awhile
      At fleeting blisses,
E'en let us too! but be our dirge
      A dirge of kisses. 

Think positive
Is what always echo in my ears, 
Do no think otherwise
This will wipe away your fears.

The moment anything negative 
Comes to your mind, 
Immediately strike it out 
By thinking about something positive.

While praying do not bring 
Any negative words in your mind, 
Keep chanting only positive 
Peace and solace then you will find.

Say, we are stuck in the midst of a bad traffic, 
See a negativity running in our mind 

Our whole day goes bad
We keep blaming the fate like mad, 
Might have worked out fairly! 

As one says, its always easier said than done! 
As its not really easy to eliminate negative thoughts from our mind, 
But surely its possible to strike out the negative, 
And thereby make our disturbing thoughts unwind. 

Drifting in the lonely redwoods, I met a monstrous leviathan 
By switching his homes and names - hermit and egotist heinous 
Loner, sequester and seclusionist are his names - atrocious! 
Think-tank! Sink-sank! A lonely pink rose shrinks in only garden! 

I'm taking blows of west wind in barren land, cries a lone hand; 
I'm sitting with empty ache; I'm a fruitcake in the lonely land! 
I'm a blue star in the night sky; lonely car in the lonely street.
In darkness, I'm in rivers of blood and fears; is it solo treat? 
Think-tank! Sink-sank! A lonely pink rose shrinks in only garden! 

Lonely I am, I sit and stare; stand and care, yet a lonely stick! 
Lonely I am, I feel pain; I cry my eyes out with lonely lipstick! 
Lonely I am, like it or hate it, I feel and deal in lonely date; 
I don't want to be lonely, I'm with me yet I'm alone, is it fate? 
Think-tank! Sink-sank! A lonely pink rose shrinks in only garden! 

Today I'm in sorrow, I don't know tomorrow, sings a lone sparrow; 
Lonely in the morning I wake in the life of fake for lonely sake; 
Loneness burdens, a gutless fight, a pitiless fall, a story fake! 
I don't want to die, but I can't bear it anymore says a lone arrow
Think-tank! Sink-sank! A lonely pink rose shrinks in only garden! 

Among horny cassowaries bumbles a solo red robin - lissome
Betwixt morbid jackals tumbles a solo cervid, a deer lovesome 
Along the Blue Super Giants funks a solo red dwarf star handsome  
In the smutty cabbage skunks shrinks solo cherry blossom awesome, 
Think-tank! Sink-sank! A lonely pink rose shrinks in only garden

I swerved to avoid hitting a squirrel
in the center of the road and that's when
the deer came charging out of the forest
and forced me to hit the brakes for all I
was worth and I careened back to the other
side of the road just as a skunk came toddling
out of Mrs. Bancroft's front yard and I swung
back perhaps just grazing it a bit. I glanced
quickly in the rearview mirror and in that
instant a groundhog waddled from the side
of the road and I zigzagged madly and don't
know if I nipped it or not because up ahead I
could see a coyote stalking the Collier's
cat. Oh well, I said, and drove the rest
of the way home without incident. 

In the late night listening from bed
I have joined the ambulance or the patrol
screaming toward some drama, the kind of end
that Berky must have some day, if she isn't dead.

The wildest of all, her father and mother cruel,
farming out there beyond the old stone quarry
where highschool lovers parked their lurching cars,
Berky learned to love in that dark school.

Early her face was turned away from home
toward any hardworking place; but still her soul,
with terrible things to do, was alive, looking out
for the rescue that--surely, some day--would have to come.

Windiest nights, Berky, I have thought for you,
and no matter how lucky I've been I've touched wood.
There are things not solved in our town though tomorrow came:
there are things time passing can never make come true.

We live in an occupied country, misunderstood;
justice will take us millions of intricate moves.
Sirens wil hunt down Berky, you survivors in your beds
listening through the night, so far and good. 

i gaze upon the starry night
i think about our previous fight.
though i knew it wasn't right.
i still see that vivid sight.

no one can explain what went down.
but they see my constant frown.
they wounder if im still around.
if i ever put my razor down.

a continuous bleed.
on my knees i plead.
to take away my need.
to take away my evil deed.

thinking. 
hoping. 
pleading . 

take me away from here.
i don't want him near.
he created the fear.
thats why you see me tear.

he took my innocence.
it makes no sense.
he put up a fence.
to blockade my nonsense.

why should i be shared? 
he doesn't care.
it isn't fair! 
now you've ripped my tear. 

we try to understand our
being on earth

others have created what
we should know

followers follow, others
think

independent thought is rare
as we must conform 

living in communities getting
along

but conformity does not stop
a thinking mind

mind be a thinking vehicle
transporting thought


In this evil year, autumn comes early. 
I walk by night in the field, alone, the rain clatters,
The wind on my hat.  

And you? And you, my friend? 

You are standing- maybe- and seeing the sickle moon
Move in a small arc over the forests
And bivouac fire, red in the black valley.
You are lying- maybe- in a straw field and sleeping
And dew falls cold on your forehead and battle jacket.

It's possible tonight you're on horseback,
The farthest outpost, peering along, with a gun in your fist,
Smiling, whispering, to your exhausted horse.
Maybe- I keep imagining- you are spending the night
As a guest in a strange castle with a park
And writing a letter by candlelight, and tapping
On the piano keys by the window,
Groping for a sound. 

- And maybe
You are already silent, already dead, and the day
Will shine no longer into your beloved
Serious eyes, and your beloved brown hand hangs wilted,
And your white forehead split open- Oh, if only,
If only, just once, that last day, I had shown you, told you
Something of my love, that was too timid to speak! 

But you know me, you know.  

and, smiling, you nod
Tonight in front of your strange castle,
And you nod to your horse in the drenched forest,
And you nod to your sleep to your harsh clutter of straw,
And think about me, and smile.
And maybe,
Maybe some day you will come back from the war,
and take a walk with me some evening,
And somebody will talk about Longwy, Luttich, Dammerkirch,
And smile gravely, and everything will be as before,
And no one will speak a word of his worry,
Of his worry and tenderness by night in the field,
Of his love. And with a single joke
You will frighten away the worry, the war, the uneasy nights,
The summer lightning of shy human friendship,
Into the cool past that will never come back.






The first hot April day the granite step
was warm. Flies droned in the grass.
When a car went past they rose
in unison, then dropped back down. . . .

I saw that a yellow crocus bud had pierced
a dead oak leaf, then opened wide. How strong
its appetite for the luxury of the sun!

Everyone longs for love's tense joy and red delights.

And then I spied an ant
dragging a ragged, disembodied wing
up the warm brick walk. It must have been
the Methodist in me that leaned forward,
preceded by my shadow, to put a twig just where
the ant was struggling with its own desire. 

Thinking of you is pretty, hopeful, 
It is like listening to the most beautiful song 
From the most beautiful voice on earth.  
But hope is not enough for me any more, 
I don't want to listen to songs any more, 
I want to sing. 

Not so young and vibrant anymore
Wonder what the future holds in store
What contract did I sign on coming in? 
When does the living end and death begin? 

I watch as others teeter on the brink
What designates the change in how we think? 
An inkling from subconscious level mind
That tells us we're beginning to unwind? 

It seems that once the process has begun
The body knows there is no place to run
And so the battle wages, short or long
And in the end the living sing our song: 

They praise us for the good deeds we have done
And raise us up as rainbows in the sun, 
Funny how you never hear a word
About the juicy stories they all heard: 

They say nobody's perfect, that's for sure
So who are they to say you were not pure? 
The slate is clean again and all is well.  
Will heaven take you in or give you hell? 

er laughter was a starburst, 
a h of July explosion
in his heart.

When he walked with rivers, 
as a child walks, there was no time
for a harvest of tears.

To claim to know the universe
is an arrogant attempt
at divinity.

men lay death at his feet.

He sang to her a love song
that was like
a bird is a silent forest.

The late rising moon
lights the darkest night, 
surpassing the stars.

but, in his love
and his passing, sets us free.

The cherished virgin
vile mankind
has made a target.

When he feels the wind blow, 
he knows the planet turns.

The sun fires
priceless diamonds
on a frosty morning.

If she loves his song, 
he knows the raintree blooms, 
the seed of another year.

His neighbor's roof blew away.
Of its destruction, 
he will build his home.

The orchid waits for men
to depart
for it does not fear the snake.

What price must he pay
for his personal tyranny, 
for forgiveness? 

Power becomes a club
but it should be a question.

Ah yes Rabi, the hill is but
a failed attempt at heaven.
We climb to never reach.

If one song of his
wafted to a single ear, 
that was all he sought.

The fear that he is nothing
is a prison where he, 
safe from scorn, 
hides from your eyes.

The sky holds its breath
and waits for an embrace.

The green parrots came
taking the sunflower's bounty
and never asked nor thanked.

A melody he hears in the wind
tells him the work
is not yet done.
There is a solemn hymn
drifting in its rushing.

Where the dove waits, 
beside a silver gate, 
the jeweled peace beyond
is a psalm. 

To take more than the need
is to devour one's own soul
as the earth grieves.

A vanished love leaves
an airless vacuum, 
years without breath, 
then the lungs fill.

He swore to remember her kiss
and still he does. But some forget
there was a pledge.

If he could be content
with his philosophy
as the sun sets, 
he would embrace the night.

We can grow wisdom
out of pain; a world
of professors nod and bow.

He curses the clouds
that he creates because
they block the sun.

The paradox is silence
for we all hunger
for the words.

If he was the servant
of a god he did not know, 
then what a great surprise
in paradise.

He waits for her
to share with him
the evening meal
and all eternity.

The stream of thought, 
that comes from
the eternal man, 
awaits a weeping sky, 
reunited in stardust.

Deep in the pond of memory
lie all his loves and all his love
beyond all words. 

My spirit wails for water, water now! 
My tongue is aching dry, my throat is hot 
For water, fresh rain shaken from a bough, 
Or dawn dews heavy in some leafy spot. 
My hungry body's burning for a swim 
In sunlit water where the air is cool, 
As in Trout Valley where upon a limb 
The golden finch sings sweetly to the pool. 
Oh water, water, when the night is done, 
When day steals gray-white through the windowpane, 
Clear silver water when I wake, alone, 
All impotent of parts, of fevered brain; 
Pure water from a forest fountain first, 
To wash me, cleanse me, and to quench my thirst

Your hair
flows over

your left shoulder

splashes itself
across your right breast.

Thirsty, I
.  

drink it all in. 

As the light glows dim 
The globe spins off its natural orbit and the minds of men whim

As the darkness deepens
Reason is subdued by residing sins calling from within 
The soul of man is shackled by sinful thinking
Lo the heart of man drowning in evil like a flooded ship sinking in the restless seas of sinful temptations
Will primitive clay today rise above the recurrent tides? 
Will the son of man survive the times? 
Will he be rescued n receive healing in his dying mind? 

Shall he overcome? 
shall he breakthrough the dark clouds like the rising sun? 
will he taste freedom beyond these mental bars? 
Someday shall man ascend above the ruins of his fallen estate? 
Part ways with his aphoric nature n glitter like stars? 

Is there a light at the end of this foggy tunnel called existence? 
in one sentence what is the way out this circuitous maze? 

We've come a long way
Endured painful n perilous days collectively as a race
regardless efforts desperate we slack in our pace
Undoubtedly our journey has been long 
but we barely have made it out this primeval page called today

Does freedom fly where mortals dwell? 
Or perhaps freedom is shackled within the lightless dungeons of hell
All thirst for freedom but the path that winds to freedoms' sanctum, 
whom amongst masses can tell? 
Man will find freedom perhaps in this democratic cell. 

I 

Among twenty snowy mountains, 
The only moving thing 
Was the eye of the black bird. 

II 

I was of three minds, 
Like a tree 
In which there are three blackbirds. 

III 

The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. 
It was a small part of the pantomime. 

IV 

A man and a woman 
Are one. 
A man and a woman and a blackbird 
Are one. 

V 

I do not know which to prefer, 
The beauty of inflections 
Or the beauty of innuendoes, 
The blackbird whistling 
Or just after. 

VI 

Icicles filled the long window 
With barbaric glass. 
The shadow of the blackbird 
Crossed it, to and fro. 
The mood 
Traced in the shadow 
An indecipherable cause. 

VII 

O thin men of Haddam, 
Why do you imagine golden birds? 
Do you not see how the blackbird 
Walks around the feet 
Of the women about you? 

VIII 

I know noble accents 
And lucid, inescapable rhythms; 
But I know, too, 
That the blackbird is involved 
In what I know. 

IX 

When the blackbird flew out of sight, 
It marked the edge 
Of one of many circles. 

X 

At the sight of blackbirds 
Flying in a green light, 
Even the bawds of euphony 
Would cry out sharply. 

XI 

He rode over Connecticut 
In a glass coach. 
Once, a fear pierced him, 
In that he mistook 
The shadow of his equipage 
For blackbirds. 

XII 

The river is moving. 
The blackbird must be flying. 

XIII 

It was evening all afternoon. 
It was snowing 
And it was going to snow. 
The blackbird sat 
In the cedar-limbs. 

I couldn't touch a stop and turn a screw,
And set the blooming world a-work for me,
Like such as cut their teeth -- I hope, like you --
On the handle of a skeleton gold key;
I cut mine on a leek, which I eat it every week:
I'm a clerk at thirty bob as you can see.

But I don't allow it's luck and all a toss;
There's no such thing as being starred and crossed;
It's just the power of some to be a boss,
And the bally power of others to be bossed:
I face the music, sir; you bet I ain't a cur;
Strike me lucky if I don't believe I'm lost!

For like a mole I journey in the dark,
A-travelling along the underground
From my Pillar'd Halls and broad Suburbean Park,
To come the daily dull official round;
And home again at night with my pipe all alight,
A-scheming how to count ten bob a pound.

And it's often very cold and very wet,
And my missus stitches towels for a hunks;
And the Pillar'd Halls is half of it to let--
Three rooms about the size of travelling trunks.
And we cough, my wife and I, to dislocate a sigh,
When the noisy little kids are in their bunks.

But you never hear her do a growl or whine,
For she's made of flint and roses, very odd;
And I've got to cut my meaning rather fine,
Or I'd blubber, for I'm made of greens and sod:
So p'r'haps we are in Hell for all that I can tell,

I ain't blaspheming, Mr. Silver-tongue;
I'm saying things a bit beyond your art:
Of all the rummy starts you ever sprung,
Thirty bob a week's the rummiest start!
With your science and your books and your the'ries about spooks,
Did you ever hear of looking in your heart?

I didn't mean your pocket, Mr., no:
I mean that having children and a wife,
With thirty bob on which to come and go,
Isn't dancing to the tabor and the fife:
When it doesn't make you drink, by Heaven! it makes you think,
And notice curious items about life.

I step into my heart and there I meet
A god-almighty devil singing small,
Who would like to shout and whistle in the street,
And squelch the passers flat against the wall;
If the whole world was a cake he had the power to take,
He would take it, ask for more, and eat them all.

And I meet a sort of simpleton beside,
The kind that life is always giving beans;
With thirty bob a week to keep a bride
He fell in love and married in his teens:
At thirty bob he stuck; but he knows it isn't luck:
He knows the seas are deeper than tureens.

And the god-almighty devil and the fool
That meet me in the High Street on the strike,
When I walk about my heart a-gathering wool,
Are my good and evil angels if you like.
And both of them together in every kind of weather
Ride me like a double-seated bike.

That's rough a bit and needs its meaning curled.
But I have a high old hot un in my mind --
A most engrugious notion of the world,
That leaves your lightning 'rithmetic behind:
I give it at a glance when I say 'There ain't no chance,
Nor nothing of the lucky-lottery kind.'

And it's this way that I make it out to be:
No fathers, mothers, countres, climates -- none;
Not Adam was responsible for me,
Nor society, nor systems, nary one:
A little sleeping seed, I woke -- I did, indeed --
A million years before the blooming sun.

I woke because I thought the time had come;
Beyond my will there was no other cause;
And everywhere I found myself at home,
Because I chose to be the thing I was;
And in whatever shape of mollusc or of ape
I always went according to the laws.

I was the love that chose my mother out;
I joined two lives and from the union burst;
My weakness and my strength without a doubt
Are mine alone for ever from the first:
It's just the very same with a difference in the name
As 'Thy will be done.' You say it if you durst!

They say it daily up and down the land
As easy as you take a drink, it's true;
But the difficultest go to understand,
And the difficultest job a man can do,
Is to come it brave and meek with thirty bob a week,
And feel that that's the proper thing for you.

It's a naked child against a hungry wolf;
It's playing bowls upon a splitting wreck;
It's walking on a string across a gulf
With millstones fore-and-aft about your neck;
But the thing is daily done by many and many a one;
And we fall, face forward, fighting, on the deck. 

The universe has many years, 
but Mozart in just thirty-five
enables everyone who hears
his music that a man alive
for just a fraction of the time
extending from Bing Bang to now
may help us soar towards sublime, 

ou can see him standing tall a statue
amidst the sea in kanyakumari
right at the bottom of india
He was a poet who wrote short verses
just two lines was his verse
four words in the first.. 

three in the next.. 

and
that was his format
 
Some say he is younger
some say he is older
his poems remind you of christ
for instance. 
  'ennar seitharaei oruthar avarnana
   nannayam seidhu vidu'
  [ if a person does a bad to you.. 

ashame him by doing a good to him]
just like getting slapped on both cheeks.. 

to
awaken the doers conscience
 
  'anbillar aellam thamakuriyar aanbudiar
   aendrum ooriyar pirariku'
  [a person without love is to himself
   a person with love belongs to others]
 
  'theeyinal suttapun ullarum aradhai
   navinal sutta vadu'
  [ a wound inflicted by a flame would heal from within
   a wound inflicted by a word would'nt heal for good]
 
  'kullal inidhu yalinidhu aembhar tham
   mazhalai sol kelaathavar'
  [ only a person who has'nt listened to his siblings baby talk
   would praise the flute and veena for its sweetness]
 
THIRUVALLUVAR was a rare poet
one of his sort
at a very early part
he never made a mention
of any religion or nation
in any of his creation
he was not made a cult
should thank god for that
THIRUVALLUVAR WAS A UNIVERSAL POET

you sick
mother*****. 

This side of midnight casts 
a spell upon the day.
Day darkens as the children cry.
Cry a feeling of loneliness.
 But as the light shines
the doom has withered away.
Another day granted for
all to see.
See the light shining in their
eyes. 

I write this song for you 
When you're feeling just blue 
In this moment when life is dead 
And you know there's nothing ahead 

I will see you through morning 
In your time of such mourning 
I will shed my tears with you 
In this time that is damn true  

I will hear your cries of pain 
And comfort you through the disdain 
I will wrap you in the warmth of my touch 
Until threshold of pain is just such  

I will taste with you this great suffering 
And I will make you this one offering 
I will sit by the comfort of your side 
And take with you this adventurous ride

I rake the air, 
For the image now gone, 
A faded memory, 
An unknown treasure, 
An unspoken song.
I cling to the pieces of the deed, 
But never will a thought be enough, 
To conjure life in what had me freed, 
That is now my bane, 
My wound, my unwanted greed.
I ask for less, 
I got it all, 
The empty room, 
The frigid hands, 
I look down the well once filled, 
Brimming with tears of the shaky haze, 
Of roses red, of passion bright, 
When all around was filled with light, 
Far gone days, in a daze, 
I wagered.
Gone, tossed away, 
What I am regurgitated by its own gaze.
I sleep no more, my hunger gone, 
When I believed it better for me, 
All along.
The blindness blessed, 
The morning broke, 
Scenes of perdition I alienated and forsook, 
Now I clasp a lifeless sound, 
That resonates hollowly, 
With none around.
I gave it up, 
I lost the way.
The joy I had, 
Now cast away.
I am now one of them, part of the fray, 
None to guide, 
No purpose; dismay.
So I seek now a humble home, 
To let me in, 
To clothe my lone.
Never to take it all away, 
What was the sweetest the other day.
But I cast it out, 
I shattered the Beauty, 
Of that which contemplation cursed me.
So now I wander by the path, 
Which I forsook, in my own wrath.
The day is long, and I grow weary, 
I wonder if you will ever hear me.
Or if all is lost, all hope is gone, 
I am doomed to sing, 
This aimless song. 

I am an American, 
Through and through, 
No new cars for me, 
I want to support the economy. 

We spend many thousands 
To send to Japan, Korea or some other Foreign land. 

My money stays right here, 
Right at the garage, 
Where I park it all day, 
I simply can't understand, 
Why they don't make the parts 
Any longer. 

Before the War, 
We had it right, 
Every brought American, 
And that was all right. 
Now, I find that parts are being made in Japan. 

This problem is simple, 
It is easy to solve, 
Why doesn't everyone boycott, 
Buying new cars. 

This will drive down the price, 
And will entice the automakers 
To bring the process back to the place 
Where it ought to be, 
Back from Japan, Korea, and Singapore, 

Let's do it now, 
Before we loose any more classics, 
Gone are the Mercurys, Firebirds, and Capri's, 

Where are the Lincolns of the past, 
Pretty soon they at rest in rust, 
The rest of the car companies please heed, 
What ever happened to the Nash, the Kaiser and the Dart? 

Will we learn a lesson here, 
I doubt, 
But I have learned a valuable one, 

Stick with winner and don't ever sell it, 
Transportation is more than movement for me, 
It is part of our country!This Bauble was preferred of Bees—
By Butterflies admired
At Heavenly—Hopeless Distances—
Was justified of Bird—

Did Noon—enamel—in Herself
Was Summer to a Score
Who only knew of Universe—
It had created Her. 

This beautiful night ~

The moon above is softly glowing as the
clouds go flowing by.
The stars they all beam and in their gleam
 ''your beauty alone'' is what catches my eye

This beautiful night ~

The fireflies are glowing and the crickets
are crooning - Their love songs are everywhere
All that I hear are our whispers of love. There
is no other sound to compare

This beautiful night ~

As I hold you tight, your love is all I desire 
One kiss only from your sweet lips. Sparks     
a flame that turns into fire.

This beautiful night ~

T'would never seem right without you in my
arms as I hold you tight. The moon would
not glow and the stars above no longer  
would shine as they do. No longer would   
There be all this beauty I see - without you. 

*********************************** ***************
This wine upon a foreign tree
Plunged in its fruit;
Man in the day or wine at night
Laid the crops low, broke the grape's joy.

Once in this time wine the summer blood
Knocked in the flesh that decked the vine,
Once in this bread
The oat was merry in the wind;
Man broke the sun, pulled the wind down.

This flesh you break, this blood you let
Make desolation in the vein,
Were oat and grape
Born of the sensual root and sap;
My wine you drink, my bread you snap.This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life
I mention it to you,
When Sunrise through a fissure drop
The Day must follow too.

If we demur, its gaping sides
Disclose as 'twere a Tomb
Ourself am lying straight wherein
The Favorite of Doom.

When it has just contained a Life
Then, Darling, it will close
And yet so bolder every Day
So turbulent it grows

I'm tempted half to stitch it up
With a remaining Breath
I should not miss in yielding, though
To Him, it would be Death—

And so I bear it big about
My Burial—before
A Life quite ready to depart
Can harass me no more—This Consciousness that is aware
Of Neighbors and the Sun
Will be the one aware of Death
And that itself alone

Is traversing the interval
Experience between
And most profound experiment
Appointed unto Men—

How adequate unto itself
Its properties shall be
Itself unto itself and none
Shall make discovery.

Adventure most unto itself
The Soul condemned to be—
Attended by a single Hound
Its own identity. 

This counsel to the body give, O Soul: 
Wear only such clothes as ward off cold; 
Eat only to satisfy your hunger; 
Devote yourself with all your heart 
to the knowledge of the Supreme Self. 
Consider this body to be food for the forest ravens. 

This daughterless night  is deepening. 
The tinkle of laughter awaits
and unlistened-to interruptions 
for someone who is always thinking. 

This daughterless night  is darkening. 
The bowl of fruit
suffers no wristwatches
but the clock is always ticking. 

Below the samphire 
tides wash idly at the feet
of the pale, impassive cliff 
of this night without daughters. 

Even planets envy the clockwork 
of the daughters who lurch and ricochet 
in a world of messages 
and surprises. 

The notes of rain descend 
the slope of this daughterless night, 
a hammering of tin nails 
in the seasonal pattern-shift. 

People everywhere are awakening
to the morbidity of the world 
and the starkness of its rules. 
Dawn gnaws at the feet of daughters.This Dust, and its Feature—
Accredited—Today—
Will in a second Future—
Cease to identify—

This Mind, and its measure—
A too minute Area
For its enlarged inspection's
Comparison—appear—

This World, and its species
A too concluded show
For its absorbed Attention's
Remotest scrutiny—This heartache this sadness
this feeling of pain
to think I'll never hear your voice
or see your face again
 
The loneliness without you
is beyond belief
I can't come to terms with
this feeling called grief 

It's so hard to describe just how I feel
without you beside me
time has only stood still

I sit for hours in your favourite chair
talk to your photo
wishing you were there
 
I touch your clothes & start to weep
I hug your pillow
& try to sleep
 
Life must go on
I suppose it's true
but a day doesn't pass
without thinking of you
 
To treasure your memory 
I must carry on
but nothing else matters
now that you've gone. 

Heart asleep.
Sorrows pulling me down deep.
The words stuck.
Tongue thick, and sticky, yuck! 
My feet won't move.
Suddenly I've lost my groove.
I seem to speak.
I'm feeling shy and meek.
I don't know what to do, 
but to say four words, 'I love you.

'I want you to know
This.

When I look at the lucent moon
At winter passing my window
I think of the stars in your eyes
And how my love for you, limits the sky.

When I look at the wrinkled logs
The fire holding to them tight
Ambers in my heart ignite
Fireworks that pilot the night.

When I look at the beauty
In the world
I think how it leads
Me to you
As if all this existence
Were but just little boats
That sail my love towards you.

When I look at white candles
That has a deep passion for flame
Endows me with your spiritual presence
My heart you forever claim.

That flame never perishes
But will endlessly burn
For the isles you hold out to me
But eons, I will've yearned.

If you do forget me
And leave only your memory
I will stand the land
Against the wind, 
That tries to fight the flame
For it will always stay alit
Even against the mightiest rains.

I will never forget the angels face
The hands that handled my soul
A smile that spoke more than words
Eyes that lit up the world.

An aroma with blissful scent
That paints a divine place
The artistry of her lips, 
Encourage a warm embrace.



But if you ever feel
That you're destined for me
With saccharine desire, 
If a violin sings your words
And kisses my ears, 
Within me the fire still burns
Nothing extinguished
Winter repeated
Oh my love, oh my own, 
I feed off your affection
For your beauty is my appetite, 
I will thank the allure in the world
For always leading me to you, my girl.


Nor the wind, nor the storms, nor the rain
Could ever kill this always burning flame. 

Once upon a time there was this girl 
This girl always sat in the corner
This girl always got picked last
This girl was always the second if not third choice
This girl always kept her feelings for herself
This girl was always hurt, eventhough
this girl seemed happy
But it wasn't long till
this girl realised that no one but herself
Has the ability
To change that
~If you don't speak for yourself, no one will~
This girl is a fighter
This girl is strong
This girl is you
This girl is me
This girl should be everyone. 

There is this girl I know
She is suffering in pain, through time.
She has a broken heart.
It wishes it could die, but all it does is cry.

I wish this girl could see that she is not alone.
She has him with her, spiritually within her.
I wish her broken heart could see inside of herself then she would know that this rollar coaster of sadness will falter.
When the last chance street car comes to the end, there she will dance again.

Please be honest, I know your not happy, please don't censor your tears, You're the sweet crusador, your the last great innocence and this is why I love you.

The last street car has gone off the tracks but is now heading on the right path.

To the Girl I Know. 

THIS gloomy northern day,
Or this yet gloomier night,
Has moved a something high
In my cold heart; and I,
That do not often pray,
Would pray to-night.

And first on Thee I call
Enough of bread for all, -
That through the famished town
Cold hunger may lie down
With none to-night.

I pray for hope no less,
That to the struggling young
May preach with brazen tongue
Stout Labour, high success,
And bright reward.

For hearts resigned and bold
To trudge the dusty way -
Hearts stored with song and joke
And warmer than a cloak
Against the cold.

If nothing else he had,
He who has this, has all.
This comforts under pain;
This, through the stinging rain,
Keeps ragamuffin glad
Behind the wall.

This makes the sanded inn
A palace for a Prince,
And this, when griefs begin
And cruel fate annoys,
Can bring to mind the joys
Of ages since. 

There's a stone-cold fire in the warm fireplace 
Forever reminding me of my resting place 
Eternal flames burning a hole in my soul 
Breathing new life into my existing role 

There's a fearless wind in the midnight sky 
Forever blowing not knowing how to die 
A full moon beckons to the wolf in me 
Trying desperately to set me free 

There's a lonesome road ahead 
Deserted wraiths left for dead 
Heartbreak Hotel.  

a mirage.  

one more mile to goal 
Comfort for the stirring of this lifeless soul 

Anger fear sadness grief sorrow.  

be aware  
Remnants of ghosts strewn along the road of despair 
Reminders of so many wasted days and wasted nights 
Shadows remaining in darkness searching for brighter lights 

There's a burning flame in the embers of my being 
Director of this wondrous movie of novel living 
The ultimate adventure of mind over matter  
In which Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung batter and scatter  

There's eternal life where once there was darkness.  
And the tongue of light glows with so much brightness.  
And I see Carl Jung and Hermann Hesse playing the glass bead game.  
And the hole in my soul is whole again in this glorious gameThis heart that broke so long—
These feet that never flagged—
This faith that watched for star in vain,
Give gently to the dead—

Hound cannot overtake the Hare
That fluttered panting, here—
Nor any schoolboy rob the nest
Tenderness builded there. 

Tonight my brother, in heavy boots, is walking
through the bare rooms over my head,
opening and closing doors.
What could he be looking for in an empty house?
What could he possibly need there in heaven?
Does he remember his earth, his birthplace set to torches?
His love for me feels like spilled water
running back to its vessel.

At this hour, what is dead is restless
and what is living is burning.

Someone tell him he should sleep now.

My father keeps a light on by our bed
and readies for our journey.
He mends ten holes in the knees
of five pairs of boy's pants.
His love for me is like his sewing:
various colors and too much thread,
the stitching uneven. But the needle pierces
clean through with each stroke of his hand.

At this hour, what is dead is worried
and what is living is fugitive.

Someone tell him he should sleep now. 

This old house has seen the sunshine  
of many different years.  
This old house has seen some happiness  
This old house has seen some tears.  This old house now seems so  
empty  
Since you left with last  
goodbyes.  
The smiles and talk, the  
happy laughs  
Echo above the lonely sighs  Whether leaves are green in springtime  
snow leaves lightly on the ground  
This old house will hold the  
memories  
Of all the old families sounds. 

Eternal Mover, whose diffused Glory,
To shew our groveling Reason what thou art,
Unfolds it self in Clouds of Natures story,
Where Man, thy proudest Creature, acts his part:
Whom yet (alas) I know not why, we call
The Worlds contracted sum, the little all. 

For, what are we but lumps of walking clay?
Why should we swel? whence should our spirits rise
Are not bruit Beasts as strong, and Birds as gay,
Trees longer liv'd, and creeping things as wise?
Only our souls was left an inward light,
To feel our weakness, and confess thy might.

Thou then, our strength, Father of life and death,
To whom our thanks, our vows, our selves we owe,
From me thy tenant of this fading breath,
Accept those lines which from thy goodness flow:
And thou that wert thy Regal Prophets Muse,
Do not thy Praise in weaker strains refuse.

Let these poor Notes ascend unto thy throne,
Where Majesty doth sit with Mercy crown'd,
Where my Redeemer lives, in whom alone
The errours of my wandring life are drown'd:
Where all the Quire of heaven resound the same,
That only Thine, Thine is the saving Name. 

Well then, my Soul, joy in the midst of Pain;
With greater triumph yet return again,
And conquer his own Justice with his Love;
Commanding Earth and Seas to render those
Unto his Bliss, for whom he paid his Woes.

Now have I done: now are my thoughts at peace,
And now my Joyes are stronger then my grief:
I feel those Comforts that shall never cease,
Future in Hope, but present in Belief.
Thy words are true, thy promises are just,
And thou wilt find thy dearly bought in Dust.This is a Blossom of the Brain—
A small—italic Seed
Lodged by Design or Happening
The Spirit fructified—

Shy as the Wind of his Chambers
Swift as a Freshet's Tongue
So of the Flower of the Soul
Its process is unknown.

When it is found, a few rejoice
The Wise convey it Home
Carefully cherishing the spot
If other Flower become.

When it is lost, that Day shall be
Upon his Breast, a closing Soul

This is a poem I wrote before I died and was reborn:
- After the years of the apples ripening and the eagles
    soaring,
After the festival here the small flowers gleamed like the
    first stars,
And the horses cantered and romped away like the 
    experience of skill; mastered and serene
Power, grasped and governed by reins, lightly held by
    knowing hands.

The horses had cantered away, far enough away
So that I saw the horses' heads farther and farther away
And saw that they had reached the black horizon on the
    dusk of day
And were or seemed black thunderheads, massy and
    ominous waves in the doomed sky:
And it was then, for the first time, then that I said as I
    must always say
All through living death of night:
It is always darkness before delight!
The long night is always the beginning of the vivid blossom of day. 

This is a SHOUTING poem.
Not a gentle wildflower poem
not a whispering-of-love poem
A SHOUTING POEM.

This is a POSTER poem.
Not a subtly persuading poem.
not a think-about-it poem
A POSTER POEM

This is a HARD OF HEARING poem.
What? 
I said a HARD OF HEARING POEM

This is a LOST SPECTACLES poem
to test your sight.
No no not LAST TESTICLES
NO TRY THE NEXT LINE -
A LOST SPECTACLES POEM

This is a HAVE YOU SEEN MY? poem.
I know I put it down somewhere.
Are you sure you haven't seen it? 
Oh no, you didn't use it for THAT. ? 
Why are you laughing it's not funny.
I hadn't even finished it. 

This is an ACROSS THE ROOM poem.
Read it while you're in bed
watching TV
doing the ironing
reading the newspapers
putting the new wallpaper up
combing the cat
having a bath
washing the car
talking to the neighbours
gardening
this is an ACROSS THE ROOM POEM

This is a BLOWN ACROSS THE STREET POEM
no need to run after it
and pick it up
just watch it blow
maybe wonder 
if you missed anything


Come at it carefully, don't trust it, that isn't its right name,
It's wearing stolen rags, it's never been washed, its breath
Would look moss-green if it were really breathing,
It won't get out of the way, it stares at you
Out of eyes burnt gray as the sidewalk,
Its skin is overcast with colorless dirt,
It has no distinguishing marks, no I. 

D. cards,
It wants something of yours but hasn't decided
Whether to ask for it or just take it,
There are no policemen, no friendly neighbors,
No peacekeeping busybodies to yell for, only this
Thing standing between you and the place you were headed,
You have about thirty seconds to get past it, around it,
Or simply to back away and try to forget it,
It won't take no for an answer: try hitting it first
And you'll learn what's trembling in its torn pocket.
Now, what do you want to do about it

Even if you see me, with eyes closed, in the shadows; 
I am not sleeping under the light of the dark bulbs.
I am looking at you bewildered by my slow reactions.

On the contrary, I'm very careful when I write; 
Since I can hear the sound of the ants in action, 
And the fall of the small needle on the carpet.

It's an illusion; my senses are fine; I am not dozing.
Listen to the distant echo of the bell ringing, 
And the blood flowing; everything is working.

You can express yourself like revolting peacocks, 
Or like magpies who sadly just lost their crops.
I am protesting: my countrymen are not dogs.

I am not asleep. I can hear your thousand excuses.
You just woke up the anguish of my Muses; 
Thus, I'm looking at you mesmerized like frogs. 

I always wanted to be a hollywood girl. 
dancing in moonlight, swimming in flowers
making love in the rain.
Then my hero came and I thought that I was saved.  

I only had to grab.
But then I hesitated, thought it wasn't real and I doubted his love: 
causing nothing but pain.
Now I've lost the part.
The leading role in love and now I'm lost and sad that's too bad.

Nothing I can do, 
can ever make up for the way I treated you.
Nothing I can say, 
can make the living easy
Take the pain away.
Nothing I can try, is good enough for love.
Nothing I can do, is good enough for you.
This emptiness inside, 
my overbearing selfish pride. 
makes me dread the day I fell in love with you. 
Not because I am so sad, but because I am so bad. 
I dread falling in love with you cos without you, nothingness remains. 

On a peaceful night, the stars are shinning bright. 
Only the whisper of the breeze goes by. A wonderful calm night. 
This is how you make me feel.

A rollar coaster plumeting down from its summit, 
My heart stops and I can't catch my breath, or stomach.
This is how you make me feel.

When a new born baby crys and opens its eyes for the first time. 
It experiences something new.
This is how you make me feel.

When I hear you laugh and see that smile oh what a joy! 
My heart aches, longing for it, The heartache disappears.
This is how you make me feel.

When I crawl under the nice cozy blankets and drink my hot chocolate.
I feel the warmth inside.
This is how you make me feel.

When I walk on the beach, I hear the gulls screeching. ,
But I also hear the ocean calling for me. Could it possibly be you? 
This is how you make me feel.

When you reach out to pull me up when I have fallen down. 
I feel your strength flow one on one.

These are the feelings of being with you.
Happy, 
Accepted, 
Wanted, 
Loved, 
Excited, 
And day by day, I learn something new. I love you! 

This is how you make me feel

This is the life that you dream of
Every night. This is it, this is the love
That took you a long time to aspire.

This is the spring that you desire.
Make the best of it, take a long walk, 
Along the river banks to chat, talk, 
And discuss what troubles you.

This is the winter that few
Have a chance to enjoy; it is fun
To play in the snow. The sun
Is not too hot; inarguably perfect.

This is the autumnal season, 
Where sheets of leaves protect
The green grass; the gazon
Will be well manicured this summer.

This is it; the tulips are breathtakingly
Beautiful. Not too distant from the river, 
Great number of first time lovers
Are entertained by the cacophonic breeze; 
They are also blessed by the intermittent rain showers.

This is it, this is no joke.
This is the life that the scribes spoke
About the other night; 
As always, they were right.

Make the best of today's life, 
Because tomorrow has its rife.
This is it; this is the life that you dreamt of.
Live as if this were the first time that you fall in love.





I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox 

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast 

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold



My name is Love. 

All living beings know me. 
I am the inspiration. 
I do not like separation-
And yes, I do separte too. 
Jealousy and hatred can not defeat me. 
Sometime I wrap myself in madness. 
I like to break waves. 
Try  to fly beyond the ether. 
I am in her bosom and his breast. 
Without me being-ness become dead.

So many events occur
just bcoz of my presence. 
I instigate fighting. Me can stop war too.
Have a read Tolstoy's 'war and peace'. 
Get that or not look at yourselves. 
I have been captivating you all as well. 

I am living 
therefore all beings living here are me.
Great minds can express me.
I am embraced by symbols 
regardless cultural boundaries. 
I am-
Inside the laugh's bedroom
Within the sittingroom of smile. 
You can call me butterfly.



In the wave of cry, 
Inside the very personal whisper of pain I exist.

Holding the door open
The housewife waiting for her hasband's arrival- 
I am in her mind.
Me is come out from children's wide giggling 
And hasband's full attention to his wife's dignity.

Look at the silent stream of tears, I am there. 
I am playing with - father - mother - brother - sister. 
I am here - there - all over. 
You can see me-
In humming birds’s warm kisses. 
Friends can capture me in the radiance of memory's hugs.


Yes, Me is invisible and visible. 
You can say- Love is misty too.
I induce sleep and strike to awake.
The Nature is lovely bcoz of me. 
You can find out me in and out religions.
And I shy and me don’t shy. 

There is nothing that you can compare
I am in prayer 
I am in care
And of course inside the dear’s dare.

Just remember, 
I am here mingled with flesh and spirit. 
No ifs and buts, 

my breath is warm and acrid and  acidic

it is so dangerous just like
the mind of this wounded
man, whose dreams are
buried in his heart, 
unfulfilled, untouched, 
for many many years
in the silence of the desert
in the dryness of the sand
under the fury of the sun

please do not try to listen to the
sounds of dreams exploding

This is my body that you see
Smoothened by His breaths

You will love it and want to have it
To touch and caress 
To be feasted upon by the hunger
Of your eyes and thirst of your lips
To be rubbed by the coldness of your body
Seeking the warmth of my flesh

This is my body that you will first see
But there is more in me than my body
This soul that seeks your soul
This beautiful soul that seeks the beauty of your soul
The hands of my spirit reaching out to your invisible hands
They have all for years been longing to clasp
My soul longing to be with your soul
So they can be together 
To be fused with each other as one 
To be happy and calm and perfect
To that final place where this body
Shies away because something more beautiful
Inside it shines and glows and becomes 
So beautiful in all eternityas a child i was hurt
hurt so deeply with nowhere to tell how hurt i was once
with no other place to bury my tears
to shout my fears
there were no skies above me
there was no moon to confide
there were only walls

i have grown up
through layers and layers of silence
thick silence thicker than the earth of million years
strong and big and always
keen and piercing the walls that i have been used to
i have seen more about life's pains
and felt the dangers 
that i have escaped and survived
i have become a man
and found this hiding place




ON the bed of roses
On the floor of thorns

Under the sun of caresses
On the pathway of splinters

This is my Life
And I am living it. 

Life defines in Metabolism, 
In reproduction, 
we make our miniature selves, 
our look alike
In the power of adaptation, 
like what is in now, 
What is fashionable, 
how I blend with all of you
How I mimic you, 
how I become a clown to you, 

Life in being nice
This is my life A short and a merry one
This my life In the middle of my own life
To life, 
a life, 
in the hope of discovering the meaning of my life, 
Come to life with me
To the life, 
for the life of one like me, 
Not taking this life in my own hands, 
Never, 
never, 
To life, 
this is life
As big as life
as large as life is large
In resiliency, 
in elasticity
Animations, cartooning, animate, 
I vivify
I vilify
I quicken
I liken
The life force in my life’s functions
Drawn from life
to life drawn
Dream to life a life full of dreams
This liveliness, this sparkle
This effervescence of life, 
this bubbling life like wine
This sprightliness like soft
Drink like energy drinks
This verve, 
this vigor
this vivacity
Of life to life as big as life
My life
This is my life
This me I am life
I am energy
i am in this poem trying to run
away from everything in my life, 
running in life
to life and life, 
because of life, 
for life. 

this is my naked self
what you are seeing is my naked truth
i am not ashamed of my flesh and body
you desire it
you touch it
let my senses live
wake me up with the slightest kindness
of your touch

this is my naked self
i am seated bside the open shutters of my  green bay window
little touches of light from the early morning light sketch my shadow
i am here 
long waiting for you
just you my love
my only love

kiss me 
touch me 
let me live for another day


Make me a flower
 delicate and sweet, spewing fragrance
 into the blowing breeze.
Make me a violin
 from whose strings melody flows
 to soothe the ailing nerves.
Make me a rain cloud
sailing over the breadth of skies 
showering cooling droplets  
on to the thirsting mouth of the Earth.
Make me a lamp
 shedding beams of light
dissipating darkness
 from the mazy depths of gloom.
Make me a vessel
 full with love to pour out into empty pitchers.
Make me a barge
 with sails filled by the wind
that in me, I can ferry the sinking souls
to far safer shores of life.

Let every atom of my being
throb with Thy filling love
Let it spring forth in jets 
 to form the gushing stream
Let many drink from that fountain
and taste the sweetness 
of Thy nourishing love
Let the land be watered 
Let the dirt be cleansed
Let the Earth wear a celestial charm 
Let the plants celebrate the carnival of colours
and in my basket shall I gather
many a fragrant bloom
to be offered at your feet with love
and remain squatted in Thy presence, 
not losing in the pageant
 of this transient life. 

This is my voice, 
Sad, prolonged, fever pitched, 
With some intermittent turbulence
In between a concentrated discourse
But
Still in a slow, smooth, sailing like
A canoe on a very clear silent running river
And
Some rapids, and rocks somewhere, may distort, 
This voice
Of mine, 
Or
At the edge for which a waterfall rages, 
This
Voice
Of
Mine, 
May sound like a violent fall of a hundred heavy waters, 
Not a drip, but a hundred heavy, heavy falling waters, 
As though the whole word is falling down
On your
Shoulder, 
This is my voice, sad, on a prolonged agony, 
But somehow, when tickled may move into
A mystery, not discounting the possibility of
An ecstasy, 
A fantasy, 
And you, my love, my beautiful reader, may hear this voice
Speaking to you in a hush of silence, 
This is my voice; hear it for what it is, that is all that I ask of you, 
I am myself speaking. I am real, this voice of mine.
Listen to me. 

This is my world, small as it is, 
It is a planet by itself with very 
Small moons, and tiny stars, 
And so tiny, you cannot just 
See me there, I am hiding, 
But I still live here just the same, 
Breathing atomic air, and drinking 
Molecular waters, so you see, 
How tiny I could be, how tiny 
I could get, but this is my 
Small happy world, my smile 
My laughter so tiny, that you 
Cannot hear, you cannot feel, 

And that is your world as big 
As the sun, with comets and 
Meteors, and so big and so 
Wide, with oceans and rivers, 
And continents, and gigantic 
Arctics, and snowy lands, and 
We are then so different, and 
With me, there is no problem, 
I, in my small world, can fit 
In yours, but you, you cannot 
Fit in mine, that we must 
Accept, I am a small world, 
And you are a space still expanding, 
Now, do you understand, 
 why I hide? 
why I shy away from you

Life is valued with action
Life is merciful we realize
We come with a purpose too
We need to have vision far.

Time is not for to waste
Each beat of life is nice
Every moment we have to do
Nice art works on right law.

This is necessary to feel
We have to judge on action
The path is waiting to hold 

He is creator of this world
He governs and rule through
Mind is set up to uphold sure
We have to mingle with him. 

well, let me be frank
like the sun
oh what about the sun
what's the sun got to do
with us
or this
this is not a case of a poetic
exploration
neither is it an exploitation
nor a molestation of any
metaphoric experience
this is a cause of slaughter
i won't tell you
it is a crime that you have done
against me
you rob me of my heart
you suck my blood like a vampire
heartbreaker

This is the life which is full of care, 
Persons like this attitude are found rare.
Tolerance is too difficult to bear in body, 
Such persons are there to speak truth ready.

To keep nonviolence is hardest task for men, 
Chastity is top quality; difficult for women.
Benevolence bewitches people but to gain hard, 
Still such people are there who tackle with glad.

This is the life where full of risk, 
Some like hardest jobs that have time fix.
Some dislike let up, let down and levity, 
Some like toilsome works to keep away poverty.

This is the life where full of responsibility, 
It maintains discipline but doesn’t reduce liberty.
Such persons are there who like this quality, 

This is the life which makes nation great, 
People are tied in with love and don’t hate.
People like to sacrifice and life is fair. 
This is the life on family is full of care. 

Seems the TVs are spoiling the children, 
Wide screens to baby-sit and console.
No worlds to explore, 
Beyond the back door, 
No life outside of remote control.

Now, the TVs are teaching the children, 
Substitute guidance: Just sit and watch. 
They plop and they slouch, 
Entranced on a couch, 
No time to read or to play hopscotch.

Yes, the TVs are raising the children, 
Kids stare at the screens until dizzy.
At times they’ve become, 
The ns to some, 
As the parents are just too BUSY

this kiss wasn’t just a kiss
this kiss was the demise of eternal bliss
this kiss wasn’t just a second of meaningless feelings
this kiss was the end of priceless beginnings
this kiss wasn’t just a thing you had to do
this kiss was the duration of me and you
this kiss-this kiss-this kiss


WITH how sad steps, O moon, thou climb'st the skies! 
How silently, and with how wan a face! 
What! may it be that even in heavenly place 
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries? 
Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes 
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case: 
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace 
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries. 
Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me, 
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit? 
Are beauties there as proud as here they be? 
Do they above love to be loved, and yet 
   Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? 
   Do they call 'virtue' there--ungratefulness

With Kit, Age  at the Beach


We would climb the highest dune, 
from there to gaze and come down: 
the ocean was performing; 
we contributed our climb. 

Waves leapfrogged and came 
straight out of the storm. 
What should our gaze mean? 
Kit waited for me to decide. 

Standing on such a hill, 
what would you tell your child? 
That was an absolute vista. 
Those waves raced far, and cold. 

"How far could you swim, Daddy, 
in such a storm?" 
"As far as was needed," I said, 
and as I talked, I swam. 

This life is filled with misery.
There is nothing here for me.
My life has nothing, 
so I'm just waiting for something.
Waiting for something big to happen.
Is that a sin? 
I guess so, 
and apparently this life is my foe. 

This Life, which seems so fair,
Is like a bubble blown up in the air
By sporting children's breath,
Who chase it everywhere
And strive who can most motion it bequeath.
And though it sometimes seem of its own might
Like to an eye of gold to be fixed there,
And firm to hover in that empty height,
That only is because it is so light.
But in that pomp it doth not long appear;
For when 'tis most admired, in a thought,
Because it erst was nought, it turns to nought. 

This little bag I hope will prove
To be not vainly made--
For, if you should a needle want
It will afford you aid. 
And as we are about to part
T'will serve another end,
For when you look upon the Bag
You'll recollect your friend


This living hand, now warm and capable
Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold
And in the icy silence of the tomb,
So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights
That thou wouldst wish thine own heart dry of blood
So in my veins red life might stream again,
And thou be conscience-calmed - see here it is -
I hold it towards you. 

she gave me hope and love
just all of the above
from the stars in the sky
to the words of her songs
she gave me Etta and Miles
then i went wild

she gave me hope and love again
then i knew it was love
there was something different about 
this love
there was no limit to 
this love
and that was the difference in 
this love

then she gave me words. 
inspirational, real words
that lifted me up, high into the sky

then she gave me words again
i could not spell what she gave me

but she gave me hope 
and love
and words
and it was a song, 
endless love. 

This man is unfit to lead America
He hates people from Mexico, Syria
India, Iraq, Africa and the Middle East
This candidate is not a man of peace.

This nominee despises Mexicans, women
African Americans, Muslims, Native Americans
Captured or disabled veteran like Mc


Cain
This man is only fit to lead a clan.

This candidate is not fit to be President
He is a groper, a sexual aggressor
America cannot afford to have a leader
Like this crazy bragger, this sleazy pedant.

This man is unfit to govern the United States of America
He despises Muslims, Mexicans, Syrians and Native Americans
This nominee is not qualified to lead a melting pot like America
The home of the Free, the Brave and the Good Samaritans.


Pulsating with life
Bathed in the sunshine
In cool seclusion
Amid shimmering pools of water
Amid spectral trees
The morning with its hues glides
Awakening the nature from her sleep
The restless birds on the tree-tops
Are shaking their wings
And a new plant 
Quite alien to the garden
Flowering bees
And butterflies this morning
Daisies, clover and buttercup
All soaring up and gliding
Down to grassy heaven
And tiny souls
Like a fleet of ants
Seen in a lovely array
searching for grain
Oh! what a lively morning
Everyone looked primed 
And had their lamps lit
To the occasion they are rising


I had some time this morning that clarified my mind
The thoughts that drifted past me were of a quiet and gentle kind
I'm not saying I'm in love with you, I'm just saying that I find
That thoughts keep drifting past me of a quiet and gentle kind.

The feelings that I'm having are not easy to explain
It’s been some time since I've been in this newly loving game
It's all slow moving on now and I really can't explain
The rules that we should follow in this newly loving game.

I took the time this afternoon to write my thinking down
And all the time I wondered why and let my mind go round
Around and around the time we've spent and what I feel I've found
It took some time, I wondered why and said my thoughts aloud. 

Then I ripped up the paper and I threw it on the floor
The words that I had written were like trying to keep a score
I'd tried to use my reasonings as I had done before
And the marks upon that paper had no meaning anymore. 

The way that all this seems to me is not easy to explain
It’s been some time since I've been in this newly loving game
It's all slow moving on now and I really can't explain
The rules that we should follow in this newly loving game.

I spent some time this evening thinkin' of just who I am
What I like about me and what is it that I can
Offer up to someone who, when all this thing began, 
Was not needing of lover nor even of a man.

Yes, we do have common interests and we can talk for hours
We share a love of poets and a questioning of power
We hold each other closely even though we're wondering how
This thing that we are making could be completely ours.

The feelings that I have for you are not easy to explain
It’s been some time since I've been in this newly loving game
It's all slow moving on now and I really can't explain
The rules that we should follow in this newly loving game.

There is a lack of time for us and some hurt within our hearts
And that got me on to thinking that our paths are really hard.
The time I took to think today was 'bout us being apart
And the way we are beginning yet not knowing how to start.

The feelings that I have now are not easy to explain
It’s been some time since I've been in this newly loving game
It's all slow moving on now and I really can't explain
The rules that we should follow in this newly loving game. 

Yasuhara Teishitsu
destroyed all but three

of his
haiku

leaving us with less
than of his words.

self critical
to a fault

leaves us the saying
of the unsayable.

*******

KORE WA KORE WA TO BAKARI HANA NO YOSHINO YAMA

"Ah! Ah! Ah! & "Ah! " all
I can say.  

breath taken away
as Yoshino blossoms! 

For Basho this was "the finest hokku ever written." 

Mt. Yoshino has four groves of white mountain cherry trees and for three days in April the hill blossoms with an intenseness of white. To behold such a sight.  

and once beheld.  

to try to pour its wonder into words.  

how to say the unsayable! The original first line has an irregular six-syllable first line so I have made all my lines irregular as if broken by the beauty before them. 

Quell these demons, 
the thoughts inside, 
release that hunger that, 
burning need, 
what ethereal fire, 
drives this unwanted feeling? 
What demon burns, 
within my mind? 
a driving need, 
hazing my thoughts, 
this that frosts judgement, 
more than the strongest liqour, 
what demon burns, 
in my mind? 
Driving my thoughts, 
back.  Back.  Back. 
The same ancient feeling, 
over again, 
never stopping, 
never slowing, 
fogging my thoughts, 
penetrating my dreams, 
what demon must, 
burn within me? 
Never a moments peace. 

We appeared
in the turned off T. 

V screen

our reflections
moving like shadows

in a lost dimension
of another world.

Outside was nothing
but Summer

innocently happening 
to itself.

Everything in our years
compelling us to this

kiss

as if all life
was just this

single second

Each molecule of you
blossoming into each molecule of me

until there was
no me no you no more

just this
coming together

as if our lives
unravelled backward

to our very first
beginnings

then once again
thrusting itself forward

each of us a sperm
rushing blindly to an egg

to fashion
this Future

that is this only
.  Now. 

Of  this  passing time, 
A day is certainly very short, 
Other times, a minute is so very long.
Living and dreaming..
Of mountains  with clear flowing creeks, 
Come to think of it..
Why are my  ideas  so very dry now? 
As dry as the desert of Rajasthan! 
Oh! .. let me dream again, 
Of wild flowers growing  and blooming, 
Up in the cool high plateau, 
Embraced by the visiting soft low clouds, 
Leaving  little droplets of life's ether-
Giver and receiver, 
Without fail, making passionate promises..
to meet again and again, 
In a natural cycle of life

Oh Dear father we get essence
In this beautified nature
Your amazing creation is
Eagerly this is expressive.

So many flowers bloom a day
We inhale fragrance for joy
Learning art of love we sing
Bounty of fortune speaks us.

Golden rays and pink roses 
We see with beautiful petals
These are sprinkled in far sky 
What an amazing imagery we see.

So much of love is gathered for
We find and realize peace near
Peaceful morning sings within
Your merciful light touches us. 

THIS pig went to market; 
This pig stayed at home; 

This pig had a bit of meat; 
And this pig had none; 

This little pig cried 
Wee! wee! wee! 
I can't find my way home. 

This poem
was about to speak to you
assuming that there is a you right there and now
but 
hesitated, a little unsure of itself

this poem
though all ready to be
a bouncy, Tiggerish, extravert sort of poem
is going instead to take a quiet moment for
introspection

this poem
remembers that computers are essentially
binary – built up of  millions of yes-no choices
so

this poem
is above all, 
yes; 
hoping 
in still a Tiggerish way, to hear you also, say
yes

this poem
finds that it has
certain hidden desires
which it rightly or wrongly
was going to lay on you
like

this poem
would like to tell you
something new which
you might or might not believe
until some time later
when you’d say
yes! 

this poem
would like to touch your heart
(impertinently assuming
you might need aortic massage)       
so that when you finished reading it, 
you’d say
yes! 

this poem
presumptuously
would like to enable you to
see the whole world with fresh eyes, 
as if never before, 
be the first day
of Creation for the
rest of your life
so that you'd say
yes yes yes

this poem
would love to 
be Irish, throw magical, spellbinding words round you
like two hands throwing wild flowers
over you in a summer meadow, 
looking into your eyes, laughing, kissing, 
dancing over the green hills to blue skies hand in hand
enchanted with a life you’d passing forgotten, 
always known, while time
is eternity and
you and I and all things are
yes, yes, yes and
yes

this poem
at this point
introspectively with a touch of humility
thinks
maybe it’s sufficient, purer, 
just to want to
pass you in the street, 
smile right into your eyes
maybe shake hands, even
kiss both cheeks how ever many times
and know that without necessarily
saying anything
the answer’s
yes

this poem
hopes it’s made its point
without mentioning
love or other well-known, 
complicated things like that and
moreover it’s gone on long enough
because

this poem loves
what happens in silence
what happens in stillness
and just wanted to say 

yes

This poem is not for you
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
There are many poems
Full of pathos
Full of loves
Full of emotions
Imagine what if you don't come
Heaven waits
Earth wails
Century flies
And time speechless
After sweeping up the heart
What remains? 
Love a conjecture
And your turning up
An uncertainty
Until we meet eternity
Better select one
That best fits to you 
Since this poem is not for you- 

I chanced upon a thought today
A thought that would not go away
What if heaven's like here on earth? 
More like a parallel universe? 
So, people live in houses there
And go to work and comb their hair
And sleep at night and make love too
And eat and drink, go to the loo
A heaven marked by being mundane
And then i had that thought again
We're just on earth for life's extent
In heaven no end's imminent
Alive for ever in the clouds
But would we all be wearing shrouds? 
I somehow think not for i'd guess
We'd all be doing what we do best
So deceased tailors would make clothes
And gardeners still gardens grow
Accountants would still cook the books
And chefs would be eternal cooks
But wait! i see some contradiction
Apparent even in this fiction
Someone just dead would rub their shoulders
With others who would be much older
Imagine if this came to pass
Newton could meet Pythagoras
Krushchev could lecture Kant and Hegel
While Ben Gurion just fed them bagels
Bach could learn to play the blues
Beethoven could wear blue suede shoes
Henry Ford could meet Ferrari
At Andy Warhol's dinner parties
Da Vinci could meet Wittgenstein
And discuss theories with Einstein
Would all be mixed up at that table
A final thought then came to me
This prospect seems quite heavenly. 

Lie still now
while I prepare for my future,
certain hard days ahead,
when I'll need what I know so clearly this moment.

I am making use
of the one thing I learned
of all the things my father tried to teach me:
the art of memory.

I am letting this room
and everything in it
stand for my ideas about love
and its difficulties.

I'll let your love-cries,
those spacious notes
of a moment ago,
stand for distance.

Your scent,
that scent
of spice and a wound,
I'll let stand for mystery.

Your sunken belly
is the daily cup
of milk I drank
as a boy before morning prayer. 

The sun on the face
of the wall
I can't see, my soul,

and so on, each thing
standing for a separate idea,
and those ideas forming the constellation
of my greater idea.
And one day, when I need
to tell myself something intelligent
about love,

I'll close my eyes
and recall this room and everything in it:
My body is estrangement.
This desire, perfection.
Your closed eyes my extinction.
Now I've forgotten my
idea. The book
on the windowsill, riffled by wind. 
the even-numbered pages are
the past, the odd-
numbered pages, the future.
The sun is

useless, useless. 
your cries are song, my body's not me. 
no good
my idea
has evaporated.  

your hair is time, your thighs are song. 
it had something to do
with death.  

it had something
to do with love. 

This rose - red, scented, rich, without price  –
is it speaking to me? 
I cannot hear what it says. And yet-

is it watching me? 
it does not blink. And yet-

is it urging me to action? 
it gives no sign. And yet-

this rose – so gloriously – is-

so does it know all this? 
is it beyond all this? 

for while I watch it
and wait for an answer
I know myself more.

perhaps the rose
is not the answer
but the question
and I the answer
and the answerer


This sea of tears is a vast wasteland
That a maiden burdens with an imprinted hand
Creating swells and blustery typhoons
Breaking the core of the harvest moon
Causing the tides to differ and change
Producing the sea to painfully rain
Currents of the sea try to catch the maiden
Storms of the skies have forsaken
The sea, for the maiden loved the sky
And this sea of tears could do nothing but cry.(for Llewelyn)

This side of the truth,
You may not see, my son,
King of your blue eyes
In the blinding country of youth,
That all is undone,
Under the unminding skies,
Of innocence and guilt
Before you move to make
One gesture of the heart or head,
Is gathered and spilt
Into the winding dark
Like the dust of the dead.

Good and bad, two ways
Of moving about your death
By the grinding sea,
King of your heart in the blind days,
Blow away like breath,
Go crying through you and me
And the souls of all men
Into the innocent
Dark, and the guilty dark, and good
Death, and bad death, and then
In the last element
Fly like the stars' blood

Like the sun's tears,
Like the moon's seed, rubbish
And fire, the flying rant
Of the sky, king of your six years.
And the wicked wish,
Down the beginning of plants
And animals and birds,
Water and Light, the earth and sky,
Is cast before you move,
And all your deeds and words,
Each truth, each lie,
Die in unjudging love. 

They think outside the box, 
Because they fail to think within
Forced to forge another box, 
To put the first one in

Questions dressed with arrogance, 
Answers in disguise 
Truth they take out of the box, 
To keep the lie alive

Their eyes are ever searching
Yet fails to see a spark
Although the stars burn brightly
They much prefer the dark

Yet, in the other corner life! 
And so they build another box, 
To put themselves inside

In a coffin of denial 
Creation seals their fate
And as they now think in the box, 
They see it is too late


The sunset
Vibrant, bright
Full of colors
Just before night
Deep red, violet purple
The colors fairly
Glow with beauty 
This night, I say verily, 
It is truly a wonderful
Sight


This time, I am not asking you to go out.
I am not asking you, my angel, to be with me.
Tonight, 
That's right, 
I am going to lie back like a dummy, 
Who is speechless and who has no clout.
The ball is in your corner; 
The ball is in your court.
It is evident that I am not too short
To play, and to shoot right at the center.
This time, I am neither asking
Nor begging; I am praying. 

This time of year a twelvemonth past, 
When Fred and I would meet, 
We needs must jangle, till at last 
We fought and I was beat. 

So then the summer fields about, 
Till rainy days began, 
Rose Harland on her Sundays out 
Walked with the better man. 

The better man she walks with still, 
Though now 'tis not with Fred: 
A lad that lives and has his will 
Is worth a dozen dead. 

Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather, 
And clay's the house he keeps; 
When Rose and I walk out together 
Stock-still lies Fred and sleeps. 

This unimportant morning
Something goes singing where
The capes turn over on their sides
And the warm Adriatic rides
Her blue and sun washing
At the edge of the world and its brilliant cliffs.

Day rings in the higher airs
Pure with cicadas, and slowing
Like a pulse to smoke from farms,

Extinguished in the exhausted earth, 
Unclenching like a fist and going.

Trees fume, cool, pour - and overflowing
Unstretch the feathers of birds and shake
Carpets from windows, brush with dew
The up-and-doing: and young lovers now
Their little resurrections make. 

And now lightly to kiss all whom sleep
Stitched up - and wake, my darling, wake.
The impatient Boatman has been waiting
Under the house, his long oars folded up
Like wings in waiting on the darkling lake. 

You and I will take a trip 
To somewhere we have never been before
We will visit the hut with the golden door
And the blue lake so you and I can dip
Our bodies and souls in the heaven
Of love that only you and I can invent
You and I will create our own event
Our own fantasy: a delicious turkey in the oven
A bottle of wine, one glass, one knife, 
One fork, one towel and one inflated bed
That’s the recipe of a wonderful life
You and I, alone, in a place that looks dead
You and I are playfully sharing each other
The butterflies are away, the birds are singing
The weather is very nice and inviting
And you and I are under the same cover.


This was not our destiny, that union with the beloved would take place.
If we had kept on living longer, then would have been kept waiting

If I lived on your promise, then know this that I knew it to be false
For would I not have died of happiness, if I had had trust [in it]? 

From your delicacy I knew that the vow had been bound loosely
You could never have broken it, if it had been firm

Let someone ask my heart about your half-drawn arrow
Where would this anxiety/ pain have come from, if it had gone through the liver? 

What kind of friendship is this, that friends have become Advisors? 
If someone had been a healer, if someone had been a sympathizer! 

From the rock-vein would drip that blood which would never have stopped
If this which you are considering 'grief' this were just a spark

Although grief is life-threatening, how would we escape, while there is a heart? 

If there were not the grief of passion, there would be the grief of livelihood

To whom might I say what it is- the night of sadness is a bad disaster! 
Why would I have minded dying, if it took place one time? 

Since upon having died, I became disgraced- why were I not drowned in the ocean? 
Neither a funeral procession would ever been formed, nor would there anywhere be a tomb

Who can see him? for that Oneness is unique
If there were even a whiff of twoness, then somehow [He] would be two or four

These problems of mysticism! this discourse of yours, Ghalib! 
We would consider you a saint- if you weren't a wine-drinker. 

Why say I love you, 
When you really don’t care, 
Why say hello, 
When you really mean goodbye.

Don’t tell me your feelings, 
Did you ever have them, 
Why hold my hand gently, 
When you meant to crush my heart.

Don’t write me poetry, 
It was meant for another, 
Don’t look into my eyes, 
Coz it was always lies.

Why do you say---
I was  "going to---"
When you never meant to start, 
Now promise me, 
You’ll be true, 
Tell me all this was not true.




Dear Aldrich, now November's mellow days
Have brought another Festa round to you,
You can't refuse a loving-cup of praise
From friends the fleeting years have bound to you. 

Here come your Marjorie Daw, your dear Bad Boy,
Prudence, and Judith the Bethulian,
And many more, to wish you birthday joy,
And sunny hours, and sky caerulean! 

Your children all, they hurry to your den,
With wreaths of honour they have won for you,
To merry-make your threescore years and ten.
You, old? Why, life has just begun for you! 

There's many a reader whom your silver songs
And crystal stories cheer in loneliness.
What though the newer writers come in throngs?
You're sure to keep your charm of only-ness. 

You do your work with careful, loving touch, --
An artist to the very core of you, --
You know the magic spell of "not-too-much ":
We read, -- and wish that there was more of you. 

And more there is: for while we love your books
Because their subtle skill is part of you;
We love you better, for our friendship looks
Behind them to the human heart of you. 

November   


II 

MEMORIAL SONNET 

THIS is the house where little Aldrich read 
The early pages of Life's wonder-book: 
With boyish pleasure, in this ingle-nook 
He watched the drift-wood fire of Fancy spread 
Bright colours on the pictures, blue and red:
Boy-like he skipped the longer words, and took
His happy way, with searching, dreamful look 
Among the deeper things more simply said. 

Then, came his turn to write: and still the flame
Of Fancy played through all the tales he told, 
And still he won the laurelled poet's fame
With simple words wrought into rhymes of gold.
Look, here's the face to which this house is frame, --
A man too wise to let his heart grow old

Part First

Ancient

True Thomas lay on Huntlie bank; 
A ferlie he spied wi' his ee; 
And there he saw a lady bright, 
Come riding down by the Eildon Tree. 

Her skirt was o the grass-green silk, 
Her mantle o the velvet fyne, 
At ilka tett of her horse's mane 
Hang fifty siller bells and nine. 

True Thomas he pulld aff his cap, 
And louted low down to his knee: 
For thy peer on earth I never did see.' 

'O no, O no, Thomas,' she said, 
'That name does not belang to me; 
That am hither come to visit thee. 

'Harp and carp, Thomas,' she said, 
'Harp and carp, along wi' me, 
And if ye dare to kiss my lips, 
Sure of your bodie I will be!' 

'Betide me weal, betide me woe, 
That weird sall never daunton me; 
Syne he has kissed her rosy lips, 
All underneath the Eildon Tree. 

'Now, ye maun go wi me,' she said, 
'True Thomas, ye maun go wi me, 
And ye maun serve me seven years, 
Thro weal or woe as may chance to be.' 

She mounted on her milk-white steed, 
She's taen True Thomas up behind, 
And aye wheneer her bride rung, 
The steed flew swifter than the wind. 

O they rade on, and farther on - 
The steed gaed swifter than the wind - 
Until they reached a desart wide, 
And living land was left behind. 

'Light down, light down, now, True Thomas, 
And lean your head upon my knee; 
Abide and rest a little space, 
And I will shew you ferlies three. 

'O see ye not yon narrow road, 
So thick beset with thorns and briers? 
That is the path of righteousness, 
Tho after it but few enquires. 

'And see ye not that braid braid road, 
That lies across that lily leven? 
That is the path of wickedness, 
Tho some call it the road to heaven. 

'And see not ye that bonny road, 
That winds about the fernie brae? 
That is the road to fair Elfland, 
Where thou and I this night maun gae. 

'But, Thomas, ye maun hold your tongue, 
Whatever ye may hear or see, 
For, if you speak word in Elflyn land, 
Ye'll neer get back to your ain countrie.' 

O they rade on, and farther on, 
And they waded thro rivers aboon the knee, 
And they saw neither sun nor moon, 
But they heard the roaring of the sea. 

It was mirk mirk night, and there was nae stern light, 
And they waded thro red blude to the knee; 
For a' the blude that's shed an earth 
Rins thro the springs o that countrie. 

Syne they came on to a garden green, 
And she pu'd an apple frae a tree: 
'Take this for thy wages, True Thomas, 
It will give the tongue that can never lie.'

'My tongue is mine ain,' True Thomas said, 
'A gudely gift ye wad gie me! 
I neither dought to buy nor sell, 
At fair or tryst where I may be. 

'I dought neither speak to prince or peer, 
Nor ask of grace from fair ladye:' 
'Now hold thy peace,' the lady said, 
'For as I say, so must it be.' 

He has gotten a coat of the even cloth, 
And a pair of shoes of velvet green, 
And till seven years were gane and past 
True Thomas on earth was never seen. 


Part Second


When seven years were come and gane,
The sun blink'd fair on pool and stream;
And Thomas lay on Huntlie bank,
Like one awaken'd from a dream.

He heard the trampling of a steed,
He saw the flash of armour flee,
And he beheld a gallant knight
Come riding down by the Eildon Tree.

He was a stalwart knight, and strong;
Of giant make he 'pear'd to be:
He stirr'd his horse, as he were wode,
Wi' gilded spurs, of faushion free.

Says - 'Well met, well met, true Thomas!
Some uncouth ferlies show to me.'-
Thrice welcome, good Dunbar, to me!

'Light down, light down, Corspatrick brave!
And I will show thee curses three,
Shall gar fair Scotland greet and grane,
And change the green to the black livery.

'A storm shall roar this very hour, 
From Ross's hills to Solway sea.'-
'Ye lied, ye lied, ye warlock hoar!
For the sun shines sweet on fauld and lee.'-

He put his hand on the Earlie's head;
He show'd him a rock beside the sea,
Where a king lay stiff beneath his steed,
And steel-dight nobles wiped their ee.

'The neist curse lights on Branxton hills;
By Flodden's high and heathery side,
Shall wave a banner red as blude,
And chieftains throng wi' meikle pride.

'A Scottish King shall come full keen,
The ruddy lion beareth he;
A feather'd arrow sharp, I ween,
Shall make him wink and warre to see.

'When he is bloody, and all to bledde,
Thus to his men he still shall say -
And give yon southern folk a fray!
Why should I lose, the right is mine?
My doom is not to die this day.'

'Yet turn ye to the eastern hand,
And woe and wonder ye sall see;
How forty thousand spearmen stand,
Where yon rank river meets the sea.

'There shall the lion lose the gylte,
And the libbards bear it clean away;
At Pinkyn Cleuch there shall be spilt
Much gentil bluid that day.'-

'Enough, enough, of curse and ban;
Some blessings show thou now to me,
Or, by the faith o' my bodie,' Corspatrick said,
'Ye shall rue the day ye e'er saw me!'-

'The first of blessings I shall thee show,
Is by a burn, that's call'd of bread;
Where Saxon men shall tine the bow,
And find their arrows lack the head.

'Beside that brigg, out ower that burn,
Where the water bickereth bright and sheen,
Shall many a fallen courser spurn,
And knights shall die in battle keen.

'Beside a headless cross of stone,
The libbards there shall lose the gree;
The raven shall come, the erne shall go,
And drink the Saxon bluid sae free.
The cross of stone they shall not know,
So thick the corses there shall be.'-

'But tell me now,' said brave Dunbar,
'True Thomas, tell now unto me,
What man shall rule the isle of Britain,
Even from the north to the southern sea?'-

Shall rule all Britain to the sea;
He of the Bruce's blood shall come,
As near as in the ninth degree.

'The waters worship shall his race;
Likewise the waves of the farthest sea;
For they shall ride over ocean wide,
With hempen bridles, and horse of tree.'


Part Third.


When seven years more were come and gone,
Was war through Scotland spread,
And Ruberslaw show'd high Dunyon
His beacon blazing red.

Then all by bonny Coldingknow,
Pitch'd palliouns took their room,
And crested helms, and spears a-rowe,
Glanced gaily through the broom.

The Leader, rolling to the Tweed,
Resounds the ensenzie;
They roused the deer from Caddenhead,
To distant Torwoodlee.

The feast was spread in Ercildoune,
In Learmont's high and ancient hall:
And there were knights of great renown,
And ladies, laced in pall.

Nor lacked they, while they sat at dine,
The music nor the tale,
Nor goblets of the blood-red wine,
Nor mantling quaighs of ale. 

True Thomas rose, with harp in hand,
When as the feast was done:
(In minstrel strife, in Fairy Land,
The elfin harp he won).

Hush'd were the throng, both limb and tongue,
And harpers for envy pale;
And arm'd lords lean'd on their swords,
And hearken'd to the tale.

In numbers high, the witching tale
The prophet pour'd along;
No after bard might e'er avail
Those numbers to prolong.

Yet fragments of the lofty strain
Float down the tide of years,
As, buoyant on the stormy main,
A parted wreck appears.

He sung King Arthur's Table Round:
The Warrior of the Lake;
How courteous Gawaine met the wound,
And bled for ladies' sake.

But chief, in gentle Tristrem's praise,
The notes melodious swell;
Was none excell'd in Arthur's days,
The knight of Lionelle.

For Marke, his cowardly uncle's right 
A venom'd wound he bore;
When fierce Morholde he slew in fight,
Upon the Irish shore.

No art the poison might withstand;
No medicine could be found,
Till lovely Isolde's lily hand
Had probed the rankling wound.

With gentle hand and soothing tongue
She bore the leech's part;
And, while she o'er his sick-bed hung,
He paid her with his heart.

O fatal was the gift, I ween!
For, doom'd in evil tide,
His cowardly uncle's bride.

Their loves, their woes, the gifted bard
In fairy tissue wove;
Where lords, and knights, and ladies bright,
In gay confusion strove.

The Garde Joyeuse, amid the tale,
High rear'd its glittering head;
And Avalon's enchanted vale
In all its wonders spread.

Brangwain was there, and Segramore,
And fiend-born Merlin's gramarye;
Of that famed wizard's mighty lore,
O who could sing but he?

Through many a maze the winning song
In changeful passion led,
Till bent at length the listening throng
O'er Tristrem's dying bed.

His ancient wounds their scars expand,
With agony his heart is wrung:
O where is Isolde's lilye hand,
And where her soothing tongue?

She comes! she comes! - like flash of flame
Can lovers' footsteps fly:
She comes! she comes! - she only came
To see her Tristrem die.

She saw him die; her latest sigh
Join'd in a kiss his parting breath,
The gentlest pair that Britain bare,
United are in death.

There paused the harp: its lingering sound
Died slowly on the ear;
The silent guests still bent around,
For still they seem'd to hear.

Then woe broke forth in murmurs weak:
Nor ladies heaved alone the sigh;
But, half ashamed, the rugged cheek
Did many a gauntlet dry.

On Leader's stream, and Learmont's tower,
The mists of evening close;
In camp, in castle, or in bower,
Each warrior sought repose.

Dreamed o'er the woeful tale;
When footsteps light, across the bent,
The warrior's ears assail.

He starts, he wakes; - 'What, Richard, ho!
Arise, my page, arise!
What venturous wight, at dead of night,
Dare step where Douglas lies!'-

Then forth they rush'd: by Leader's tide,
A selcouth sight they see-
A hart and hind pace side by side,
As white as snow on Fairnalie.

Beneath the moon, with gesture proud,
They stately move, and slow;
Nor scare they at gathering crowd,
Who marvel as they go. 

To Learmont's tower a message sped,
As fast as page might run;
And Thomas startled from his bed,
And soon his clothes did on.

First he woxe pale, and then woxe red;
Never a word he spake but three;-
'My sand is run; my thread is spun;
This sign regardeth me.'

The elfin harp his neck around,
In minstrel guise, he hung;
And on the wind, in doleful sound,
Its dying accents rung.

Then forth he went; yet turn'd him oft 
To view his ancient hall:
On the grey tower, in lustre soft,
The autumn moonbeams fall;

And Leader's waves, like silver sheen,
Danced shimmering in the ray;
In deepening mass, at distance seen,
Broad Soltra's mountains lay.

'Farewell, my fathers' ancient tower!
A long farewell,' said he:
'The scene of pleasure, pomp, or power,
Thou never more shalt be.

'To Learmont's name no foot of earth
Shall here again belong,
And, on thy hospitable hearth,
The hare shall leave her young.

'Adieu! adieu!' again he cried,
All as he turn'd him roun'-
'Farewell to Leader's silver tide!
Farewell to Ercildoune!'

The hart and hind approach'd the place,
As lingering yet he stood;
With them he cross'd the flood.

And spurr'd him the Leader o'er;
But, though he rode with lightning speed,
He never saw them more.

Soem said to hill, and some to glen,
Their wondrous course had been;
But ne'er in haunts of living men
Again was Thomas seen. 

STUDY IN WHITES 
Wax-white— 
Floor, ceiling, walls. 
Ivory shadows 
Over the pavement 
Polished to cream surfaces 
By constant sweeping. 
The big room is coloured like the petals 
Of a great magnolia, 
And has a patina 
Of flower bloom 
Which makes it shine dimly 
Under the electric lamps. 
Chairs are ranged in rows 
Like sepia seeds 
Waiting fulfilment. 
The chalk-white spot of a cook’s cap 
Moves unglossily against the vaguely bright wall— 
Dull chalk-white striking the retina like a blow 
Thru the wavering uncertainty of steam. 
Vitreous-white of glasses with green reflections, 
Ice-green carboys, shifting—greener, bluer—with the jar of moving water. 
Jagged green-white bowls of pressed glass 
Rearing snow-peaks of chipped sugar 
Above the lighthouse-shaped castors 
Of grey pepper and grey-white salt. 
Grey-white placards: "Oyster Stew, Cornbeef Hash, Frankfurters": 
Marble slabs veined with words in meandering lines. 
Dropping on the white counter like horn notes 
Through a web of violins, 
The flat yellow lights of oranges, 
The cube-red splashes of apples, 
In high plated epergnes. 
The electric clock jerks every half-minute: 
"Coming!—Past!" 
"Three beef-steaks and a chicken-pie," 
Bawled through a slide while the clock jerks heavily. 
A man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair. 
Two rice puddings and a salmon salad 
Are pushed over the counter; 
The unfulfilled chairs open to receive them. 
A spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone, 
And the sound throws across the room 
Sharp, invisible zigzags 
Of silver. 

Of almost bare, the derriere
of women wearing underwear
that covers little, I would sing, 
and thongs that are designed to cling
to buttocks closer than a panty, 
no longer scandalous though scanty.

As with impunity I peek, 
I glimpse the glory of a cheek
that's framed by threads that grace the groin
and turn it into tenderloin, 
for less is more and life is merrier
when thin lines hemisect the derriere.

hongs are not a meshugas, 
they’re cords that are extremely scanty
which draw attention to the ass
far more than a more prudish panty.
If you’re a Puritan you must
such forms of lingerie eschew, 
as well you ought if you’re a Jew, 
you may disparage them as naughty, 
but that’s what Jews who’re horny wish
once they are getting close to forty, 
and hoping for a treyfah dish, 
and by the time that they are three-
score years and ten a lass
must wear a thong or she won’t be
their missionary meshugas.

Inspired by Maureen Dowd’s tribute to William Safire in the NYT, September  
During the Clinton impeachment circus, I walked by William Safire’s lair. He had an imposing office in "murderers’ row, " as he dubbed the hall where we worked, full of English antiques, Oriental rugs and a couple of old ties he kept for those rare moments when he needed one. He was sitting in an armchair reading that bodice-ripping best seller, The Starr Report. "There’s a word here I don’t know, " said The Times’s wordsmith. "What is a thong? " I flushed and stammered that it was a scanty panty with a string for the back. His hazel eyes glinted with curiosity. Trying to elucidate, I blurted: "Maybe you’re thinking of thong sandals, where thong is an adjective. With Monica, it’s used as a noun." He smiled. "It’s like a G-string, " he said. "That brings back memories of some clubs I went to as a young man in Union City, N. 

J." 
Bill Safire was anything but a nattering nabob of negativity. He had none of the vile and vitriol of today’s howling pack of conservative pundits: Limbaugh, Beck, Coulter and Malkin. Even though we disagreed on the Iraq war, he chastised me only once about it, for writing that Cheney & Co. had shoehorned all their "meshugas" about Saddam’s W. 

M. 

D. and Al Qaeda links into Colin Powell’s U. 

N. speech. "Mishegoss, " he wrote in his language column, would have been a better spelling of the word

He would have appreciated the fact that his obits ran on Yom Kippur. He had a famous dinner every year at his home in Chevy Chase, Md., to break the fast that gathered many of the city’s most influential players. Curious, I pestered him for years for an invite. He patiently explained it was just for Jews or people who were, or had been, married to Jews. After years of pleading, including many protestations that I had had Jewish boyfriends and that I would one day find a Jewish husband, he broke down and let me come. He was a mensch. And that’s no mishegoss. 


e sighing said, "Our Pan is dead; 
His pipe hangs mute beside the river 
Around it wistful sunbeams quiver, 
But Music's airy voice is fled. 
Spring mourns as for untimely frost; 
The bluebird chants a requiem; 
The willow-blossom waits for him; 
The Genius of the wood is lost
 


Then from the flute, untouched by hands, 
There came a low, harmonious breath: 
"For such as he there is no death; 
His life the eternal life commands; 
Above man's aims his nature rose. 
The wisdom of a just content 
Made one small spot a continent 
And turned to poetry life's prose. 

"Haunting the hills, the stream, the wild, 
Swallow and aster, lake and pine, 
To him grew human or divine, 
Fit mates for this large-hearted child. 
Such homage Nature ne'er forgets, 
And yearly on the coverlid 
'Neath which her darling lieth hid 
Will write his name in violets. 

"To him no vain regrets belong 
Whose soul, that finer instrument, 
Gave to the world no poor lament, 
But wood-notes ever sweet and strong. 
O lonely friend! he still will be 
A potent presence, though unseen, 
Steadfast, sagacious, and serene; 
Seek not for him -- he is with thee

"There´s no wind along these seas,
Out oars for Stavanger!
Forward all for Stavanger!
So we must wake the white-ash breeze.
Let fall for Stavanger!
A long pull for Stavanger!

Oh, hear the benches creak and strain!
(A long pull for Stavanger!)
She thinks she smells the Northland rain!
(A long pull for Stavanger !)

She thinks she smells the Northland snow,
And she's as glad as we to go.

She thinks she smells the Northland rime,
And the dear dark nights of winter-time.

She wants to be at her own home pier,
To shift her sails and standing gear.

She wants to be in her winter-shed,
To strip herself and go to bed.

Her very bolts are sick for shore,
And we—we want it ten times more!

Send us a three-reef gale again!

Send us a gale, and watch us come,
With closecropped canvas slashing home!

But—there’s no wind on all these seas,
A long pull for Stavanger!
So we must wake the white-ash breeze,
A long pull for Stavanger

Thorn bushes have Roses
They're good for one who proposes
Put in a bouquet
The thorns are OK
They don't hurt people's noses


Would it be easy if winter was warmer, 
Snow came down in summer so hot? 
Would we realise the worth of a rainfall, 
Would the wait be worth a shot? 

I stand against a well lit wall, 
I stare at a void dark blind
My puny thorns are growing inwards, 
Don’t look at them if you be so kind

Sooner or later, I will flourish

These annual bills! these annual bills!
How many a song their discord trills
Of 'truck' consumed, enjoyed, forgot,
Since I was skinned by last year's lot!

Those joyous beans are passed away;
Those onions blithe, O where are they?
Once loved, lost, mourned-now vexing ILLS
Your shades troop back in annual bills!

And so 'twill be when I'm aground
These yearly duns will still go round,
While other bards, with frantic quills,
Shall damn and damn these annual bills

With tears i write this haltingly
i cannot see i cannot breathe
while those that are born of my seed
are far from me.

I want to touch i want to see
the hands the hair the honesties
that unlike flickered memories last
moths in a flame and floating past
are hosts and hosts of glorious gold
the tales the sights the thoughts untold
the did you did i stories when
you hold onto the moments then
you smile and laugh and closely say
i am happy that you are that way.

With grief i write this haltingly
i cannot cry i cannot feel
while those that are born of my seed
are not with me. 

Come, let me sing into your ear;
Those dancing days are gone,
All that silk and satin gear;
Crouch upon a stone,
Wrapping that foul body up
In as foul a rag:
I carry the sun in a golden cup.
The moon in a silver bag.

Curse as you may I sing it through;
What matter if the knave
That the most could pleasure you,
The children that he gave,
Are somewhere sleeping like a top
Under a marble flag?
I carry the sun in a golden cup.
The moon in a silver bag.

I thought it out this very day.
Noon upon the clock,
A man may put pretence away
Who leans upon a stick,
May sing, and sing until he drop,
Whether to maid or hag:
I carry the sun in a golden cup,
The moon in a silver bag. 

I remember trekking 
To our old primary school
That stands in the same place today
Its walls still the way they were
Earth bricks beaten by weather
I remember the assembly ground
Where our teeth and nails 
Were inspected for personal hygiene
And the culprits whose buttock 
Saw lashes of cane.

I remember the harmattan time 
When we rubbed water
Instead of bathing with it
And the chiggers that deformed our toes 
In the sand we frolicked 
I remember stealing moi moi
From my mother's pot 
And placing it on my head
Wearing my papa's cap.

I remember my 
Hook, line and sinker
Dragged by a tillapia
That I  pulled onshore
Panting like a mountain
Racer on Obudu ranch race
I remember my stuttering 
Teacher teaching us 
How to pronounce hipopotamus
Hip!  Hip! !  Hip! ! ! 
And we ended up saying 
Hurray

They'd flock from the Valley's and Hillsides, 
From the neighbouring towns and afar, 
Down to Barry Island, 
Young children, with Ma and Pa.

The trains would be overflowing, 
And many would have to stand, 
Laden with sarnies and drinks for the day, 
Those days, were happy and grand! 

They'd rush from the station in Barry, 
And head for their favourite spot, 
Pick up a few deck chairs on the way, 
For a sit on the beach where it's hot.

A lovely day spent by the seaside, 
To the Fairground, to finish the day! 
All polished off, with a nice Fish and Chips! 
And, fond memories to take away. 

I saw. .	
Two black crystal balls
Rimmed with white
Reflecting an indefinable emotion
Glowing with some intense passion

Riveting  
Entrancing! 

Two eyes of oceanic depths
Relaying the most intimate message
"I love you" (?) 

So piercing were those eyes
That I couldn't stand their electric glare
From those eyes, rose the Promethean fire
Glistening like molten gold
At once sending out
The light of a hundred galaxies

From the fire bursting through those eyes
My body was turned into a conflagration
And my soul rippled like fermented wine

An ocean was stirring within 
Whose whirls could never again be tamed
In those flooding pools
Let me cast my fishing net

Those golden days of Summer, 
That I remember well, 
Sweet daisy chains and buttercups, 
Enchanted by it's spell.
A pure place of paradise, 
Those days were so much fun, 
To roam amongst the bluebells, 
To hop, to skip, to run.
Those early years of childhood, 
Filled with pleasant dreams, 
Of butterflies and ladybirds, 
Rainbows and sunbeams.
Those golden days of summer, 
A pleasant tale to tell, 
A fairy tale of childhood, 
How I remember well. 

WHAT if I bade you leave
The cavern of the mind?
There's better exercise
In the sunlight and wind.
I never bade you go
To Moscow or to Rome.
Renounce that drudgery,
Call the Muses home.
Seek those images
That constitute the wild,
The lion and the virgin,
The harlot and the child
Find in middle air
An eagle on the wing,
Recognise the five
That make the Muses sing. 

Lost amongst a sea of faces, 
The day has dawned, 
A young heart races, 
Summer holidays are over, 
It's back to school, 
Girls looking chic! 
Boys acting cool! 
Then mixed with the bunch, 
The bully appears, 
With menacing grin, 
Some poor boys in tears, 
He roams the school playground, 
To spoil someone's day, 
Like a Buzzard he waits, 
To stake out his prey, 
It's a time to be noticed, 
A time to fit in, 
Days we remember, 
Where friendships begin, 
We look back and wonder, 
How did we survive? 
But those old school days, 
Were the best days of our lives

Those Olden, Golden Days! (A Rondel of lines) 

'Those olden, golden days' she said, 
'Recalled can be only in mind.
For ever they've been left behind
And won't return, for they are dead.

We therefore can but look ahead
At days to come, cruel or kind.
Those olden, golden days', she said, 
'Recalled can be only in mind.

Those days of yore, to values wed -
Though all the clocks we backward wind -
Will stage no 'comeback'.  None can find
Them, eternally having fled
Those olden, golden days', she said. 

That certain way you called my name, 
If only to hear your voice again, 
Our conversations on the phone, 
Are in the past, for now you're gone.

I have a picture in my book, 
And love to sit and take a look, 
We're on the beach, upon the sand, 
Bucket and spade, in my hand.

We look so happy, special days, 
If only to have them back again, 
Your picture hangs upon my wall, 
You look so well, no pain at all.
I held your hand right to the end, 
My lovely Mum, my special friend 

I know you're always close to me, 
No matter what life brings, 
I'll treasure our time together, 
Remember, those special things. 

We can never go back to those special years, 
A time of fun, a time so dear, 
Left with long lost memories, 
Remembering those special years.

Of twinkling lights that graced the tree, 
With stockings hanging on the bed, 
Longing for those gifts ahead! 

A special time with loved ones dear, 
Faces now, no longer here, 
Happy times, when they were near, 
Left behind, to those special years. 

That tree said
I don't like that white car under me,
it smells gasoline
That other tree next to it said
O you're always complaining
you're a neurotic
you can see by the way you're bent over. 

Memories, 
Of the way we were, 
Faded photographs, 
Hostages in Iran, 
Interested rates out of the roof, 
Mortgage rates galore, 
Billy Beer and so much more. 

Democrats, 
Oh that is the memories I adore, 
Interest rates soar, 
Almost hitting , 
Gas Lines, Gas Shortages, 
Crashed helicopters in the desert, 
And there is so much more! 

Democrats, 
Energy crisis is here, 
However, never you fear, 
Wear a sweater, 
Oh, it won't help but 
You will feel so much better! 

Democrats, 
Controlled the House, 
Controlled the Senate, 
Controlled the White House, 
Those are the Memories I remember. 

How many of us would trade those good old days 
For today? 
To quote the raven, ' Nevermore! ' 

Memories, 
If this is what some celebrities forgot to mention, 
I believe it does need to draw our attention. 
The old liberal democratic policies 
Are tired- this true, 
However, we should remember this, 
They were not good for me and you

A crippled child
Said, "How shall I dance?"
Let your heart dance
We said. 

Then the invalid said:
"How shall I sing?"
Let your heart sing
We said 

Then spoke the poor dead thistle,
But I, how shall I dance?"
Let your heart fly to the wind
We said. 

"How shall I descend from the blue?"
Come dance for us here in the light
We said. 

All the valley is dancing
Together under the sun,
And the heart of him who joins us not
Is turned to dust, to dust.जो उड़ते हैं
जरूरी नहीं वो पक्षी ही हों

जो दो पांवों पर चलते हों
जरूरी नहीं आदमी हों.

(मूल लेखक श्री विष्णु नागर) 



Those who fly  
Are not essentially the birds; 

Those who walk on their two legs,  
Are not essentially the human beings.
 
We turned, departing from that solemn sight:
A contrast and reproach to gross delight,
And life's unspiritual pleasures daily wooed!
But now upon this thought I cannot brood;
It is unstable as a dream of night;
Nor will I praise a cloud, however bright,
Disparaging Man's gifts, and proper food.
Grove, isle, with every shape of sky-built dome,
Though clad in colours beautiful and pure, 
Find in the heart of man no natural home:
The immortal Mind craves objects that endure:
These cleave to it; from these it cannot roam,
Nor they from it: their fellowship is secure. 

So one in heart and thought, I trow,
That thou might'st press the strings and I might draw the bow
And both would meet in music sweet,
Thou and I, I trow. 

She substituted, by a chance,
For empty 'you' - the gentle 'thou';
And all my happy dreams, at once,
In loving heart again resound.
In bliss and silence do I stay,
Unable to maintain my role:
'Oh, how sweet you are!' I say -
'How I love thee!' says my soul. 

Thou art not false, but thou art fickle,
To those thyself so fondly sought;
The tears that thou hast forced to trickle
Are doubly bitter from that thought:
'Tis this which breaks the heart thou grievest 
Too well thou lov'st - too soon thou leavest.

The wholly false the heart despises,
And spurns deceiver and deceit;
But she who not a thought disguises,
Whose love is as sincere as sweet,
When she can change who loved so truly,
It feels what mine has felt so newly.

To dream of joy and wake to sorrow
Is doom'd to all who love or live;
And if, when conscious on the morrow,
We scarce our fancy can forgive,
That cheated us in slumber only,
To leave the waking soul more lonely,

What must they feel whom no false vision,
But truest, tenderest passion warm'd?
Sincere, but swift in sad transition; 
As if a dream alone had charm'd?
Ah! sure such grief is fancy's scheming,
And all thy change can be but dreaming

Thou blind man's mark, thou fool's self chosen snare, 
Fond fancy's scum, and dregs of scatter'd thought, 
Band of all evils, cradle of causeless care, 
Thou web of will,whose end is never wrought. 

Desire, desire I have too dearly bought, 
With price of mangled mind thy worthless ware, 
Too long, too long asleep thou hast me brought, 
Who should my mind to higher things prepare. 

But yet in vain thou hast my ruin sought, 
In vain thou madest me to vain things aspire, 
In vain thou kindlest all thy smoky fire. 

For virtue hath this better lesson taught, 
Within myself to seek my only hire: 
Desiring nought but how to kill desire. 

Thou hast dove eyes, thou hast dove eyes.
Candle lit on your footsteps.
Horses leaped behind you with zest.
Fire swept passed your eye brows.
Dove made nest near your eyes.

Slender, slender, blue indeed.
Like an orphan, I've lost my need to be loved by parents, 
Or even read. 
What use are there in books, 
What else are there to be learned, but your eye lids? 
Say to the horizon, love has good vision.
Say to the mountains, love has heights.

I saw you through my instincts, 
No I didn't look.
Who can face your eyes? 
Who can even think? 
Portion of love, stars and the moon.
I look and search but your eyes stood beneath the view.
It was dark when I saw you, love eyes, did they saw me too? 
Yellow flowers blossomed, yellow morning too.

Dove flew near me yesterday, 
Dove and butterflies.
I think I saw your eyes, dove, and it gave me butterflies.
Strolling along the stream, I saw a silver strip in the sky, 
Darling I miss you, I saw you in the sky. 

I smiled that smile
an inward smile
thine eyes with that shine
when I pledged with mine, 
thou did 
touchhhhhhhhe me.

O, heart of my heart, 
when in peaceful dreams 
my life thou filled
like gentle breeze 
of morning moves
like choral pulses
rings in air
thou
wer’t friend number one
on friendship’s boat
now 
on planet’s love of my heart
thy place is first.

My heartfelt secrets 
thou hath shared
and given me 
thy trust and love, 
Showed me 
to laugh and play
made me wise 
and happier 
to smile and 
love and see again.
Thy stars of wisdom
guideth their light on me.

Who cares 
for that moonshine? 
Let it fade and fall
For me it wont matter at all
For when I have you
I have my sunshine
No need that moonshine
When thou art mine

Each day, 
each hour, 
be it known, 
im destined for thee, I feel.
The rose that climbeth to 
seek my lips
exploding like bushfire, 
Not to be extinguished, 
or forgotten, 
like that star 
one dusky 
tempestuous night
when wanted to 
spread her locks of light
a spiteful cloud
doth hide her sight.
Let thy love, 
feed on mine, beloved.
As long as I live, 
Till age snows 
white hairs on me
thou wilt live in my heart.

If life for me
be parting gift
And I no longer 
you doth see
Shall always be 
your dying love
Cause thou hath
touchhhhhhhhhhed me.
Thou, 
my
valentine 
first love
my last
there wont be 
another love
cause ive pledged
my heart to thee

Gaza
Crying, burning, bleeding and stripping
On the soil of the supreme holiness
On the land of the universal benevolence

Human form transforming
To ravenous beasts
Mighty eating the meek
Today
Cruelty is at its peak

What can be the cause? 
Where we went wrong? 
Intentionally or accidentally
In the dark sea
Of our lustful desires

Oil, money, land, skins, power
And the man-made religion
Burning in our heads
And

Bleeding to death


Jan  Memorial for Dylan Thomas


I 
They are murdering all the young men. 
For half a century now, every day, 
They have hunted them down and killed them. 
They are killing them now. 
At this minute, all over the world, 
They are killing the young men. 
They know ten thousand ways to kill them. 
Every year they invent new ones. 
In the jungles of Africa, 
In the marshes of Asia, 
In the deserts of Asia, 
In the slave pens of Siberia, 
In the slums of Europe, 
In the nightclubs of America, 
The murderers are at work. 


They are stoning Stephen, 
They are casting him forth from every city in the world. 
Under the Welcome sign, 
Under the Rotary emblem, 
On the highway in the suburbs, 
His body lies under the hurling stones. 
He was full of faith and power. 
He did great wonders among the people. 
They could not stand against his wisdom. 
They could not bear the spirit with which he spoke. 
He cried out in the name 
Of the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness. 
They were cut to the heart. 
They gnashed against him with their teeth. 
They cried out with a loud voice. 
They stopped their ears. 
They ran on him with one accord. 
They cast him out of the city and stoned him. 
The witnesses laid down their clothes 
At the feet of a man whose name was your name— 
You. 


You are the murderer. 
You are killing the young men. 
You are broiling Lawrence on his gridiron. 
When you demanded he divulge 
The hidden treasures of the spirit, 
He showed you the poor. 
You set your heart against him. 
You seized him and bound him with rage. 
You roasted him on a slow fire. 
His fat dripped and spurted in the flame. 
The smell was sweet to your nose. 
He cried out, 
"I am cooked on this side, 
Turn me over and eat, 
You 
Eat of my flesh." 


You are murdering the young men. 
You are shooting Sebastian with arrows. 
He kept the faithful steadfast under persecution. 
First you shot him with arrows. 
Then you beat him with rods. 
Then you threw him in a sewer. 
You fear nothing more than courage. 
You who turn away your eyes 
At the bravery of the young men. 


You, 
The hyena with polished face and bow tie, 
In the office of a billion dollar 
Corporation devoted to service; 
The vulture dripping with carrion, 
Carefully and carelessly robed in imported tweeds, 
Lecturing on the Age of Abundance; 
The jackal in double-breasted gabardine, 
Barking by remote control, 
In the United Nations; 
The vampire bat seated at the couch head, 
Notebook in hand, toying with his decerebrator; 
The autonomous, ambulatory cancer, 
The Superego in a thousand uniforms; 
You, the finger man of behemoth, 
The murderer of the young men. 

II 
What happened to Robinson, 
Who used to stagger down Eighth Street, 
Dizzy with solitary gin? 
Where is Masters, who crouched in 
His law office for ruinous decades? 
Where is Leonard who thought he was 
A locomotive? And Lindsay, 
Wise as a dove, innocent 
As a serpent, where is he? 
Timor mortis conturbat me. 


What became of Jim Oppenheim? 
Lola Ridge alone in an 
Icy furnished room? Orrick Johns, 
Hopping into the surf on his 
One leg? Elinor Wylie 
Who leaped like Kierkegaard? 
Sara Teasdale, where is she? 
Timor mortis conturbat me. 


Where is George Sterling, that tame fawn? 
Phelps Putnam who stole away? 
Jack Wheelwright who couldn’t cross the bridge? 
Donald Evans with his cane and 
Monocle, where is he? 
Timor mortis conturbat me. 


John Gould Fletcher who could not 
Unbreak his powerful heart? 
Bodenheim butchered in stinking 
Squalor? Edna Millav who took 
Her last straight whiskey? Genevieve 
Who loved so much; where is she? 
Timor mortis conturbat me. 


Harry who didn’t care at all? 
Hart who went back to the sea? 
Timor mortis conturbat me. 


Where is Sol Funaroff? 
What happened to Potamkin? 
Isidor Schneider? Claude Mc


Kay? 
Countee Cullen? Clarence Weinstock? 
Who animates their corpses today? 
Timor mortis conturbat me. 


Where is Ezra, that noisy man? 
Where is Larsson whose poems were prayers? 
Where is Charles Snider, that gentle 
Bitter boy? Carnevali, 
What became of him? 
Carol who was so beautiful, where is she? 
Timor mortis conturbat me. 

III 
Was their end noble and tragic, 
Like the mask of a tyrant? 
Like Agamemnon’s secret golden face? 
Indeed it was not. Up all night 
In the fo’c’sle, bemused and beaten, 
Bleeding at the rectum, in his 
Pocket a review by the one 
Colleague he respected, "If he 
Really means what these poems 
Pretend to say, he has only 
One way out—." Into the 
Hot acrid Caribbean sun, 
Into the acrid, transparent, 
Smoky sea. Or another, lice in his 
Armpits and crotch, garbage littered 
On the floor, gray greasy rags on 
The bed. "I killed them because they 
Were dirty, stinking Communists. 
I should get a medal." Again, 
Another, Simenon foretold, 
His end at a glance. "I dare you 
To pull the trigger." She shut her eyes 
And spilled gin over her dress. 
The pistol wobbled in his hand. 
It took them hours to die. 
Another threw herself downstairs, 
And broke her back. It took her years. 
Two put their heads under water 
In the bath and filled their lungs. 
Another threw himself under 
The traffic of a crowded bridge. 
Another, drunk, jumped from a 
Balcony and broke her neck. 
Another soaked herself in 
Gasoline and ran blazing 
Into the street and lived on 
In custody. One made love 
Only once with a beggar woman. 
He died years later of syphilis 
Of the brain and spine. Fifteen 
Years of pain and poverty, 
While his mind leaked away. 
One tried three times in twenty years 
To drown himself. The last time 
He succeeded. One turned on the gas 
When she had no more food, no more 
Money, and only half a lung. 
One went up to Harlem, took on 
Thirty men, came home and 
Cut her throat. One sat up all night 
Talking to H. L. Mencken and 
Drowned himself in the morning. 
How many stopped writing at thirty? 
How many went to work for Time? 
How many died of prefrontal 
Lobotomies in the Communist Party? 
How many arc lost in the back wards 
Of provincial madhouses? 
How many on the advice of 
Their psychoanalysts, decided 
A business career was best after all? 
How many are hopeless alcoholics? 
Rene Crevel! 
Jacques Rigaud! 
Antonin Artaud! 
Mayakofsky! 
Essenin! 
Robert Desnos! 
Saint Pol Roux! 
Max Jacob! 
All over the world 
The same disembodied hand 
Strikes us down. 
Here is a mountain of death. 
A hill of heads like the Khans piled up. 
The first-born of a century 
Slaughtered by Herod. 
Three generations of infants 
Stuffed down the maw of Moloch. 

IV 
He is dead. 
The bird of Rhiannon. 
He is dead. 
In the winter of the heart. 
He is Dead. 
In the canyons of death, 
They found him dumb at last, 
In the blizzard of lies. 
He never spoke again. 
He died. 
He is dead. 
In their antiseptic hands, 
He is dead. 
The little spellbinder of Cader Idris. 
He is dead. 
The sparrow of Cardiff. 
He is dead. 
The canary of Swansea. 
Who killed him? 
Who killed the bright-headed bird? 
You did, you son of a bitch. 
You drowned him in your cocktail brain. 
He fell down and died in your synthetic heart. 
You killed him, 
Oppenheimer the Million-Killer, 
You killed him, 
Einstein the Gray Eminence. 
You killed him, 
Havanahavana, with your Nobel Prize. 
You killed him, General, 
Through the proper channels. 
You strangled him, Le Mouton, 
With your mains etendues. 
He confessed in open court to a pince-nezed skull. 
You shot him in the back of the head 
As he stumbled in the last cellar. 
You killed him, 
Benign Lady on the postage stamp. 
He was found dead at a Liberal Weekly luncheon. 
He was found dead on the cutting room floor. 
He was found dead at a Time policy conference. 
Henry Luce killed him with a telegram to the Pope. 
Mademoiselle strangled him with a padded brassiere. 
Old Possum sprinkled him with a tea ball. 
After the wolves were done, the vaticides 
Crawled off with his bowels to their classrooms and quarterlies. 
When the news came over the radio 
You personally rose up shouting, "Give us Barabbas!" 
In your lonely crowd you swept over him. 
Your custom-built brogans and your ballet slippers 
Pummeled him to death in the gritty street. 
You hit him with an album of Hindemith. 
You stabbed him with stainless steel by Isamu Noguchi, 
He is dead. 
He is Dead. 
Like Ignacio the bullfighter, 
At four o’clock in the afternoon. 
At precisely four o’clock. 
I too do not want to hear it. 
I too do not want to know it. 
I want to run into the street, 
Shouting, "Remember Vanzetti!" 
I want to pour gasoline down your chimneys. 
I want to blow up your galleries. 
I want to burn down your editorial offices. 
I want to slit the bellies of your frigid women. 
I want to sink your sailboats and launches. 
I want to strangle your children at their finger paintings. 
I want to poison your Afghans and poodles. 
He is dead, the little drunken cherub. 
He is dead, 
The effulgent tub thumper. 
He is Dead. 
The ever living birds are not singing 
To the head of Bran. 
The sea birds are still 
Over Bardsey of Ten Thousand Saints. 
The underground men are not singing 
On their way to work. 
There is a smell of blood 
In the smell of the turf smoke. 
They have struck him down, 
The son of David ap Gwilym. 
They have murdered him, 
The Baby of Taliessin. 
There he lies dead, 
By the Iceberg of the United Nations. 
There he lies sandbagged, 
At the foot of the Statue of Liberty. 
The Gulf Stream smells of blood 
As it breaks on the sand of Iona 
And the blue rocks of Canarvon. 
And all the birds of the deep sea rise up 
Over the luxury liners and scream, 
"You killed him! You killed him. 
You son of a bitch."THOU that know'st for whom I mourn, 
And why these tears appear, 
That keep'st account till he return 
Of all his dust left here ; 
As easily Thou might'st prevent, 
As now produce, these tears, 
And add unto that day he went 
A fair supply of years. 
But 'twas my sin that forc'd Thy hand 
To cull this primrose out, 
That by Thy early choice forewarn'd 
My soul might look about. 
O what a vanity is man ! 
How like the eye's quick wink 
His cottage fails ; whose narrow span 
Begins even at the brink ! 
Nine months thy hands are fashioning us, 
And many years—alas !— 
Ere we can lisp, or ought discuss 
Concerning Thee, must pass ; 
Yet have I known Thy slightest things, 
A feather, or a shell, 
A stick, or rod, which some chance brings 
The best of us excel ; 
Yea, I have known these shreds outlast 
A fair-compacted frame, 
And for one twenty we have past 
Almost outlive our name. 
Thus hast Thou plac'd in man's outside 
Death to the common eye, 
That heaven within him might abide, 
And close eternity ; 
Hence youth, and folly, man's first shame, 
Are put unto the slaughter, 
And serious thoughts begin to tame 
The wise man's madness, laughter. 
Dull, wretched worms ! that would not keep 
Within our first fair bed, 
But out of Paradise must creep 
For ev'ry foot to tread ! 
Yet had our pilgrimage been free, 
And smooth without a thorn, 
Pleasures had foil'd eternity, 
And tares had chok'd the corn. 
Thus by the cross salvation runs ; 
Affliction is a mother 
Whose painful throes yield many sons, 
Each fairer than the other. 
A silent tear can pierce Thy throne, 
When loud joys want a wing ; 
And sweeter airs stream from a groan, 
Than any arted string. 
My loss but little to it ; 
Yet something more I must entreat, 
And only Thou canst do it. 
O let me—like him—know my end ! 
And be as glad to find it : 
And whatsoe'er Thou shalt commend, 
Still let Thy servant mind it ! 
Then make my soul white as his own, 
My faith as pure and steady, 
Thou hast crown'd him already 

THOUGH all the fates should prove unkind,
Leave not your native land behind.
The ship, becalmed, at length stands still;
The steed must rest beneath the hill;
But swiftly still our fortunes pace
To find us out in every place.

The vessel, though her masts be firm,
Beneath her copper bears a worm;
Around the cape, across the line,
Till fields of ice her course confine;
It matters not how smooth the breeze,
How shallow or how deep the seas,
Whether she bears Manilla twine,
Or in her hold Madeira wine,
Or China teas, or Spanish hides,
In port or quarantine she rides;
Far from New England's blustering shore,
New England's worm her hulk shall bore,
And sink her in the Indian seas,
Twine, wine, and hides, and China teas. 

You Know I always love. 
 
The way you hold my hands..

 it has so much warmth. 
The way you hug me.  And rub my back. 

 

it has so much comfort.  Worth more than million dollars. 
When I go wrong -

 you correct me straight.  
When I cry -
-- you brace me.
When I scream out of frustration, 

 You calm me down. 
When I am Silly-

 You point it specific, to make me wise.
When I am dejected-

 You stand for me in prayers.
When I laugh, 

 You smile with me, seeing me happy.  
When I join bad friends, 

 You have been too strict in pulling me out.  

Your love for me is pure as white.
You have been my best friend.  
You have been my guide-
I don't know when it happened.. 
I don't know when you came into my life.  
But when I turn back.  You have been with me --
This journey has been really long- and I know
This journey will continue till the end-

We are so different - by Color, Family and - everything- 
I can never be like you. 
No one would say I am yours. 
People could say - we have none in common, for you to call me as yours. 
But - I am sure you know we have a big love in us for each other.  
No physical eye could see this- because LOVE is so pure..
it's from bottom of our hearts. 
We never met by an accident, it's all for a purpose.
I love you mummaaa





THOUGH narrow be that old Man's cares, and near,
The poor old Man is greater than he seems:
For he hath waking empire, wide as dreams;
An ample sovereignty of eye and ear.
Rich are his walks with supernatural cheer;
The region of his inner spirit teems
With vital sounds and monitory gleams
Of high astonishment and pleasing fear.
He the seven birds hath seen, that never part,
Seen the SEVEN WHISTLERS in their nightly rounds, 
And counted them: and oftentimes will start--
For overhead are sweeping GABRIEL'S HOUNDS
To chase for ever, on aerial grounds

Which made that shorten'd span one long disease,
Yet merciful in chastening, gave thee scope
For mild, redeeming virtues, Faith and Hope;
Meek Resigination; pious Charity
And, since this world was not the world for thee,
Far from thy path removed, with partial care,
Strife, Glory, Gain, and Pleasure's flowery snare,
Bade Earth's temptations pass thee harmless by,
And fix'd on Heaven thine unadverted eye!
Oh! mark'd from birth, and nurtur'd for the skies!
In youth, with more than learning's wisdom, wise!
As sainted martyrs, patient to endure!
Simple as unweari'd infancy and pure!
Pure from all stain (save that of human clay,
By mortal sufferings now no more oppress'd,
Mount sinless Spirit, to thy destined rest!
While I--reversed our nature's kindlier doom
Pour forth a father's sorrows on thy tomb. 

Though times presses and prods me on
Each hour with greater fray
To give back to the clay
My tired worn limbs and sore
But he will yet do more
Who saddens my soul yet so glad makes.
Nor does it seem he'll pardon
- he who unlocks my heart or bars the way -
In the hours just before
And most doubtful if to peace I'll reawake;
that the usual mistake,
The older I grow gets ever worse.
O harsher is mine than any cruel curse!
to lighten my burdens it's late for you;
A heart that burns, for years burnt through,
Turns, should reason slack the whole,
Not heart again but ash and charcoal. 

Though you are wise, be as a fool; 
Though you can see, be as one blind; 
Though you can hear, be as one deaf; 
Patiently bear with all you meet, 
and politely talk to eveyone. 
This practice surely will lead you 
to the realisation of the Truth. 

What is a thought meant to be, 
But a hazardous waste of collected memory, 
Twisted and embellished into clarity, 
To complacently fall into sanity.

Who can understand enough to categorize, 
The emotion that looms in the depths of the wise, 
That animate all and light up the eyes, 
That stir and trouble the sensitive cries, 
Enshrined in a forgotten isle of lies, 
Precariously navigated by the reader of skies, 
Awakening the artist, who anxiously sighs, 
Confronted by a reality he ardently denies, 
In an idyllic stupor of creativity he lies, 
The expanse of Beauty he tragically espies, 
Vainly piercing the conceited disguise, 
Of the unseen friends that secretly chastise, 
Bane of the thorny rose that withers and dies, 
Discarding shards of memory, the poet replies, 
Hoping to perceive this catatonic prize, 
As hope crumbles insipidly into demise, 
Abandoning humanity with mournful goodbyes. 

Show me the order of the world,
the hard-edge light of this-is-so
prior to all experience
and common to both world and thought,
no model, but the truth itself.

  Language is not a perfect game,
  and if it were, how could we play?
  The world's more than the sum of things
  like moon, sky, centre, body, bed,
  as all the singing masters know.

  Picture two lovers side by side
  who sleep and dream and wake to hold
  the real and imagined world
  body by body, word by word
  in the wild halo of their thought. 

thoughtless thoughts



life is nothing  but just thoughts flowing in our head
it is what we are thinking till we are dead
those thoughts become us and we are given a name
which gives no clue of what we became


we do things which we are meant to do
thoughtless, thoughtful false and true
we fight with all our might into the blue
our feelings, emotions subdue

cracking mirrors, hungry children
burning trees, happy dolphins
cervical cancer, beauty tips
suicide bombers, fish and chips


our thoughts are formed within a blink
does it matter what we think
the world turns around without our appraisal
as we look for light in the abyssal

as we live and continue to see
we can fight and win but never be free
from the thoughts that make us and break us
and from beauty, love and living we digress


If I walk the noisy streets,
Or enter a many thronged church,
Or sit among the wild young generation,
I give way to my thoughts. 
I say to myself: the years are fleeting,
And however many there seem to be,
We must all go under the eternal vault,
And someone

s hour is already at hand. 
When I look at a solitary oak
I think: the patriarch of the woods.
It will outlive my forgotten age
As it outlived that of my grandfathers?. 
If I dandle a young infant,
Immediately I think: farewell!
I will yield my place to you,
For I must fade while your flower blooms. 
Each day, and every hour
I habitually follow in my thoughts,
Trying to guess from their number
The year which brings my death. 
And where will fate send death to me?
In battle, in my travels, or on the seas?
Or will the neighbouring valley
Receive my chilled ashes? 
And although to the senseless body
It is indifferent wherever it rots,
Yet close to my beloved countryside
I still would prefer to rest. 
And let it be, beside the grave

s vault
That young life forever will be playing,
And impartial, indifferent nature
Eternally be shining in beauty. 

When I can make my thoughts come forth 
To walk like ladies up and down, 
Each one puts on before the glass 
Her most becoming hat and gown.

But oh, the shy and eager thoughts 
That hide and will not get them dressed, 
Why is it that they always seem 
So much more lovely than the rest

Some thoughts I entertain.
Some fill me with distain.
Some cause me consternation
And despair.
Some fill me with delight
My heart begins to sing
And I love everything. 

I searched for those delicate words, 
To paint a vivid picture of ecstasy.
Fairytales and moist dreams encircled my heart
And powerful libido reigned my solitary soul..
It was pitch dark all around, 
As intense pain enshrouded my thoughts, 
And small drops of tears 
Thus began to rain, 
Keeping the unfinished poem
Drowned in your lost love, 
With failed efforts of the broken pen! 

Life is the largest  school where we find very few learners


HOW vainly men themselves amaze 
To win the palm, the oak, or bays, 
And their uncessant labours see 
Crown'd from some single herb or tree, 
Whose short and narrow-verged shade 
Does prudently their toils upbraid; 
While all the flowers and trees do close 
To weave the garlands of repose! 

Fair Quiet, have I found thee here, 
And Innocence thy sister dear? 
Mistaken long, I sought you then 
In busy companies of men: 
Your sacred plants, if here below, 
Only among the plants will grow: 
Society is all but rude 
To this delicious solitude. 

No white nor red was ever seen 
So amorous as this lovely green. 
Fond lovers, cruel as their flame, 
Cut in these trees their mistress' name: 
Little, alas! they know or heed 
How far these beauties hers exceed! 
Fair trees! wheres'e'er your barks I wound, 
No name shall but your own be found. 

When we have run our passions' heat, 
Love hither makes his best retreat: 
The gods, that mortal beauty chase, 
Still in a tree did end their race; 
Apollo hunted Daphne so 
Only that she might laurel grow; 
And Pan did after Syrinx speed 
Not as a nymph, but for a reed. 

What wondrous life in this I lead! 
Ripe apples drop about my head; 
The luscious clusters of the vine 
Upon my mouth do crush their wine; 
The nectarine and curious peach 
Into my hands themselves do reach; 
Stumbling on melons, as I pass, 
Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass. 

Meanwhile the mind from pleasure less 
Withdraws into its happiness; 
The mind, that ocean where each kind 
Does straight its own resemblance find; 
Yet it creates, transcending these, 
Far other worlds, and other seas; 
Annihilating all that 's made 
To a green thought in a green shade. 

Here at the fountain's sliding foot, 
Or at some fruit-tree's mossy root, 
Casting the body's vest aside, 
My soul into the boughs does glide; 
There, like a bird, it sits and sings, 
Then whets and combs its silver wings, 
And, till prepared for longer flight, 
Waves in its plumes the various light. 

Such was that happy Garden-state 
While man there walk'd without a mate: 
After a place so pure and sweet, 
What other help could yet be meet! 
But 'twas beyond a mortal's share 
To wander solitary there: 
Two paradises 'twere in one, 
To live in Paradise alone. 

How well the skilful gard'ner drew 
Of flowers and herbs this dial new! 
Where, from above, the milder sun 
Does through a fragrant zodiac run: 
And, as it works, th' industrious bee 
Computes its time as well as we. 
How could such sweet and wholesome hours 
Be reckon'd, but with herbs and flowers

Athwart the bed
I watch the moonbeams cast a trail
So bright, so cold, so frail,
That for a space it gleams
Like hoar-frost on the margin of my dreams.
I raise my head, --
The splendid moon I see:
Then droop my head,
And sink to dreams of thee --
My Fatherland, of thee

They in their cruel traps, and we in ours, 
Survey each other’s rage, and pass the hours 
Commiserating each the other’s woe, 
To mitigate his own pain’s fiery glow. 
Man could but little proffer in exchange 
Save that his cages have a larger range. 
That lion with his lordly, untamed heart 
Has in some man his human counterpart, 
Some lofty soul in dreams and visions wrapped, 
But in the stifling flesh securely trapped. 
Gaunt eagle whose raw pinions stain the bars 
That prison you, so men cry for the stars! 
Some delve down like the mole far underground, 
(Their nature is to burrow, not to bound), 
Some, like the snake, with changeless slothful eye, 
Stir not, but sleep and smoulder where they lie. 
Who is most wretched, these caged ones, or we, 
Caught in a vastness beyond our sight to see

her ams around my upper body-
 mine around her lower,  
we whispered, laughed 
(almost kissed!)    
but didn’t and no further; 
 "I don’t want to, " she said.
 "use your body, " for 
I’ve the body of a male, 
but identify otherwise.
 "and I’m straight."
 well we continued to whisper, laugh, 
(and almost-kiss)  

  at four, she went back to her dorm. I’m glad 
she did. Friendship’s welcome
is warmer.
I snuggled to myself 
with an austere sensation 
yet perplexed with desolate vexation, 
contemplating my prospects with her
if I'm not transgender. 

Thoughts of afterlife can cause
a person to become reflective.
As soon as you’re beyond the jaws
of death they’ll show a retrospective, 
exhibiting your every deed, 
redacted by your friends, directed
by enemies who pay no heed
to glory that you once reflected.

The audience and critics will
be spouse and family, who’ll force
the world to watch the show until
the painful exhibition ends.
If they believe you were a hit––
unlikely in my circumstance–– 
and showed some glimmer in your wit, 
no lady who is fat will dance
or sing to warn you that the show
has ended, but you’ll need no warning, 
since you’ll be dead, and will not know
that no one truly is in mourning, 
for nothing is expungible
from your life history once you
have died, and you so fungible, 
your death is nothing that they’ll rue.

The show will never be repeated, 
once the barrier’s been crossed, 
for death will never be defeated––
and after it comes permafrost, 
not Purgatory or Hell as some
have claimed, there won’t be fires
awaiting us, not doomed to come
to judgment, sentenced for our priors.


ou say you love me, 
Yet you are still with her, 
I watch as your relationship continues, 
And I am just not sure. 
Don't know if you meant what you said, 
If I can wait for you any longer, 
We are growing apart, 
I am not getting any stronger. 
I need you by my side, 
To keep me strong when I am down, 
I listen to you, 
But I don't hear a sound. 
The glisten in your eyes says you are a good guy, 
I know its true thats why I love you, 
Sometimes I am a bit shy, 
And you know why. 
I want you back in my life, 
I want to live as your wife. 
You owe it to me, 
To be honest and true, 
No cheating or lieing, 
Only me and you. 
Its so hard to see myself without you, 
I just wouldn't know what to do, 
You are standing at a crossroad, 
and you have a choice to make. 
Its time to hear the truth, 
And tell her for her sake. 

Who am I? 
Am I the man with a briefcase in one hand and a mobile in the other rushing through the street? 

Or

Will I be still standing after the crushing blows that life at my soul throws? 

What makes me so different from everyone else? 
Am I not human? 

Will I not sin if tempted? 

Will I not take revenge if wronged? 

Will I become another cog in this concrete machine? 

But is there still hope! ? 
For the true heart of Dublin is not the clanking of this dead materialistic metallic machine but the beating of this natural oasis.
The only constant in this ever changing city.
Time will tell if I have the strength and virility of nature to face the changes of these infertile, artificial landscapes.
Will my convictions stand the testament of time or suffer under the pressure of this compassionate-less world of mine. 

A R I S E, my soul, on wings enraptur'd, rise
To praise the monarch of the earth and skies,
Whose goodness and benificence appear
As round its centre moves the rolling year,
Or when the morning glows with rosy charms,
Or the sun slumbers in the ocean's arms:
Of light divine be a rich portion lent
To guide my soul, and favour my intend.
Celestial muse, my arduous flight sustain
And raise my mind to a seraphic strain!
Which round the sun revolves this vast machine,
Though to his eye its mass a point appears:
Which first ordain'd that mighty Sol should reign
The peerless monarch of th' ethereal train:
Of miles twice forty millions is his height,
And yet his radiance dazzles mortal sight
So far beneath--from him th' extended earth
Vigour derives, and ev'ry flow'ry birth:
Vast through her orb she moves with easy grace
Around her Phoebus in unbounded space;
True to her course th' impetuous storm derides,
Triumphant o'er the winds, and surging tides.
  Almighty, in these wond'rous works of thine,
What Pow'r, what Wisdom, and what Goodness shine!
And yet creating glory unador'd!
  Creation smiles in various beauty gay,
While day to night, and night succeeds to day:
Shines most conspicuous in the solar rays:
Without them, destitute of heat and light,
This world would be the reign of endless night:
In their excess how would our race complain,
Abhorring life! how hate its length'ned chain!
From air adust what num'rous ills would rise?
What dire contagion taint the burning skies?
What pestilential vapours, fraught with death,
Would rise, and overspread the lands beneath?
  Hail, smiling morn, that from the orient main
Ascending dost adorn the heav'nly plain!
So rich, so various are thy beauteous dies,
That spread through all the circuit of the skies,
That, full of thee, my soul in rapture soars,
  O'er beings infinite his love extends,
His Wisdom rules them, and his Pow'r defends.
When tasks diurnal tire the human frame,
The spirits faint, and dim the vital flame,
Then too that ever active bounty shines,
Which not infinity of space confines.
The sable veil, that Night in silence draws,
Conceals effects, but shows th' Almighty Cause,
Night seals in sleep the wide creation fair,
And all is peaceful but the brow of care.
Again, gay Phoebus, as the day before,
Wakes ev'ry eye, but what shall wake no more;
Again the face of nature is renew'd,
Which still appears harmonious, fair, and good.
May grateful strains salute the smiling morn,
Before its beams the eastern hills adorn!
  Shall day to day, and night to night conspire
To show the goodness of the Almighty Sire?
This mental voice shall man regardless hear,
And never, never raise the filial pray'r?
To-day, O hearken, nor your folly mourn
For time mispent, that never will return.
     But see the sons of vegetation rise,
And spread their leafy banners to the skies.
All-wise Almighty Providence we trace
In trees, and plants, and all the flow'ry race;
As clear as in the nobler frame of man,
All lovely copies of the Maker's plan.
The pow'r the same that forms a ray of light,
That call d creation from eternal night.
"Let there be light," he said: from his profound
Old Chaos heard, and trembled at the sound:
Swift as the word, inspir'd by pow'r divine,
Behold the light around its Maker shine,
And now through all his works diffus'd abroad.
So we may trace him in the night's repose:
Say what is sleep? and dreams how passing strange!
When action ceases, and ideas range
Licentious and unbounded o'er the plains,
Hear in soft strains the dreaming lover sigh
To a kind fair, or rave in jealousy;
On pleasure now, and now on vengeance bent,
The lab'ring passions struggle for a vent.
What pow'r, O man! thy reason then restores,
So long suspended in nocturnal hours?
What secret hand returns the mental train,
And gives improv'd thine active pow'rs again?
From thee, O man, what gratitude should rise!
And, when from balmy sleep thou op'st thine eyes,
Let thy first thoughts be praises to the skies.
O'erflowing tides of joy to human hearts,
When wants and woes might be our righteous lot,
  Among the mental pow'rs a question rose,
"What most the image of th' Eternal shows?"
When thus to Reason (so let Fancy rove)
Her great companion spoke immortal Love.
  "Say, mighty pow'r, how long shall strife prevail,
"And with its murmurs load the whisp'ring gale?
"Refer the cause to Recollection's shrine,
"Who loud proclaims my origin divine,
"The cause whence heav'n and earth began to be,
"And is not man immortaliz'd by me?
"Reason let this most causeless strife subside

"
Thus Love pronounc'd, and Reason thus reply'd.
"Thy words persuade, my soul enraptur'd feels
"Resistless beauty which thy smile reveals

"
Ardent she spoke, and, kindling at her charms,
She clasp'd the blooming goddess in her arms.
  Infinite Love where'er we turn our eyes
Appears: this ev'ry creature's wants supplies;
This most is heard in Nature's constant voice,
This makes the morn, and this the eve rejoice;
This bids the fost'ring rains and dews descend
To nourish all, to serve one gen'ral end,
The good of man: yet man ungrateful pays
But little homage, and but little praise.
To him, whose works arry'd with mercy shine,
What songs should rise, how constant, how divine

or even 'many happy returns of the day'.
My folks send me gifts and greeting
congratulating me
on a life that's fleeting? 
A birthday complete with cakes in the color of my choice
Granted that birthdays are a celebration for to rejoice
Yet I can act pessimistic on this
To see the hour-glass of life half empty
rather than half full.
For I can vision each birthday
as a step closer to old age
A step closer to dreaded death
It's hard to look forward to going gaga or decrepit
when smooth skin would become crumpled, wrinkled
The age of doddering limbs half in the grave
Thus in one aspect each birthday to me
is a step closer to the end of a lifetime
A step closer to the unwanted guest - senility
That reverting to child-like debility
The dwindling of all agility
So I've mixed feelings about celebrating
the nearing of the time when
we'd play back 'em' flash-backs
and in the mind re-live our life tracks
when everything would trickle down to mere memories
with ample time to linger upon life's souvenirs
When we would merely walk down memory lane

So to see it this way
A birthday is a step forward
but towards thy graveyard
The road might be longer
or unfortunately
end abruptly
in a short cut
to heaven or to hell
bard or no bard! 

Yet despite knowing all this, I'm always happy come my birthdays
Contented and spirited, flying around chattering like pretty jays

Thousand times I asked my Guru, 
What's HIS name, who's called Nothing? 
Asking him again and again, 
I was tired and exhausted. 
But all too subtly 
Something came out of nothing 
After all


Heartworn happiness, fine line that winds   
among the tapestry’s old blacks and blues,   
bright hair blazing in the theater,
red hair raving in the bar—as now
the little leaves shoot veils of gold
across the trees’ bones, shroud of spring,   
ghost of summer, shadblow snow, blood-
russet spoor spilled prodigal on last year’s leaves . . .   
When your yellows, greens, and yellow-greens,   
your ochres and your umbers have evolved   
nearly to hemlock blackness, cypress blackness,   
when the woods are rife with soddenness   
(unfolded ferns, skunk cabbage by the stream,   
barberry by the trunks, and bitter
watercress inside the druid pool)
will your thin, still-glinting thread insist   
to catch the eye in filigreed titrations
stitched along among beneath the branches,   
in the branches where it lives all winter,   
occulted fire, brief constant fleeting gold . . . 

Three blind mice, three blind mice, 
See how they run! 
They all run after the farmer's wife, 
And she cut off their tails with a carving knife, 
Did ever you see such a thing in your life 
As three blind mice

This Full Moon night I bear witness to
The magic that surrounds me
In Loving Light
Standing before the First Cross
Letting soul whispers carried forth
Along the gentle breeze
Not to distant for all to see
The Second Cross called to me
Knowing there be a Third
I did not have to travel far
Set in formation the Grand Cross
Was always there above
Found Three Crosses
Wrapt in the golden aura of a sun-kissed moon
Emanating slivers of silver moonbeams
True beauty of the Divine
I bear witness to this Full Moon night


Three curs'ed nails
 
It only took three curs'ed nails, by the hands of evil man.
It only took three curs'ed nails to hang Him to ‘the tree; 
It only took three curs'ed nails, thrust through this godly Man; 
It only took three curs'ed nails and He died to set me free; 
It only took three curs'ed nails to prove His love Devine; '
It only took three curs'ed nails to give me ‘eyes to see’
It only took three curs'ed nails to change this heart of mine; 

I'm award, soul has gone through many stress, Pains.
Take courage, stay strong, your mind in wisdom train.
Viewing with shrewd mind, the heart always retain.
Proper view, delights the mind, heart sorrow refrained.

Have a soul ever wonder, why beautiful birds sing? 
why  birds permeate the air or swing beautiful wings? 
A soul that behold conclude; birds 're  part of our world, 

All soul have, in their life three, but important days.
When cognizant of it colored, the mind get a better rays.
But, it's not always easy to find, or yield a better way.
When a good fight is fought, a soul always pleasure lay.

Whenever, our yesterday is mess up and pointless, 
We use today to repair, strengthens yesterday stress.
whenever, we don’t know what tomorrow  actually wage, 
We use today in every way to prepare for tomorrow gage.

Has been a perfect day
The love of friends foretold
By a rainbow’s arc 
Seen yesterday.
Tomorrow’s
An unwritten page
Line by line it will appear
In faith
Good Friday


Flakes to the left and flakes to the right, 
As I was stomping home through the blur
All wrapped in my cloak with a collar of fur, 
The staff in my fist and mittens of wool, 
And looking a bit like an old backwoods fool; 
My face was all warm with a long beard of white -
I must have presented a curious sight! 
Hark! There! Behind me, a pitter, a patter
Of many small feet - what might be the matter? ! 
Like ducklings they gather, like chicken they scatter
Like owlets they whisper, like sparrows they chatter! 
I turn and I see, they are fighting the snow, 
Seven shivering elves, their noses aglow.
They fidget and fret and tug at my laces
And look up at me with sad little faces. The smallest one lisps and he hems and he haws: 
'Pray, say, sir! Are you - maybe? - Santa Claus? '
I lied just a little and took them straight down
To the very best baker in the center of town.
And when we were standing outside of the store
Our hands full with candy and cookies and more, 
The smallest elf said with a smile on his lips: 
'Tomorrow, we promise, we'll be back at six! '

(after the original German: Drei Tage vor Weihnachten, by Adolf Ey)When saw I yesterday walking apart
In a leafy place where the cattle wait?
Something to keep for a charm in my heart-
A little sweet girl in a garden gate.
Laughing she lay in the gold sun's might,
And held for a target to shelter her,
In her little soft fingers, round and white,
The gold-rimmed face of a sunflower.

Laughing she lay on the stone that stands
For a rough-hewn step in that sunny place,
And her yellow hair hung down to her hands,
Shadowing over her dimpled face.
Her eyes like the blue of the sky, made dim
With the might of the sun that looked at her,
Shone laughing over the serried rim,
Golden set, of the sunflower.

Laughing, for token she gave to me
Three petals out of the sunflower;-
When the petals are withered and gone, shall be
Three verses of mine for praise of her,
That a tender dream of her face may rise
And lighten me yet in another hour,
Of her sunny hair and her beautiful eyes,
Laughing over the golden sunflower. 

One knock
just say my name

Two knocks
you should clear your ears

Three knocks
open the door

REMEMBER all those renowned generations,
They left their bodies to fatten the wolves,
They left their homesteads to fatten the foxes,
Fled to far countries, or sheltered themselves
In cavern, crevice, or hole,
Defending Ireland's soul.
Be still, be still, what can be said?
My father sang that song,
But time amends old wrong,
All that is finished, let it fade.
Remember all those renowned generations,
Remember all that have sunk in their blood,
Remember all that have died on the scaffold,
Remember all that have fled, that have stood,
Stood, took death like a tune
On an old,tambourine.
Be still, be still, what can be said?
My father sang that song,
But time amends old wrong,
And all that's finished, let it fade.
Fail, and that history turns into rubbish,
All that great past to a trouble of fools;
Those that come after shall mock at O'Donnell,
Mock at the memory of both O'Neills,
Mock Emmet, mock Parnell,
All the renown that fell.
Be still, be still, what can be said?
My father sang that song,
but time amends old wrong,
And all that's finished, let it fade.
The soldier takes pride in saluting his Captain,
Some back a mare thrown from a thoroughbred,,
Troy backed its Helen; Troy died and adored;
Great nations blossom above;
A slave bows down to a slave.
What marches through the mountain pass?
No, no, my son, not yet;
That is an airy spot,
And no man knows what treads the grass.
We know what rascal might has defiled,
The lofty innocence that it has slain,
Were we not born in the peasant's cot
Where men forgive if the belly gain?
More dread the life that we live,
How can the mind forgive?
What marches down the mountain pass?
No, no, my son, not yet;
That is an airy spot,
And no man knows what treads the grass.
What if there's nothing up there at the top?
Where are the captains that govern mankind?
What tears down a tree that has nothing within it?
A blast of the wind, O a marching wind,
March wind, and any old tune.
March, march, and how does it run?
What marches down the mountain pass?
No, no, my son, not yet;
That is an airy spot,
And no man knows what treads the grass.

III
Grandfather sang it under the gallows:
'Hear, gentlemen, ladies, and all mankind:
Money is good and a girl might be better,
But good strong blows are delights to the mind.'
There, standing on the cart,
He sang it from his heart.
But he took down the moon
And rattled out a tunc;
Robbers had taken his old tambourinc.>'A girl I had, but she followed another,
Money I had, and it went in the night,
Strong drink I had, and it brought me to sorrow,
But a good strong cause and blows are delight.'
All there caught up the tune:
'Oh, on, my darling man.'

Robbers had taken his old tambourine,
But he took down the moon
And rattled out a tune;>Robbers had taken his old tambourine.
'Money is good and a girl might be better,
No matter what happens and who takes the fall,
But a good strong cause' -- the rope gave a jerk there,
No more sang he, for his throat was too small;
But he kicked before he died,
He did it out of pride.
But he took down the moon
And rattled out a tune;
Robbers had taken his old tambourine. 

This day three months ago
Was the last day I ever saw you
It's been the most beautiful day
Of the many I already knew

Three is a magical number
The moon is now fully gone
I pray to see you on day number four
While remembering the things we have done

Please don't throw this chance away
Join me in the highest of jumps
My greatest wish is for you to stay
And I'd wait forever for this day to come


SHAKESPEAREAN fish swam the sea, far away from land;
Romantic fish swam in nets coming to the hand;
What are all those fish that lie gasping on the strand

At three in the morning I used to be sleeping an untroubled
sleep in my bed.
But lately at three in the morning I'm tossing and turning,
Awakened by hypochondria, and gas, and nameless dread,
Whose name I've been learning. (worry) 

At three in the morning I brood about what my cholesterol
count might reveal,
And the pains in my chest start progressing from gentle to racking,
While certain intestinal problems make clear that the onions
I ate with my meal
Plan on counter attacking. 

At three in the morning I look toward the future with blankets
pulled over my ears,
And all of my basic equipment is distinctly diminished.
My gums are receding, my blood pressure's high, and I can't
begin listing my fears
Or I'll never get finished.
At three in the morning I used to be sleeping but lately I wake 
and reflect 

That my girlhood has gone and I'll now have to manage without it.
They tell me that I'm heading into my prime. From the previews
I do not expect
To be crazy about it. 

When I pronounce the word Future,
the first syllable already belongs to the past.

When I pronounce the word Silence,
I destroy it.

When I pronounce the word Nothing,
I make something no nonbeing can hold. 

first time my father overheard me listening to
this bit of music he asked me,
"what is it?"
"it's called Love For Three Oranges,"
I informed him.
"boy," he said, "that's getting it
cheap

"
he meant sex.
listening to it
I always imagined three oranges
sitting there,
you know how orange they can
get,
so mightily orange.
maybe Prokofiev had meant
what my father
thought.
if so, I preferred it the
other way
the most horrible thing
I could think of
was part of me being
what ejaculated out of the
end of his
stupid penis.
I will never forgive him
for that,
his trick that I am stuck
with,
I find no nobility in
parenthood.
I say kill the Father
before he makes more
such as
I. 

I, you, he, she, it-
three distinct views of the world
(though perhaps not to the Creator?)  
which seem so different. Which
grammarians note, and writers write about.

A father who was all mine, I thought, 
waiting for a boy one day after school
who was that younger me
with a small and lively bundle of love and energy and loyalty
straining to meet this stranger, as if I’d been a friend
already all its life - yet whom he’d not yet met -
straining at a brand-new brown leather leash-
how well you remember it-

he said he’d bought it for that son, who was me
but when, a childhood ago, he had to have it put away
it was he who cried for, so mother said
only the second time in his life.
I just felt betrayed. Again.

so when they gathered at his, that’s father’s, funeral
thinking of things to say
that would not hurt too much to say
they said, and he loved that dog so much he cried, 
for the second time in his life, Dorothy says, 
we never ever saw him cry-

and you remember that day and what they said
so clearly

and though I’ve moved from there
they may if they remember me
say much the same of other matters about that boy
who was me. For

memory doesn’t distinguish much in the past
between the living and the dead, in grammar, 
why should it

and you wonder, well I do, 
whether Sport in his unspoken dog-grammar
even with his eloquent tail
perhaps, sniffing at an interesting tree in the park
might not distinguish just as sharply with that wet, wise nose, 
I-dog, you-dog, he, she, it-dog, 

living with memory of some unspoken kind, yet
oblivious of death 
or betrayal.



for Max if he likes it


First starts with lateness
And then you begin to lie
Then you forget me


First daughter makes she say
Second daughter goes far away
Third daughter takes another day


LOVE, thou art best of Human Joys, 
 Our chiefest Happiness below;
All other Pleasures are but Toys,
Musick without Thee is but Noise, 
 And Beauty but an empty Show. 
Heav'n, who knew best what Man wou'd move, 
 And raise his Thoughts above the Brute;
Said, Let him Be, and let him Love;
That must alone his Soul improve, 
 Howe'er Philosophers dispute. 


II

Quickly, Delia, Learn my Passion,
 Lose not Pleasure, to be Proud;
Courtship draws on Observation,
 And the Whispers of the Croud. 

Soon or late you'll hear a Lover, 
 Nor by Time his Truth can prove;
Ages won't a Heart discover, 
 Trust, and so secure my Love

III

'TIS strange, this Heart within my breast, 
 Reason opposing, and her Pow'rs,
Cannot one gentle Moment rest,
 Unless it knows what's done in Yours. 
In vain I ask it of your Eyes, 
 Which subt'ly would my Fears controul;
For Art has taught them to disguise,
 Which Nature made t' explain the Soul. 

In vain that Sound, your Voice affords, 
 Flatters sometimes my easy Mind;
But of too vast Extent are Words
 In them the Jewel Truth to find. 

Then let my fond Enquiries cease, 
 And so let all my Troubles end:
For, sure, that Heart shall ne'er know Peace, 
 Which on Anothers do's depend. 

A second crop of hay lies cut 
and turned. Five gleaming crows 
search and peck between the rows. 
They make a low, companionable squawk, 
and like midwives and undertakers 
possess a weird authority. 


Crickets leap from the stubble, 
parting before me like the Red Sea. 
The garden sprawls and spoils. 


Across the lake the campers have learned 
to water ski. They have, or they haven’t. 
Sounds of the instructor’s megaphone 
suffuse the hazy air. "Relax! Relax!" 


Cloud shadows rush over drying hay, 
fences, dusty lane, and railroad ravine. 
The first yellowing fronds of goldenrod 
brighten the margins of the woods. 


Schoolbooks, carpools, pleated skirts; 
water, silver-still, and a vee of geese. 


* 


The cicada’s dry monotony breaks 
over me. The days are bright 
and free, bright and free. 


Then why did I cry today 
for an hour, with my whole 
body, the way babies cry? 


* 


A white, indifferent morning sky, 
and a crow, hectoring from its nest 
high in the hemlock, a nest as big 
as a laundry basket

In my childhood 
I stood under a dripping oak, 
while autumnal fog eddied around my feet, 
waiting for the school bus 
with a dread that took my breath away. 


The damp dirt road gave off 
this same complex organic scent. 


I had the new books—words, numbers, 
and operations with numbers I did not 
comprehend—and crayons, unspoiled 
by use, in a blue canvas satchel 
with red leather straps. 


Spruce, inadequate, and alien 
I stood at the side of the road. 
It was the only life I had. 

THE Roaring Tinker if you like,
But Mannion is my name,
And I beat up the common sort
And think it is no shame.
The common breeds the common,
A lout begets a lout,
So when I take on half a score
I knock their heads about.
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.

All Mannions come from Manannan,
Though rich on every shore
He never lay behind four walls
He had such character,
Nor ever made an iron red
Nor soldered pot or pan;
His roaring and his ranting
Best please a wandering man.
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.

Could Crazy Jane put off old age
And ranting time renew,
Could that old god rise up again
We'd drink a can or two,
And out and lay our leadership
On country and on town,
Throw likely couples into bed
And knock the others down.
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.

II
My name is Henry Middleton,
I have a small demesne,
A small forgotten house that's set
On a storm-bitten green.
I scrub its floors and make my bed,
I cook and change my plate,
The post and garden-boy alone
Have keys to my old gate.
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.

Though I have locked my gate on them,
I pity all the young,
I know what devil's trade they learn
From those they live among,
Their drink, their pitch-and-toss by day,
Their robbery by night;
The wisdom of the people's gone,
How can the young go straight?
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.

When every Sunday afternoon
On the Green Lands I walk
And wear a coat in fashion.
Memories of the talk
Of henwives and of queer old men
Brace me and make me strong;
There's not a pilot on the perch
Knows I have lived so long.
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.

III
Come gather round me, players all:
Come praise Nineteen-Sixteen,
Those from the pit and gallery
Or from the painted scene
That fought in the Post Office
Or round the City Hall,
praise every man that came again,
Praise every man that fell.
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.

Who was the first man shot that day?
The player Connolly,
Close to the City Hall he died;
Catriage and voice had he;
He lacked those years that go with skill,
But later might have been
A famous, a brilliant figure
Before the painted scene.
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen.

Some had no thought of victory
But had gone out to die
That Ireland's mind be greater,
Her heart mount up on high;
And yet who knows what's yet to come?
For patrick pearse had said
That in every generation
Must Ireland's blood be shed.
From mountain to mountain ride the fierce horsemen. 

A Leprechaun sits 
underneath a tree
Playing his golden
flute like many
Leprechauns like to
do.

Leprechaun says he
will grant you three
wishes, 
It is St. Patrick's
Day now, 
This is his time to 
share his luck.

Always be careful
what you wish for, 
A bad wish could
come back to torment
you night and day.

After your wishes have
been granted, 
You are told to be on
your way.

Leprechaun disappears
like a mist of fog, 
The music of the flute
slowly fades like a
whisper, 
Then, you hear the 
silence.

Next St. Patrick's Day
the Leprechaun will 
return, 
For anyone that happens
to see him sitting 
underneath a tree, 
playing his golden flute. 

History
Do you know how the squirrel got its three stripes? 
The lord was pleased and drew three stripes on its back


Present
To date the squirrel carries those stripes
The sergeant stripes of the lord
The proof that they helped build the bridge to Lanka

Future

Is this going to be the only proof that the bridge was built? 
Since, the setu is going to be demolished.
Or will they also lose the stripe that was given by the lord? 

What needs to be done? 

Let us hold a convention of the squirrels in Dhanush Koti
To prove to the world that the bridge was built 
Let us recreate history by getting the original builders to the core.`O cruel Death, give three things back,'
Sang a bone upon the shore;
`A child found all a child can lack,
Whether of pleasure or of rest,
Upon the abundance of my breast':
A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.

`Three dear things that women know,'
Sang a bhone upon the shore;
`A man if I but held him so
When my body was alive
Found all the pleasure that life gave':
A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.

`The third thing that I think of yet,'
Sang a bone upon the shore,
`Is that morning when I met
Face to face my rightful man
And did after stretch and yawn':
A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind. 

A Robin Redbreast in a cage,
Puts all Heaven in a rage. 

A skylark wounded on the wing
Doth make a cherub cease to sing. 

He who shall hurt the little wren
Shall never be beloved by men. 

With a jar of wine I sit by the flowering trees.
I drink alone, and where are my friends?
Ah, the moon above looks down on me;
I call and lift my cup to his brightness.
And see, there goes my shadow before me.
Ho! We're a party of three, I say,—
Though the poor moon can't drink,
And my shadow but dances around me,
We're all friends to-night,
The drinker, the moon and the shadow.
Let our revelry be meet for the spring time!

I sing, the wild moon wanders the sky.
I dance, my shadow goes tumbling about.
While we're awake, let us join in carousal;
Only sweet drunkenness shall ever part us.
Let us pledge a friendship no mortals know,
And often hail each other at evening
Far across the vast and vaporous space

Darling  you and me
as we sit, 
in the cold November
wind, 
snow flakes falling, 
magic
me, I shiver and shake
you
wrap your warm embrace.
eyes
full of intense emotions
gazing, 
letting your heat course
through
your heart and finger tips
on to
my waiting parted lips, 
you bite
my skin, I fire up
darling
you, me and the cold
having
a threesome in the
crisp
November night


Thrice toss these oaken ashes in the air,
     Thrice sit thou mute in this enchanted chair,
     Then thrice three times tie up this true love's knot,
     And murmur soft 'She will, or she will not.'

       Go burn these pois'nous weeds in yon blue fire,
     These screech-owl's feathers and this prickling briar,
     This cypress gathered at a dead man's grave,
     That all my fears and cares an end may have.

       Then come, you fairies! dance with me a round;
   Melt her hard heart with your melodious sound.
   In vain are all the charms I can devise:
   She hath an art to break them with her eyes. 

Soft summer zephyr wafts Keats' Nightingale
along time's rhyme line, on no midnight sleeps, 
Tree Dryad's tune sends tremors up, down dale, 
harmonics' sweet eternal wonder keeps.
'Sull'aria', soft canzonetta's call, 
runs through the gamut of emotions' range, 
as 'soave zefiretto' trembles, held in thrall
as siren song on perilous seas full strange.
Through woven word worlds lovers from the past
still celebrate angelic serenade, 
whose haunting chords undaunted by time's blast
ignore farewells despite life's cavalcade.
Each note outreaches generation gaps
as thrilling throat trills dream theme which won't lapse.

(May What we, when face to face we see 
The Father of our souls, shall be, 
John tells us, doth not yet appear; 
Ah! did he tell what we are here!

A mind for thoughts to pass into, 
A heart for loves to travel through, 
Five senses to detect things near, 
Is this the whole that we are here?

Rules baffle instincts--instinct rules, 
Wise men are bad--and good are fools, 
Facts evil--wishes vain appear, 
We cannot go, why are we here?

O may we for assurance's sake, 
Some arbitrary judgement take, 
And wilfully pronounce it clear, 
For this or that 'tis we are here?

Or is it right, and will it do, 
To pace the sad confusion through, 
And say:--It doth not yet appear, 
What we shall be, what we are here?

Ah yet, when all is thought and said, 
The heart still overrules the head; 
Still what we hope we must believe, 
And what is given us receive;

Must still believe, for still we hope 
That in a world of larger scope, 
What here is faithfully begun 
Will be completed, not undone.

My child, we still must think, when we 
That ampler life together see, 
Some true result will yet appear 
Of what we are, together, here. 

Through an Adult's eyes, Life's a game.
The news, the prose, they're one and the same.
A war claims lives, 
People Die.
Its only a fight through an Adult's eyes.

Through an Adult's eyes, work is all.
The Jobs, the paperwork, each day is a wall.
Computers and books.
Little difference to us.
There reality checks.

Through an Adult's eyes, we will eventually die.
Apathy, and old age, their road invades.
A neverending path, 
We can't run away.
All there is, is work and play.

Through an Adult's eyes, fall has arrived.
The sunlight, the moon, the fresh morning dew.
Each day brings, no surprise.
Each day is the same through, 
This Adult's Eyes. 

I 

All night, through the eternity of night, 
Pain was my potion though I could not feel. 
Deep in my humbled heart you ground your heel, 
Till I was reft of even my inner light, 
Till reason from my mind had taken flight, 
And all my world went whirling in a reel. 
And all my swarthy strength turned cold like steel, 
A passive mass beneath your puny might. 
Last night I gave you triumph over me, 
So I should be myself as once before, 
I marveled at your shallow mystery, 
And haunted hungrily your temple door. 
I gave you sum and substance to be free, 
Oh, you shall never triumph any more! 


II 

I do not fear to face the fact and say, 
How darkly-dull my living hours have grown, 
My wounded heart sinks heavier than stone, 
Because I loved you longer than a day! 
I do not shame to turn myself away 
From beckoning flowers beautifully blown, 
To mourn your vivid memory alone 
In mountain fastnesses austerely gray. 
The mists will shroud me on the utter height, 
The salty, brimming waters of my breast 
Will mingle with the fresh dews of the night 
To bathe my spirit hankering to rest. 
But after sleep I'll wake with greater might, 
Once more to venture on the eternal quest. 

I'm going to tell you a story about a very strong woman
She took lies and abuse from her violent, drunk husband

He controlled her every emotion and made her very wary
She constantly tred on egg-shells, this was more than scary

She was always to blame; he says she drove him to it
She couldn't help but believe him, maybe thats why she got hit

He covered her with bruises; which were sometimes easily noticed
She knew herself what they were but told her friends to take no notice

He always started the arguments and then they would begin to fight
At the end he'd walk out, only to be expected back later that night

Anxiously she would wait for him, knowing what was going to happen
She would feel sick to her stomach, she knew she would get a bashing

Suddenly she would hear the door slam and run for a place to hide
She knew he would be looking for her, she couldn't help but break down and cry

Her children were terrified of him; they regularly saw what he would do
He would say that she was crazy; they knew he wasn't telling the truth

She tried her hardest to protect them, even if it put her in danger
They were always on her side, to them he was nothing but a stranger

Was this going to be her life? Did she not deserve any happiness? 
She began to lose faith and hope, believing the answer was yes

Well let me tell you something now, her new life has just begun
She's still going through the pain but this brave woman is infact my mum


Through pleasant paths, through dainty ways, 
   Love leads my feet; 
Where beauty shines with living rays, 
   Soft, gentle, sweet; 
The placid heart at random strays, 
And sings, and smiles, and laughs and plays, 
And gathers from the summer days 
   Their light and heat, 
That in its chambers burn and blaze 
   And beam and beat. 

I throw myself among the ferns 
   Under the shade, 
And watch the summer sun that burns 
   On dell and glade; 
To thee, my dear, my fancy turns, 
In thee its Paradise discerns, 
For thee it sighs, for thee it yearns, 
   My chosen maid; 
And that still depth of passion learns 
   Which cannot fade. 

The wind that whispers in the night, 
   Subtle and free, 
The gorgeous noonday's blinding light, 
   On hill and tree, 
All lovely things that meet my sight, 
All shifting lovelinesses bright, 
Speak to my heart with calm delight, 
   Seeming to be 
Cloth'd with enchantment, robed in white, 
   To sing of thee. 

The ways of life are hard and cold 
   To one alone; 
Bitter the strife for place and gold -- 
   We weep and groan: 
But when love warms the heart grows bold; 
And when our arms the prize enfold, 
Dearest! the heart can hardly hold 
   The bliss unknown, 
Unspoken, never to be told -- 
   My own, my own

A stream flowing through the old oak tree is still alive.
The heart of the forest (wood which has lived to long it is, unexpected obstacle, this living log 
and complicated cover which I lowered)   
of rich redwood of old green growth 
the menagerie where these forests are in English it is simple.

Once of the lower order I climb up to be exchanged.
Decrease slippery many salamanders for example, 
going in and out of the mouth of holes in the clay.

Fighting it depends on the rough ligneous wreckage. 
Many kinds are compared to the forest 
where the plantation and other young person maintain 
social structural their heritage and are managed, 
at least temporarily.
It is expected some watching while a few others
all over one maintains their feelings, facial composure. 

Being natural, the dependence of many more of the same
but different shapes to the feature of the old forest.
Some salamanders are short thick headed and round.
It lived and died inside, the wooden cavity of the oak.
Others with heads to huge were lowered deeper inside.
Before, perhaps, it's empty when full catching breath because
of the heritage which remains there it is there rooted mainly. 

Through the trees inside the darkness
Of the tender arms of night
A glowing fire gently burnished
His skin before the firelight.
He swigged a drink without much notice 
As if readying for a fight
Then speaking straight like a good witness
Speakin' what he knew was right-

He said 
Only cowards search tomorrow
For a way to hurt someone
Warriors who are friends of sorrow 
Don't wish it on anyone
If you gonna beg or steal or borrow
Have a star to wish upon
None too big for their own shadow
Or their worn out mocassins.

For both the eagle and the sparrow
Know their place under the sun
But sittin' all day sharpenin' arrows
Nothing but another way to run.
In the bone down in the marrow
Where the sweetest sign will come
A taker's road is long and harrowed 
A giver's job ain't never done. 

From the walls of Baidi high in the coloured dawn 
To Jiangling by night-fall is three hundred miles, 
Yet monkeys are still calling on both banks behind me 
To my boat these ten thousand mountains away. 

Through these pale cold days
What dark faces burn
Out of three thousand years,
And their wild eyes yearn,

While underneath their brows
Like waifs their spirits grope
For the pools of Hebron again--
For Lebanon's summer slope.

They leave these blond still days
In dust behind their tread
They see with living eyes
How long they have been dead.(Just a tiny view. )    

Cannot know my agony
For there are wounds
That are never communicable
And, your recurrent beam
Betrays a heart
Unremorseful enough
In self rapt, rather irrevocable

Cannot know my anguish
For torture like this
Remains rather immutable
While, your insistent prop
For those who allow this crime
Reveals a mind
Ill-advised, vastly despicable

What slays conscience
Insidiously
Impartibly assassinates 
Sensibility
And, the sacrosanct soul
Ravenously. 

Only earnest consenters
Merit solemn claim 
To closest lineage
Earn unabating, 
Devoted thought

Slaying pre-born child
To deviously wild
Callously beguiled 
Monstrously devised plot
Is condemned souls' fraud! 

'Abortion is the greatest threat to the future security of mankind' 
                  - Blessed Mother Teresa -I see through you, and through you
My future still seems so blurry
I see through you, and through you
I still feel you, flowing through my veins 
I see through you, and through you
My future keeps turning out so dim
I need you, to guide me into the light 
I’ll feed you, with my dreams that haunt me in the night 
One day I’ll see you, I’ll feel you, one day you’ll be apart of me
But for now I can’t see my future that still seems so blurry


Throw out your watch, throw away.   
Start  feeding a sparrow on a palm
Go for  sleeping  closely  fireplace 
Do not let the  knocks  frighten to you  
Sometimes  a dog  scratch at the  door
He  likes walks during  moonlight too
Please, do not torment itself in vain 
Who should come will come, unlocks 
Believe to me - who which you wait 
Likes to come in without knocks. 
Likes to come in without blocks. 
 Poor old man,  throw out watch,  throw  
For feeding   time-bird  through the window.

The house near the sea

The houses I had they took away from me. The times
happened to be unpropitious: war, destruction, exile; 
sometimes the hunter hits the migratory birds, 
sometimes he doesn't hit them. Hunting
was good in my time, many felt the pellet; 
the rest circle aimlessly or go mad in the shelters.

Don't talk to me about the nightingale or the lark
or the little wagtail
inscribing figures with his tail in the light; 
I don't know much about houses
I know they have their own nature, nothing else.
New at first, like babies
who play in gardens with the tassels of the sun.
they embroider colored shutters and shining doors
over the day.
When the architect's finished, they change, 
they frown or smile or even grow stubborn
with those who stayed behind, with those who went away
with others who'd come back if they could
or others who disappeared, now that the world's become
an endless hotel.

I don't know much about houses, 
I remember their joy and their sorrow
sometimes, when I stop to think; 
again
sometimes, near the sea, in naked rooms
with a single iron bed and nothing of my own, 
watching the evening spider, I imagine
that someone is getting ready to come, that they dress
him up*
in white and black robes, with many-colored jewels, 
and around him venerable ladies, 
gray hair and dark lace shawls, talk softly, 
that he is getting ready to come and say goodbye to me; 
or that a woman—eyelashes quivering, slim-waisted, 
returning from southern ports, 
Smyrna Phodes Syracuse Alexandria, 
from cities closed like hot shutters, 
with perfume of golden fruit and herbs—
climbs the stairs without seeing
those who've fallen asleep under the stairs.

Houses, you know, grow stubborn easily when you strip
them bare.

Sensual Elpenor

I saw him yesterday standing by the door
below my window; it was about
seven o'clock; there was a woman with him.
He had the look of Elpenor just before he fell
and smashed himself, yet he wasn't drunk.
He was speaking fast, and she
was gazing absently toward the gramophones; 
now and then she cut him short to say a word
and then would glance impatiently
toward where they were frying fish: like a cat.
He muttered with a cigarette butt between his lips: 
—'Listen. There's this too. In the moonlight
the status sometimes bend like reeds
in the midst of ripe fruit—the statues; 
and the flame becomes a cool oleander, 
the flame that burns you, I mean.'

—'It's just the light- shadows of the night.'

—'Maybe the night that split open, a blue pomegranate, 
a dark breast, and filled you with stars, 
cleaving time.
And yet the statues
bend sometimes, dividing desire in two, 
like a peach; and the flame
becomes a kiss on the limbs, a sobbing, 
and then a cool leaf carried off by the wind; 
they bend; they become light with a human weight.
You don't forget it.'

—The statues are in the museum.'

—No, they pursue you, why can't you see it? 
I mean with their broken limbs, 
with their shape from another time, a shape you don't 
recognize 
yet know.
It's as though
in the last days of your youth you loved
a woman who was still beautiful, and you were always afraid, 
as you held her naked at noon, 
of the memory aroused by your embrace; 
were afraid the kiss might betray you
to other beds now of the past
which nevertheless could haunt you
so easily, so easily, and bring to life
images in the mirror, bodies once alive: 
their sensuality.
It's as though
returning home from some foreign country you happen
to open
an old trunk that's been locked up a long time
and find the tatters of clothes you used to wear
on happy occasions, at festivals with many-colored lights, 
mirrored, now becoming dim, 
and all that remains is the perfume of the absence
of a young form.
Really, those statues are not
the fragments. You yourself are the relic; 
they haunt you with a strange virginity
at home, at the office, at receptions for the celebrated, 
in the unconfessed terror of sleep; 
they speak of things you wish didn't exist
or would happen years after your death, 
and that's difficult because-'

—'The statues are in the museum.
Good night.'

—'-because the statues are no longer
fragments. We are. The statues bend lightly- Good
night.'

At this point they separated. He took
the road leading uphill toward the North
and she moved on toward the light-flooded beach
where the waves are drowned in the noise from the radio: 

The radio

—'Sails puffed out by the wind
are all that stay in the mind.
Perfume of silence and pine
will soon be an anodyne
now that the sailor's set sail, 
flycatcher, catfish, and wagtail.
O woman whose touch is dumb, 
hear the wind's requiem.

'Drained is the golden keg
the sun's become a rag
round a middle-aged woman's neck—
who coughs and coughs without break; 
for the summer that's gone she sighs, 
for the gold on her shoulders, her thighs.
O woman, O sightless thing, 
Hear the blindman sing.

'Close the shutters: the day recedes; 
make flutes from yesteryear's reeds
and don't open, knock how they may: 
they shout but have nothing to say.
Take cyclamen, pine-needles, the lily, 
anemones out of the sea; 
O woman whose wits are lost, 
Listen, the water's ghost-

—'Athens. The public has heard
the news with alarm; it is feared
a crisis is near. The prime
minister declared: ‘There is no more time-'
Take cyclamen- needles of pine-
the lily- needles of pine-
O woman-
—- is overwhelmingly stronger
The war-'

SOULMONGER*

The wreck 'Thrush'

'This wood that cooled my forehead
at times when noon burned my veins
will flower in other hands. Take it, I'm giving it to you; 
look, it's wood from a lemon-tree-'
I heard the voice
as I was gazing at the sea trying to make out
a ship they'd sunk there years ago; 
it was called 'Thrush, ' a small wreck; the masts, 
broken, swayed at odd angles deep underwater, like
tentacles, 
or the memory of dreams, marking the hull: 
vague mouth of some huge dead sea-monster
extinguished in the water. Calm spread all around.

And gradually, in turn, other voices followed, *
whispers thin and thirsty
emerging from the other side of the sun, the dark side; 
you might say they longed for a dropp of blood to drink; *
familiar voices, but I couldn't distinguish one from the 
other.
And then the voice of the old man reached me; I felt it
quietly falling into the heart of day, 
as though motionless: 
'And if you condemn me to drink poison, I thank you.
Your law will be my law; how can I go
wandering from one foreign country to another, a rolling
stone.
I prefer death.

Countries of the sun yet you can't face the sun.
Countries of men yet you can't face man. 

The light

As the year go by
the judges who condemn you grow in number; 
as the years go by and you converse with fewer voices, 
you see the sun with different eyes: 
you know that those who stayed behind were deceiving you
the delirium of flesh, the lovely dance
that ends in nakedness.
It's as though, turning at night into an empty highway, 
you suddenly see the eyes of an animal shine, 
eyes already gone; so you feel your own eyes: 
you gaze at the sun, then you're lost in darkness.
The doric chiton
that swayed like the mountains when your fingers touched it
is a marble figure in the light, but its head is in darkness.
And those who abandoned the stadium to take up arms
struck the obstinate marathon runner
and he saw the track sail in blood, 
the world empty like the moon, 
the gardens of victory wither: 
you see them in the sun, behind the sun.
And the boys who dived from the bow-sprits
go like spindles twisting still, 
naked bodies plunging into black light
with a coin between the teeth, swimming still, 
while the sun with golden needles sews
sails and wet wood and colors of the sea; 
even now they're going down obliquely, 
the white lekythoi, 
toward the pebbles on the sea floor.

Light, angelic and black, 
laughter of waves on the sea's highways
tear-stained laughter, 
the old suppliant sees you
as he moves to cross the invisible fields—*
light mirrored in his blood, 
the blood that gave birth to Eteocles and Polynices.
Day, angelic and black; 
the brackish taste of woman that poisons the prisoner
emerges from the wave a cool branch adorned with drops.
Sing little Antigone, sing, O sing-
I'm not speaking to you about things past, I'm speaking
about love; 
decorate your hair with the sun's thorns, 
dark girl; 
the heart of the Scorpion has set, *
the tyrant in man has fled, 
and all the daughters of the sea, Nereids, Graeae, *
hurry toward the shimmering of the rising goddess: 
whoever has never loved will love, *
in the light: 
and you find yourself
in a large house with many windows open
running from room to room, not knowing from where to 
look out first, *
because the pine-trees will vanish, and the mirrored moun-
tains, and the chirping of birds
the sea will drain dry, shattered glass, from north and south
your eyes will empty of daylight
the way the cicadas suddenly, all together, fall silent. 

I met her on a corner in Duluth
(That’s the truth.)
She was tryin’ to fix her shoe in a telephone booth
(Her name was Ruth.)
She said she was just waiting for a bus
But I hid my thumb cause I knew just what she was,
And I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker such my thumb.
It’ll drive you crazy and leave you deaf and dumb.
It’ll make you crawl and climb the wall
Leave you without no thumb at all.
So I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker suck my thumb.

I’ll tell you what them thumbsuckers like to do.
They suck your thumb till it’s wrinkled like a prune
They’ll say you’ve got the sweetest thumb of all
But then they suck the thumb of the guy livin’ down the hall
That’s why I ain’t gonna let no thumbsucker suck my thumb


(etc. . . etc. . . until finally giving in.)The thunder and lightning-
Flashes illuminating the dark of the night-
Rumbles of the thunder shattering the solace of the darkness.
Eyes wide open, listening-
The rain and wind, the consistent roar-
I take it as a sign-
I see it as an omen-
Where I am at? 
Looking out into the blackness of night.
Seeing the flashes of blinding light. .                                                            The horizon so distant, so unattainable-
The rumble of thunder-
Drowning out my shouts of fear and doubt-The scarecrow dancing
in the thunder & lightning
as if high on E

in the middle of the field
his own private rave. 

Thunder growls 
memories rush in
airplanes of war. 

There was a storm and night
darkness and fright
Then light and awareness
as though inspired by human plight
sparked awakening
which rippled through my mind
and subtly, softly, almost secretly
found a place to stay

this storm ignited light
expanded, grew
until terror ceased to be
and serenity reached a height
of almost unimaginable fullness
almost a cosmic unity
almost infinity
almost heaven
and almost authentically me


I have had my dream--like others-- 
and it has come to nothing, so that 
I remain now carelessly 
with feet planted on the ground 
and look up at the sky-- 
feeling my clothes about me, 
the weight of my body in my shoes, 
the rim of my hat, air passing in and out 
at my nose--and decide to dream no more. 

Hollow hand led shallow world your 
grave you dug for me.
To keep in sleep.
When deep within your hole I live, 
and breath.
Then die again once more each day, I am. 

Must I see, the tearing yes, give in to pain, 
that bore the best, too him, I am your grave, 
lest I forget your life within my sun, it's blinded eye.

You must be his lifer and you her padded cell.
I see denial in us all, each living death can't sell.
If I see enough and how you made me feel, 
each then and now your past you make again.

Now I can not touch your robe of black, 
it's hem I always felt, such was it once my friend.
While beating others as a child, you knew I ran away.
Organizing pain of they whom were like I, now dead.
Even now in death, you know they have no name.

That white washed house in Florida knew but pain.

I AM thy other self, what thou wilt be, 
When thou art I, the one seest now; 
In finding thy true self thou wilt find me, 
The springing blade, where now thou dost but plough. 
I am thy neighbor, a new house I've built, 
Which thou as yet hast never entered in; 
I come to call thee; come in when thou wilt, 
The feast is always ready to begin. 
Thou should'st love me, as thou dost love thyself, 
For I am but another self beside; 
To show thee him thou lov'st in better health, 
What thou would'st be, when thou to him hast died; 
Then visit me, I make thee many a call; 
Nor live I near to thee alone, but all.

Every day ends
In many ways
Entirely the same

The clock ticks quietly
Rhythmically marking
Each passing moment

My heart pounds
To the same beat
Without reluctance

My chest rises and falls
Somehow producing
Clouds of breath
In morning air

The earth spins
And gravity always happens
To pull us back to it

There are some things
We can never change


A clock ticks away
time passes by with no sound
the past fades away. 

Tick Tock of Time

The tick tock of the clock never seems to stop
Like a never ending play and you're more than a prop
Hey you, just play your role and play your role well
It's a state of mind people, there's no heaven or hell

They don't have dominion over your infinite soul
Making more money for the church is their main goal
Get off your knees, stand tall illuminated one
Never forget that we are the children of the sun

The central sun is within, there's no time here
With no time, no age, there's no rage or no fear
Rage no more, keep your emotions in check
I'm the King of Hearts, which card are you in the deck? 

Alice in Wonderland tries to understand
The deepest parts of this eternal plan
How can we wrap our minds around nothing
It's as if we are all the lord of the ring

So pick up the mirror and put down the knife
Reflection of awe in all, you are that
Inspection of all things in awe, you're the bat

Batman and Catwoman, Archetypes of all
You see what your see human, saw what you saw
The universe is seeking balance, we are all here
In the multiverse we expand the end is never near

As above so below, as within so without, near and far
And the time keeps moving forward, around and around
With every tick there's a tock, heartbeat of the clock.

Out of Order now, Such a motivating sound. 
I am done now let's see if One can be found.
Chaos back to order now, feel it in your core
You hold the key brave one, now here is the door.-W. 

R. Hill


The clock ticks loudly in this silent world, 
The only sound is time passing by.
What a funny thing it makes me want to cry.

I leave this empty home and head
To the park where I can roam alone in the dark.
Thoughts swirl through my head.
Thoughts of all the fights and rude things said.

One thing that I do look forward to is talking to you.
You always seem to make me look towards the light
Away from the darkness of this night.

All the fights and rude things said are contemplated 
By you and you always come up with something
That contradicts the things swirling through my head.
These swirling things that make me want to be dead.

Your perception is never wrong, and your perspective seems to get me everytime.
Sometimes you get mad at things I say and do
But then you say sorry and tell me what I should do.

You give me hugs and tell me its all okay, 
You tell me that life shall never fade.
Your always positive, always knowing what to do.
Your always there, I can always count on you. 

Whenever I fall your always there
Picking me up saying that life isn't always fair! 
My life is a rollar coaster travelling at the speed of light
But yet your still here on every flight.

My feelings go up and down, they never stay level
They always seem to touch the ground.

Your an angel, you have wings, so you seem to
Catch me when I dive, falling down.  

down
Then I soar for a bit and then I hit! 

But once again your there asking me if I'm hurt, saying that you care.
You then take my hand pulling me up.

I wake up from what seems to be a bad nightmare.
Oh but here I go, things start over again.
Reaccuring day by day, always falling through each day.

You stay with me in the worst of times, always there
To step in if needed showing me that you care

Your always singing a melody
Like a beautiful Nightingale.

There is so much more to say
But nothing to express it so now my words are done for today, 

I'm off to roam in the park, then home to listen to the ticking clock.
I will once again look forward to talking to you.
You see me through it all, 

And for that I'll be there for you to help you if you fall. 

TICKE[TE]D OFF
Cold urns, mold marbled busts, shelved, stored, inanimate
mock passion’s pyres unburned, fires shunned through puny life.
On Earth few still maintain their stay predestinate, 
most, weak, betray themselves until the t[h]read of strife
is severed - only then, each finds it is too late, 
trip taken only once is ended by Death’s knife.

"The Proper Study of Mankind"


These storied marble busts and urns inanimate
mock on where passions grate, avoided during life.
On Earth who still believes his stay predestinate? 
Most, tenets true betray until the t(h)    read of strife
is severed, - only then, each knows it is too late.
The trip is made but once, is ended by Death’s knife.


November  'm running out of time but that's all I got 
The time to show you baby, what you're worth 
You're always looking at me, I do stare back
But you never notice; you think I'm a clock
I'm very observant; I'm your secret admirer
My love for you is constant, I'm right here in plain sight
I'm stuck on your wall, forgotten on your desk; I'm close to your bed when you're at rest
I woke you up this morning, because of me you were early 
You keep shutting me up; could never express my feelings entirely
But I'm always back in your thoughts, because really and truly you can't do without me
In your mind, you keep imagining my presence, to keep in track with the time you remember my existence 
When my hands tick you feels so much alive but why you won't speak if you need me to survive
Every second, every minute my love for you keep growing 
But I hope that it won't take you weeks and months before you start knowing
That- tic, tic, toc; I'm not just a clock

Tickled by the sparks of Shiva consciousness 
On pasing through six chakras to seventh, (the inner Moon)  
My desire deepened and I 
Moulded my nature by pranayamas: (Deep breathing)  
Torched my liver: 
With the fire of Love: 
And thus. I found 
Graceful Shiva before me. 

Did you hear 'bout Ticklish Tom? 
He got tickled by his mom. 
Wiggled and giggled and fell on the floor, 
Laughed and rolled right out the door. 
All the way to school and then 
He got tickled by his friends. 
Laughed till he fell off his stool, 
Laughed and rolled right out of school 
Down the stairs and finally stopped 
Till he got tickled by a cop. 
And all the more that he kept gigglin', 
All the more folks kept ticklin'. 
He shrieked and screamed and rolled around, 
Laughed his way right out of town. 
Through the country down the road, 
He got tickled by a toad. 
Past the mountains across the plain, 
Tickled by the falling rain, 
Tickled by the soft brown grass, 
Tickled by the clouds that passed. 
Giggling, rolling on his back 
He rolled on the railroad track. 
Rumble, rumble, whistle, roar- 
Tom ain't ticklish any more. 

In dazzled astonishment
She looked up from her reverie
As she heard the flap of wings overhead
And saw the flash of laser beams in her dim lit room
Before her, stood a winged seraph
A radiant silhouette with such gentleness and grace
As never beholden on any human face
With its hands raised in benediction, 
It saluted Mary and said
"Blessed art thou amongst women-


The rest she heard in a trance.
Unable to comprehend what was said, 
The girl looked up nonplussed.
Again it said, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
And a son shall be born of thee


In that nanosecond of a new revelation
Did Mary’s world shatter like glassware
Or did her virgin womb thrill with new life
Did she swim in the waters of joyful tidings? 
Or gyrate in the sweeping swirl of tidal waves


For the girl already espoused to a man
In whose dreams his comely form had begun
Flitting in and out
Was it a moment of silent ravishment? 
Or of stupefied bewilderment
Did a dagger cut through her heart? 
Or did her soul take to wings in flight? ? 

Love in my heart was a fresh tide flowing 
Where the starlike sea gulls soar; 
The sun was keen and the foam was blowing 
High on the rocky shore.

But now in the dusk the tide is turning, 
Lower the sea gulls soar, 
And the waves that rose in resistless yearning 
Are broken forevermore. 

You need not burn old bridges
to keep me by your side.
The sun anoints your smile
and the moon dwells in your eyes 

No road has ever taken me
to this place where all my dreams come true
No pain could ever cut so deep, 
to think our love was through.

At times, nightmares awaken me, 
in a panic I reach to touch your hair
Your breathing reassures my tears, 
Just knowing that you are there.

If the stars fall from the heavens
and angels forget how to pray, 
if the ground demands our presence
and they carry us away
Mix our ashes in a bottle
and cast us to the sea.
Let us ride the tides of love
for all eternity. 

Watch me wallaby's feed mate. 
Watch me wallaby's feed. 
They're a dangerous breed mate. 
So watch me wallaby's feed. 
Altogether now! 



When Rocky surprised a sleeping kangaroo, 
-who awoke was scared and may have been forlorn.
The kangaroo was routed into a nearby creek, 
For the kangaroo, it was in the nearby water, --security it would seek.
The kangaroo turned on its attacker with vengeance.
The kangaroo held the dog down underwater, 
The dog writhed underwater in his submerged deadly dance.
Chris attempted to save his dog, but the kangaroo slashed him, 
The kangaroo's hind leg caught his face and abdomen.
Then Chris, though injured, caught the kangaroo's throat with his elbow.
The kangaroo left the area to catch up on lost sleep, 
- to somewhere else he would go.




Tie your heart at night to mine, love,
and both will defeat the darkness
like twin drums beating in the forest
against the heavy wall of wet leaves.

Night crossing: black coal of dream
that cuts the thread of earthly orbs
with the punctuality of a headlong train
that pulls cold stone and shadow endlessly.

Love, because of it, tie me to a purer movement,
to the grip on life that beats in your breast,
with the wings of a submerged swan,

So that our dream might reply
to the sky's questioning stars
with one key, one door closed to shadow. 


I was standing on a precipice. Technically, I was just standing in line 
at a temp job office in Oregon, but it felt like a precipice. Childhood, 
high school, and the illusion that life was good and times were easy were 
behind me. Ahead loomed the future: college, a variety of summer jobs 
to help pay for tuition, and the probability of a lonely adulthood. 
The line inched forward. I’d been waiting for what seemed like 
hours trying to get a lead on a summer job. When it was finally my 
turn, I approached the desk of a bored, tired job placement worker who 
was on the phone. The woman gestured me closer and indicated that I 
should sit down. After she hung up, I handed her some forms and she 
mechanically began the interview. 
"Name, please."
"Kelsey. Kelsey Hayes."
"Age? "
"Seventeen, almost eighteen. My birthday’s coming soon."
She stamped the forms. "Are you a high school graduate? "
"Yes. I graduated just a couple of weeks ago. I plan on attending 
Chemeketa this fall."
"Parents’ names? "
"Madison and Joshua Hayes, but my guardians are Sarah and 
Michael Neilson."Tiger’s Curse
"Guardians? "
Here we go again, I thought. Somehow explaining my life never got 
easier.
"Yes. My parents are.  deceased. They died in a car accident when 

She bent over some paperwork and scribbled for a long time. I 
grimaced, wondering what she could be writing that was taking so long.
"Miss Hayes, do you like animals? "
"Sure. Umm, I know how to feed them . . ." Is anyone lamer than me? 
Way to talk myself out of being hired. I cleared my throat. "I mean, sure, I 
love animals." 
The woman didn’t really seem to care about my response, and she 
handed me a posting for a job. 
NEEDED: 
A TEMPORARY WORKER FOR TWO WEEKS ONLY
DUTIES INCLUDE: TICKET SALES, 
FEEDING THE ANIMALS, AND
CLEANING UP AFTER PERFORMANCES.
Note: Because the tiger and dogs
need to be cared for  room and board
are provided.
The job was for the Circus Maurizio, a small family-run circus at 
the fairgrounds. I  remembered getting a coupon for it at the grocery 
store and I’d even considered offering to take my foster parents’ kids, 
Rebecca, who is six years old, and Samuel, who is four, so that Sarah and 
Mike could have some time to themselves. But then I lost the coupon 
and forgot all about it. 
"So, do you want the job or what? " the woman asked impatiently. 


In Egypt, they worshiped me
I am the Cat.
Because I bend not to the will of man
They call me a mystery.
When I catch and play with a mouse, 
They call me cruel, 
Yet they take animals to keep
In parks and zoos, that they may gape at them.
They think all animals are made for their pleasure, 
To be their slaves.
And, while I kill only for my needs, 
They kill for pleasure, power and gold, 
And then pretend to a superiority! 
Why should I love them? 
I, the Cat, whose ancestors
Proudly trod the jungle, 
Not one ever tamed by man.
Ah, do they know
That the same immortal hand
That gave them breath, gave breath to me? 
But I alone am free

 Glossy black hair swept away from his face 
and curled slightly at the nape of his neck.
His eyes were what riveted me the most. They were my tiger’s eyes, 
the same deep cobalt blue. 
Reaching out a hand, he spoke. "Hello, Kelsey. It’s me, Ren."Tyger’s Rumour


Rumour rushing rampant right

The Tyger



Tyger Tyger, burning bright, 
In the forests of the night; 
What immortal hand or eye, 
Could frame thy fearful symmetry

In what distant deeps or skies.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes! 
On what wings dare he aspire? 
What the hand, dare sieze the fire! 

And what shoulder, and what art.
Could twist the sinews of thy heart? 
And when thy heart began to beat, 
What dread hand! and what dread feet! 

What the hammer! what the chain, 
In what furnace was thy brain
What the anvil, what dread grasp, 
Dare its deadly terrors clasp! 

When the stars threw down their spear
And water'd heaven with their tears: 
Did he smile his work to see
Did he who made the Lamb make thee! 

Tyger Tyger burning bright, 
In the forests of the night: 
What immortal hand or eye, 
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry! 

William BLAKE ________


Tyger's Eye 


Tyger Tyger, once again
we'll praise your uncontested reign
where golden eye implies rebirth, 
of jungle lord's word none constrain.

From distant deeps of tropic skies.
to forests sparse where eagle flies, 
your power ripples round world's girth -
how could it e'er be otherwise? 

Strength in each and every part
needs no paltry poet's art
to illustrate your peerless worth
which rhymes through time in class apart.

Neither hammer, chain, may blind
furnace features, anvil mind, 
you represent upon this Earth
both force and freedom none may bind. 

[c] Jonathan Robin - parody William Blake written June robiblakPXX_CNX 


Tiger Siberian and Riga Balterian

Riga, Riga, brave despite
Russian army’s aimless might, 
what eternal summer sky
could liberate thy people’s sigh? 

Though the hammer, sickle, chain
sickly are, they still remain
a present threat, their might and main
must from within be toppled! – Plain? 

Fifty years the Russian reign
ignomious has spread red stain, 
fifty years too much! – again
freedom comes, no dumb refrain.

Riga, Riga, free from fright
soon, before the New Year’s Night, 
independence will attain –
light and laughter come again. 








Likable Wilma


Wilma, Wilma, in thy blouse, 
Red-haired prehistoric spouse, 
What immortal animator
Was thy slender waist's creator? 

When the Rubble clan moved in, 
Was Betty jealous of thy skin, 
Thy noble nose, thy dimpled knee? 
Did he who penciled Fred draw thee? 

Wilma, Wilma, burning bright, ye
Cartoon goddess Aphrodite, 
Was it Hanna or Barbera
Made thee hot as some caldera? 






Thomas, Thomas, going large
Down the Mall’s majestic marge, 
What mad scientist is he
Would claim to have concocted thee? 

In what oxyhydrotherm
Dwelt thy protoplasmic germ? 
In what subtle chemic spasm? 
What the hand dare seize the plasm? 

To what end, ‘neath what pretence
Arose thy utter lack of sense? 
And, bringing such a thing to pass, 
What blind fool, what silly ass? 

What the formule?  What the fault? 
In what test-tube was thy salt? 
What the bunsen? What the flame
Fused the fluid of thy frame? 

When the spars thrown down in spate
Formed thy weak precipitate, 
Did he look on it with glee –
He who, to take a case, made me? 

Thomas, Thomis going large
Down the Mall’s majestic marge, 
What mad scientist is he
Dare claim to have concocted thee? 

Wilfrid BLAIR Sa Muse s’amuse n the dark the tigers crauch, 
and out of tierdness you slouch, 
they advance, 
they advance, 
with a preditory stance. 

Times of trouble sponge solutions new, 
Intuition inks in what seemed blank.
Grief is patient.  Joy greets the dawn to thank
Hope for fresh sparks where all appeared askew.
The challenge unchains energy which through
Creative insight borrows from of the bank
Of inner strength, experience one once drank, 
Retained within the brain, respewed on cue, 
New inklings spliced with instincts tried and true.
Errors past forge futre force if frank, 
Reproachless one stays, not destructive crank.
Sincerity succeeds if luck smiles too.
Turned, tight corners open vistas which
Empower options which advances stitch. 


Okay. Fine. No, I am not okay. I won't lie and say I am. At least not anymore. I am not okay. I may look like I am. But I definitely am not. Emotionally not okay. Physically either. All this time of keeping things inside has come to an end. No more lies. No. I am not okay. I feel my heart aching more and more everyday. It's like the more days that pass the more pain I gather. I feel a biological pain in my chest, caused by emotions, those of despair and grief. They are no longer satisfied by taking over my thoughts and sentiments. They have dominated my body as well. I often am unable to stand up - literally. I feel that the brick on my chest is also a chain-and-ball keeping me a prisoner of stability. No. I am not okay. I'm tired of hearing things like, 'everything is gonna be okay' or 'time heals all wounds.' There are some things that time just cannot simply heal. Time is not a magician. 'Time' is something man-made (the definition of time; the amount of seconds in a minute, minutes in an hour, hours in a day. )  Which means that you can't actually define time. So quit giving it the illusion of being a doctor of some sort. I always thought I had more time - which maybe is one of the reasons why I am hurting to this extent, these days. I never made the best of the 'time' I had. So I didn't make enough good memories. And the ones I have already started fading away. And this is causing even more pain. 《Don't say it will get better. Don't tell me time will heal. You may have good intentions. But you don't know how I feel.》 No. I am not okay. I don't think I'll be, at least not anytime soon. After all, nothing is gonna be the same, ever again. I just burst into tears, right now, while writing this. For a million reasons, and not just one. It's really difficult, trying to put feelings into words. Some feelings, like what I'm feeling at this specific moment of 'time', are way too deep to express with different combinations of letters. There are not enough words to capture this feeling and frame it for others to see, interpret, and conclude.. Not enough answers to this one question drumming in my head: why? It seems that tears are my only real friends; they never leave when I am not happy. No. I am not okay. And I don't think I'll ever be the way I was, until hell freezes over. 


baby you are like an ocean
a train in motion
iam so in love with you 
iam in quarantine
 
its minutes past midnight
i hear your voice but u are nowhere in sight
i close my eyes and touch my lips
that is the place where you left the kiss
 
u are my icing on the cake, my sweep stake
u are my recipe for the perfect bake
u are my disguise, my paradise
the absolute truth in all the lies
 
darling u want the world at your feet
everyone else may as well accept defeat
u spread the magic and turn on the heat
your name is there on every treat 
 
as i hold u close to my chest
baby i give u my very best
our souls meet on our lips
our hearts meet on our fingertips
 
our love is like the horizon
where the sea and the sky are to meet
but the truth is that they never greet
as they trudge along parallel streets
 
we don't have to give our relationship a name
call it anything else it will still feel the same
minutes will turn into hours into days and years
all the laughter i laughed with u will turn into tears

 
in your arms i find my myself
your kiss brings me to life
so till such time comes again
i wait eagerly with bated breath. 

call your lover
don't make her wait too long
she can hide feelings better than me
but it doesn't mean she is strong

erase my lipstick mark
don't make her more jealous
she can smell the perfume
enough she knows I'm that woman

I will not apologize 
that you love me too
I will not say sorry 
that I hold you too

till love do us part
I belong to shadow and moon
because when you're in my home
is the only you that I can own

listen your lover
don't burn her heart into fire
we have all the mistakes
why argue when the die is cast

stay with her tonight
don't leave her down in sorrow
I know her eyes will tell 
she loves you as much as I do

I will not fear 
to lose your heart
I will not say goodbye
to curve her smile

till love do us part
I'm just your other lovers
because when I want you more
is the only thing I can't own


I will be the gurgling stream, 
Surmounting all your hurdles, I shall unwind, 
By the head I will drown a hundred sorrows, 
And lend you the quiet mind.

I will be a distant star, 
On all your sojourns my lights shall burn, 
Ask me for whom I shine, for a hundred light years, 
And your name, they shall not learn.

I will be the dark night, 
Wait till the moon returns every fortnight, 
Watch over you with my ten thousand stars, 
Till the dawn restores light.

I will be the bird’s call, 
In my dawn song sing your praises & promises, 
But in none of those ten thousand notes shall fall, 
The skip my heart misses.

I will be the blue skies, 
That gives your each day a new expression, 
Up there lie written a thousand sighs, 
And you can’t erase one.

I shall be the gentle breeze, 
Seeking you, glide through all your paths chosen, 
In my path bend a thousand blades of grass, 
And not rest on one.

I will be the tender blossom, 
Like a string of dewy pearls wear  all your burden, 
In a day’s deadline, brave a thousand woes, 
And not cushion from one.

I will be the mighty river, 
Thirsting to meet the sea, rush driven, 
Let thousand springs flow in my path, 
I shall not quench from one.

I shall be the raging storm, 
Through me all your tempers shall run, 
I will rumple the hair on a thousand trees, 
And not uproot one.

I will be the brilliant rainbow, 
Where ever  your dreams have trodden, 
In ten thousand wishes, gift you all my colors, 
And not save one.

I will be the spring, 
Paint you flowers as bright as a beacon, 
Shall brave the wrath of a hundred winters, 
And not a leaf will I burn.

I will be the bumble bee, 
And whine away all your inattentions
Shall steal the scent of a thousand perfumes, 
And not breathe of one.

I will be the cool wind, 
That wraps around you in the sun, 
I will part a hundred clouds, 
And not drench in one.
                                    TILL YOU COME!

THERE was a wild pigeon came often to Hinkley's timber.
 
Gray wings that wrote their loops and triangles on the walnuts and the hazel.
 
  There was a wild pigeon.
 
There was a summer came year by year to Hinkley's timber.
 
Rainy months and sunny and pigeons calling and one pigeon best of all who came.
 
  There was a summer.
 
It is so long ago I saw this wild pigeon and listened.
 
It is so long ago I heard the summer song of the pigeon who told me why night comes, why death and stars come, why the whippoorwill remembers three notes only and always.
It is so long ago; it is like now and today; the gray wing pigeon's way of telling it all, telling it to the walnuts and hazel, telling it to me.
  So there is memory.
  So there is a pigeon, a summer, a gray wing beating my shoulder.

It slows, It flys, 
It trickles, It stops.
Deathly quiet, 
you hear the pins drop.

It is eternal and timeless, 
it is time itself.
Surrounded by sorrow, 
and happiness of wealth.

It never ends, It never dies, 
even if you wanted to say goodbye.
It has no wrath, no mind of its own.
It just is, with nothing to atone.

It does not feel, 
It does not speak.
It doesn't stop, 
for the strong or the weak. 

Varied and not unique is nature of time, like Divinity; 
Time and Divinity are equally incomprehensible but understandable too; 

Time is the flow of events minding its own business
It does not wait or care for us

Movement is time; revolution of earth round the sun is time
The rise and set of The Sun and The Moon is time
The series of happenings in the universe and cosmos is time; 

Change is time; water changing to steam is time
Liquid solidifying is time
Energy at rest is time; energy in motion is time
Change relating to energy is time; 

Becoming is time
Plant becoming tree is time
Greenwood tree becoming dead-wood is time
Flowering becoming vegetable is time
Vegetable becoming fruit is time
Ripe fruits falling on the ground, is time
The onset and change of seasons is time

The infant becoming little girl is time
Girl becoming youthful is time
Youthful woman becoming mother is time
Mother becoming grand-mother is time

Onset of puberty and cessation of ovum release is time; 

Learning knowledge and gaining experience and insight is time
Recollecting, aching and forgetting is time
Things happening and their cessation is time 
Becoming indebted, achieving laurels and getting fruits of action is time
Judging is time, judge is time; 

The phases of moon is time the exhilaration and pains of heart is time
Memories, awareness, fears, anxieties
Forming past, present and future is time
The noise of actions is time 
The poison of mental torture is time; 

Is time’s passage a Straight Line?  A Circle? 

The recline of Maha Vishnu at the end of creation is time
Her volitions, urges, desire and Her Divine-Play is time 

Just as Divinity is comprehended and experienced
Through plain and pure heart so is time experienced
And comprehended through pleasant and calm mind
Else time is half-understood incomprehension; 

Personification of Peace, Silence and Bliss
And their nature is time
Intelligent Awareness is Divinity
Divine Observation is Time

Any process, activity or awareness
And their observation is time


Ain't the snow fallin' just a bit deeper these days
Aren't they building the stairs a bit steeper these days
And the town's really changin' in so many ways time time time

The young folks they're growin' exceptionally tall
And the newspaper print it's becomin' quite small
And folks speak so softly you can hardly hear at all time time time

The jokes don't seem as witty as the old jokes once were
And the girls are half as pretty as I remember her
And today you know in the park a young man called me sir time time time

Yeah I'm not quite as anxious for fame or success
And my eye finds the girl in the plain quiet dress
And I cling a bit longer to each warm caress time time time

So I breathe a bit heavy when I climb a hill
What of it my life now is really much more fulfilled
But they're tearin' down the building that I watched them build
Time time time time time time


A heart beats
a clock ticks
the years roll by

Which decides
how much time
we have


In second thoughts withdraw to pour cold water on fond hope, 
Margin call all castles in the air to dust bring 'neath the sods, 
Entropy replaces order, chaos borders balance, scope.

Time streams swiftly through our fingers, grain by grain brings joy or pain, 
Individuals, generations too, soon drown beneath its weight, 
Mystery, Life's tree, tapped, trapped in one dimension, ne'er again
Expressed is mind identical - though for rebirth some wait.


Time seeds seconds that it swallows as each follows  each to teach
Idyll; Golden Age; soon harvests, rapeseed reaped with scarce a nod, 
Mortality is empty dream, nothing living's out of reach
Ever will grim reaper gather what was given, trod to clod.

Time spins headlong, helter-skelter, alpha omega its hum, 
Innate energy refocussed, hocus-pocus drawing blind, 
Merging, surging, fresh emerging each dimension is assigned
Extra frequencies as harmonies seek equilibrium.
 
Thrust of course is force attraction contradictions overcome -
If upset the great equation’s recreated, recombined, 
Musters flux, reflux ethereal, in many ways declined -
Echo-systems spectra spectral, strata senses tuned as one.
 
Time from nano into nano ages stages fossil fuelled
Interspersing glaciation, dehydration, round and round
Myths upon examination show their roots as underground
Emerges, surface surges, strata cooled, their sense retooled.
 
Thus what once anticipation seemed probation turns as, schooled, 
Independent thought's adopted as tradition sound, profound
Marred by nations barring renovation, scar with strict surround, 
Emphasizing naught surprising, innovations over-ruled.
 
Though new cycle spins unpin past wins while progress must address
Inventively the challenges its choices stimulate, 
Migrating through some voices, denigrating other traits, 
Eliminitating those which problems pose to those whose maladdress
Tends to influence trends 'safety', 'prudence', spendthrift short-term stress.
Interests vested often soften tracks original, contest
Modus operandi handy which could statust quo divest, 
Elevating into icons past emoticon success


Time together birds of feather nests, two nurturing four more, 
In addition for perdition they're included in Life's count, 
Marking more for Death to tally, soon all rally scaffold mount, 
Ever higher populations soar, regenerating core.

 
Tortoise Time of able fable, snide greed, pride, speed, overcome, 
Is it justice?  Is it balance? Those ahead drop d[r]ead behind
Making room through swift disposals for proposals less confined, 
Express need for further testing, jesting, questing, inquest dumb.
Time, both tempter and pre-emptor, auctions choices bubble-gum
Into emptiness exploding, voices vacuum Lethe lined, 
Mirage are Man's soujourn dreams it seems, all who thereon have dined
Entertain tall expectations rich which stumble, tumble numb.

Terrifying, self-denying, self-perpetuating stream
Is steamroller bowling wicket as it tickets no return,  
Method into madness links as gladness sinks into cold urn, 
Energy is dissipated into cryogenic steam.

Time mime mutates when neccessary, with celerity translates
Into viral spiral gyral splicing, tip top icing cake, 
Monkey to man was plan began some take as grave mistake
Enterprising Time, downsizing, soon induces second state

That leads into more selection until all that came before
Isolate in microclimate dwindles into history, 
Mocking once again of mice and men eternal mystery -
'Ergo cogito' no guarantee can offer ‘sum' in store.

Time destroys its own foundations, reconstructs by rule of thumb, 
Intuition tunes to pattern ducts intelligence designed.
Mankind must press forward quickly, or its mainspring may unwind, 
Ever onward, tripping, hasty, vicious forward spiral-scrum.

Time, true master of new master, swift may slave of slave become, 
In a twinkling of an eyelid, with an inkling of the mind, 
Most by wayside fall, once falling fail to rise, we seldom find
Each with grief reach silver lining welcome, wheel spins go and come.

Time, prestidigitator, spurns prestige, turns cycle score
Into room for rust when boom goes bust, to tomb entrusts the great
Meek may seek to rise through wise disguise but dice thrown own their  fate, 
Enter on examination predetermination's maw.

Tide scorns pride which at its zenith ride descendant has prepared, 
Idyll spills its guts and penance flags, stills, pennant's breezy blow, 
Mutes the bugle's cry to rally round the cause to none compared, 
End of story, end of glory, bared or gory end below.

Through the needle wheedle riddle evolution in its drawer
Issues ready, choosy, steady, few new factors integrate. 
Measures leisure pleasure treasured as a wide tide open gate, 
Exit species flooded by fresh blooded budded to explore
Timely opportunities to tease priorities to draw
Instant conclusions from confusions which can decimate
Multitudes through feuds or manners rude to war or conjugate, 
Efforts vain again are sanctionned by Time's hoar roar none ignore.

Time, an excellent musician, is tradition's drummer, drum, 
Is clay pot and playful potter, Future's watch and spring to wind, 
Mocking mortals' puny portals, while the motives of mankind
Echo ego phase or fashion, love, hate, passion, blink sink: done.

Texts once sacred held, identical spelled, test time's sickle cell
Iteration till salvation's source course changes, redefined, 
Messiahs soon expire, out of synch with daily grind
Expressing novel govels, tocsin toll tradition's knell.

Time plays seasons, dismays reasons dumb, on much remaining mum
In/on Cause~Effect directions caught in matrix intertwined, 
Minds not evanescent effervescent reassurance blind, 
Each vibration rings strange changing strings recalculating sum.

Though if sum itself is dumb then all conclusions drawn are rum
Interjections on Time's sections, out of kilter, misaligned, 
Much in golden braid internal, waits eternal, underlined
Ever by infernal pace we race to trace out space to plumb.

Time, the predator and dater, turns the bread of life to crumb, 
Ices in a trice Life's waters, hopes as halters redefined; 
Magician fly, man hard may try, high pyramids remind
Each our power, pomp pain hour stomp, vain flowers fast succumb.

Time, no evil knows, coeval is with all, withal is none, 
Irons endings through beginnings when each innings' span's declined
Mutating, no postdating, wicketwards in double bind, 
Essence waxes, wanes, through axis, planes, yet what explains its run? 

Tempus fugit, Time is flying, soon we're lying in the dust, 
Is it dying? Is it buying time? another turn to try? 
Most would cook the books for second look, avoiding final sigh
Even though high odds against them lie when wake they take on trust.

These swift stanzas hold no moral, no bonanzas bold, no plum
Inspiring plan licks Time's trick wick untiring, predesigned, 
Mirage tidal suicidal, bridle, bridal counter signed? 
Egg and chicken plot's time-stricken as we quicken final strum. 

Whether you be the most triumphant vanguard of all civilization; or whether you be a mist of inimitably silken desire; sensuously enveloping every cranny of this beleaguered planet in cloudbursts of ardent desire, 
Whether you be an indomitably towering mountain top; or whether you be a river of perennial enchantment; cascading down the ever-pervading Himalayas, 
Whether you be a garden of celestially endowing roses; or whether you be the sky of fathomlessly invincible truth; miraculously mitigating even the most ephemeral speck of sorrow; from the periphery of this estranged Universe, 
Whether you be a timelessly resplendent star; or whether you be a boundless playground of ecstatic frolic; merrily cavorting till times beyond eternity; behind the handsomely Sun soaked hills, 
unrelentingly inexorable swirl.



Whether you be a cloud of exotically voluptuous titillation; or whether you be an impeccably spell binding saint; rising to the most sagaciously sacrosanct degrees of self control, 
Whether you be a reindeer of unlimited prosperity; or whether you be an uninhibitedly blazing wave of indefatigably unparalleled optimism, 
Whether you be a stupendously unassailable incense stick of unflinching righteousness; or whether you be an enigmatically supernatural idol; selflessly
exorcising yourself from even the most infinitesimal bit of worldly desire, 
Whether you be the everlastingly titillating voice of the enchanting nightingale; or whether you be an effervescently mystical kite; floating in invincibly untainted sky, 



Whether you be a tornado of uncanny exhilaration; or whether you be the ebulliently gyrating feathers of the peacock; under the very first drops of eternally magnificent rain, 
Whether you be the uncrowned King of the entire opalescent planet; or whether you be the most venerated poet of the century; mellifluously stirring trillions of hearts with the spirit of magical brotherhood and immortal love, 
Whether you be a brazenly revolutionary echo that defies all murderously decrepit convention; or whether you be an unconquerably princely panther; gleefully marauding at your very own will; through the bushy undergrowths of the ravishing forest, 
the most propitiously sensational limits; or be buried forever and ever and ever beneath your veritable corpse; losing to its undefeatable essence even before you were born.



Whether you be the heavenly zephyr blissfully blowing across the panoramic landscapes; or whether you be the non-invasively surreal dewdrop amiably clinging to
mother grass, 
Whether you be the most eclectic entity ever born on this gigantically blessing planet; or whether you be the ultimate harbinger of all torturously bereaved and
preposterously aggrieved humanity, 
Whether you be that leaf on the tree which never falls; or whether you be the most opulent organism on this colossal Universe; with even the saliva oozing from your mouth being of astoundingly glittering gold, 
Whether you be an apostle of timelessly impregnable peace; or whether you be an infallible chariot of unfettered success; embedding the flag of  altruistically enamoring triumph on every inch of this symbiotic earth, 

Time has always something to play for fate 
Destiny’s hands shows the right chosen way 
When to let go, when to cut loose in its rhyme 
He has the final say to our paths in time
 
To what so ever draws in our soft palms 
My love will perpetually be true to your heart
Time is passing by, something we can’t undermine
Time travels without a pause to croon its chant

Even distances cuddle us, meddling in our affairs 
my love will forever remain to see your smiling face 
I’ll be your shinning star, your guiding light 
Watching you from the distance, day and night
 
For my love is here, no matter what you do 
I shall be here by your side, loving you
We will always be each in others hearts 
Even if the oceans divide us apart 

Even distance has been a thorn in our lives 
Whiles love is the rose that bonded our hearts 
our lips pine for each others touch 
promise, the oceans will not blow away our love
 
Our hands long to be hand in hand 
Our hearts yearn to live entwine
For the rest of our lives
Oh I pray one day fate delivers you into my arms





who know'st a lenient hand to lay 
Softest on sorrow's wound, and slowly thence 
(Lulling to sad repose the weary sense) 
The faint pang stealest unperceived away; 
On thee I rest my only hope at last, 
And think, when thou hast dried the bitter tear 
That flows in vain o'er all my soul held dear, 
I may look back on every sorrow past, 
And meet life's peaceful evening with a smile: 
As some lone bird, at day's departing hour, 
Sings in the sunbeam, of the transient shower 
Forgetful, though its wings are wet the while:-- 
   Yet ah! how much must this poor heart endure, 
   Which hopes from thee, and thee alone, a cure


Time is the cosmic beat
The length of life’s yarn
It is the harbinger of change
That leaves rude etchings on the face
Making a young damsel
Turn into a wizened hag
Changing hills into plains leveled
And hollows into mounds filled! 

As time advances, life decreases
And seasons pass by us unbidden
Time rings the bell for all beginning
And it tolls the knell for all parting

Like an unbridled horse, 
As time gallops away, 
Thousands get crushed under its hooves
And many fall dead! 

Time, like a sumo wrestler, is formidable
Hard to beat down without drill and regimen
Sometimes we fly with time
Like wind blown thistledowns

Time may stay so inconspicuous
Like a tiny flea unnoticed
On the furry skin of a mangy dog
Not making its presence felt
Till unexpectedly it leaps forward, 
Vanishing into thin air! 

Many a time it assumes
Royal dimensions rich
Riding in a winged chariot! 
When it whizzes past us
Days are turned into seconds! 
But when it drags by
Hours seem eons! 

Time is something we cannot rewind
Nor be purchased with money or muscle
Never static, though at times may seem still 
And like a river, it rushes and hurtles into eternity
Sometimes mutely whispering, 
It flows into silent timelessness! 

No doubt, Time is a trickster
So erratic, so volatile
Yet so precious and so dear
More valuable than all other treasures

Oh, thinking of time
I have lost count of my time

Place and Time no meaning must retain
as time and space dust coaslesces from rust, 
no trace coherent will in time remain, 
unless some Internet ubiquitous
plays unheeded umpire virtuous
beyond the ken of mice and men, refrain
stored on pre-programmed trigger timing, just
waiting 'til intelligence again 
decides to share, decode plan's joys, Man's pain. 

sweetest ever than any fruit is the 
fruits of time
the time and the fruits

time all ripen
time you gifted me 
the time and the fruits

time to move 
then
move in time-anytime
all so fruitful-

wheels of time roll by
for the time, being you urged me to pause
and I 
everything was melting
like the water from icicles
like the steam from streams
like the mist from mountains
and
memories from mind

every moments seeping into another moment
waiting-waits melting and flowing


waiting like the gentle flowing river Brahmaputra
waiting - again and again for the season
waiting to melt
underneath
beneath breathe

when the season will breathe out 
the fragrance of jackfruits shall awaken me

and i shall run thence to that direction
with a laugh so full so maddening. 

i am happy i am mad
i am mad because of you
you are so beautiful-to remember
everything by all inside 
cosmic 
like the coco-the nut-and the water

yesterday a friend made some laddus out of coconut
and each day i have been chewing betel nut with coconut

my thirst for purity made me move
i sucked dry the coconut and the water
pious i felt-what a feeling

like the fog that all fell frozen 
when you whispered to the wind
everything magically appeared from disappear
time and the fruit
to show the fruit-for the juice was inside you said

and-
slowly -
like the lights from the cleavage of Sohra Nohkalikai Waterfalls 

fell on to the bosom of the earth

reflection of pure light- 
there and then 
the pure light fell on me.  

Time and time again, 
I get to this place.
When there is no return, 
Where I can't see her face.

This room is called my heart, 
Which is broken and shattered.
Starting to crumble apart.
Totally shreddered.

Time and time again, 
I return to my past.
Where I can't let free.
All those feelings that last.

This border is called my soul.
Which I can't break through.
Starting to feel weak, 
Believing it isn't true.

Time and time again, 
I'm running away.
Not knowing where.
With my feelings that stay

This time I can't explain, 
I wish I could.
I will never be released, 
When I think I should. 

Time and time and time
again
i've sought a perfect rhyme
time and time and time
again
it just comes to me
when
those times and times and times and times
i've searched for that one
word
i think that writing poetry is something quite
absurd
you balance on the tightrope and then sometimes
lose 
your 
nerve. 


Across the mountains of once believed. 
Where Good Shepherds Lead Their Flock-
I found a sweetheart residing there-
Who ignored the hands of the clock; 

Over the mountains of Majesty. 
Under the skies deep paisley blue-
I found a sweetheart residing there-
Who promised to love me true; 

Leaving me nary a broken heart. 
Painting rainbowed dreams inside of my head. 
Leading me down the path of no return. 
Into the Garden Of Love I was led; 

Once in the ecstacy of this floral dream-
We wrapped ourselves into: 'One'
Embracing one another as no other. 
Under Edens most heated Sun; 

Times sand granules fell in the hourglass. 
With too many paths left for you to run. 
One day you just up and walked away. 
Stating matter of factly that we were done; 

You had second and third thoughts. 
With so many more mountains to climb. 
So many challenges and paths left inside of you-
Are the reasons for this heart-felt rhyme; 

There is a time for each-a season. 
Under the Sun-whether or not as: 'One'
A time to love and a time to live. 
And a time when our seasons are done;


Time consumes all-fine or rough, 
Good or bad, soft or tough.
Time consumes all like an ant, 
Slowly and silently that we can't
Understand the bites and feel, 
Slowly Times takes us to kill
With its palms-dark and cold, 
Making us weak-young or old.
Time is blind, knows not new or old, 
Monument or palace, diamond or gold.
But Time has a sense, 
It brings us a change.

So life has handed you  sour grapes, 
They're bitter and hard to swallow -
But you'll be just fine
Sour grapes make good wine
If you throw in enough sweet sugar; 

So lemons are the fruit of the day, 
So sour your lips start to pucker -
Just make lemonade
A tall glass in the shade
Will refresh on a hot summer day; 

So your garden has grown green tomatoes, 
That just won't turn red in the sun -
Fry them up in a pan
Make some relish to can
What a wonderful change of taste! 

Whenever life throws you a curve ball
When you were expecting a hit -
Then you should be guessin'
You're learning a lesson

.
It's time for a change of scenery. 

Time is 
Too Slow for those who Wait,
Too Swift for those who Fear,
Too Long for those who Grieve,
Too Short for those who Rejoice;
But for those who Love,
Time is not. 

Time flows
Like the perennial river
Time rides the crest
Of a wave in the sea
Time's space
Its fourth dimension
Time's elastic
Keeps on bouncing
Time's a sponge
Absorbs all spills
Time sleeps
Time wakes up
Time walks
Time runs
Time races
Time stands still
Time flies fast
Time has past
Time has future
Time never stays in the present
Time creeps
Time ticks
Time tricks
Sometimes good
Sometimes bad
Time's night
Time's day
Time's dark
Time's bright
Time's heavy
Time's light
Time's easy
Time's hard
Time blinks like eye
Time beats like heart
Time makes
Yoktosecond large
Time turns
Exasecond too small
Time lets one fall
Time makes one rise
Time's magic
Time brings one to life
From nowhere
Time makes one vanish
In an instant
Time's all
That we know
Time's everything else 
That we don't. 

Like the ghost of a dear friend dead
Is Time long past.
A tone which is now forever fled,
A hope which is now forever past,
A love so sweet it could not last,
Was Time long past.

There were sweet dreams in the night
Of Time long past:
And, was it sadness or delight,
Each day a shadow onward cast
Which made us wish it yet might last--
That Time long past.

There is regret, almost remorse,
For Time long past.
'Tis like a child's beloved corse
A father watches, till at last
Beauty is like remembrance, cast
From Time long past. 

Time and memory -

Dark night
. 

sound of rain 
A sad note breaking the silence 

The howling owl flies away
.

Life in melancholy wrapped in doubt
Sound of wings through the cold night-
Darkness that makes you sick, pale


makes you shout 
In despair, what is wrong and what is right.

*                  *                      *

Time heals, they say
And memory took that away-
And they survive to serve 
Life in a tray-
Happiness, sadness- a mixed theme of life 
Till you close your eyes for all that to strive 

*                     *                    * 

Time stumbles on a momentary sleeplessness


As the nightmare makes you shrink, tears rolling down
And you smile to the destiny -to the lost crown 
An attempt failed to resist the restlessness
.

*                        *                    *

Known faces down the memory lane, all pale and fade

Laughing at you  
From the pages of the old album 
All eager to hide the agony sounding an empty drum

Colour of blood is no more red


*                     *                      *

Tomorrow is yet to die-lets all pray
Time heals wounds and memory takes them away-


*                     *                      *

Codswallop as we know it was first invented by simple people 
with time on their hands to pass it around in: they could see it 
there, criss-crossing the land of give and take. They wanted 
plenty, and got it too. For years it proved a subtle itch, but just 
as one thing leads to the next, irrevocably speaking, so it 
eventually came to pass that an ache developed and a cry went 
up: "Which way now, boss?" And so it has gone ever since: 
your guess is good, like mine, yet both bear the imprint of 
imaginary outcomes – promises, if not signed undertakings, that 
the rash passed between us will, in hindsight, signal an 
agreement. It’s the fine lines between things that count. Palms! 
Eternal repayment’s upon us, deduced but never deducted from 
sums that cause the far-flung stars to twinkle and villagers to 
wink okay. But this leads on to a future more sophisticated and 
gay than any I’m likely to gad about in. Hence the twin horns of 
the dilemma. 


Help how much my heart  hurts
my mouth is as dry as a desert 
my throught is sore
my voice is a goner
my heart is beating as fast as a tiger 
my hand is a rattling snake 
my face is a tomato 
bye bye, boring life
i cannot take it no more
i lay my head 
upon my knee
now blow the whistle refree


I meticulously counted the number of waves; rising and falling in the majestically undulating sea, I sang occasionally with the birds; humming a myriad of spell binding tunes, 
I tore a sheet of lanky dilapidated paper; into measly bits of orphaned fragments, 
I nonchalantly kicked each stone that confronted me in my way; hurling it high and handsome towards mystical puffs of sky, 
O! yes the overwhelming burden on my shoulders seemed to be augmenting each minute; the hour incorrigibly refrained to fly; and for me at the current moment
life was nothing but a big time pass. 

I shooed the birds sitting tranquilly on the jaded rocks; chasing them till the point I wholesomely collapsed in a bedraggled heap on cold ground, 
I made boundless sandcastles in insurmountably slippery sand; dismantling them as they gathered the slightest of solid proportion, 
I held my ear abysmally close to the hollow walls; awaiting for the tiniest of sound that simply wasn't there, 
I indefatigably kept chanting a silly tune; giving it the pompously pretentious status of being the astronomical best, 
O! yes the overwhelming burden on my shoulders seemed to be augmenting each minute; the hour incorrigibly refrained to fly; and for me at the current moment
life was nothing but a big time pass. 

I voraciously rubbed my glasses till the time they shone vivaciously bright; although they were already  sparkling more than the mid-day Sun, 
I tied my handkerchief into unfathomable number of folds; spent countless moments thereafter in entangling the disdainful mess of my insane creation, 
I washed my body vigorously all throughout the night; evacuating the last bit of superficial dirt that just wasn't to be seen, 
I flipped through pages of the bulky history book; browsing through an unending labyrinth of dates; with beads of exasperating sweat trickling feverishly down my nape, 
O! yes the overwhelming burden on my shoulders seemed to be augmenting each minute; the hour incorrigibly refrained to fly; and for me at the current moment
life was nothing but a big time pass.
 
I yawned like a maniacally fanatic; although the bones incarcerated in my body rared to surge forward with spurts of exuberant enthusiasm, 
I chewed slices of tangy gum for times immemorial; evolving a cocoon of bubbles only to obnoxiously burst them, 
I incoherently scribbled gargantuan tons of literature on barren paper; expending Herculean loads of my lazy frustration on my tiny little fountain pen, 
I relentlessly kept tapping my nimble feet; scowling in inexplicable disdain at whomsoever who encountered me in my way.
O! yes the overwhelming burden on my shoulders seemed to be augmenting each minute; the hour incorrigibly refrained to fly; and for me at the current moment
life was nothing but a big time pass.

O Time- sweet time! Thy gifts eternal and blissful; 
Passing silently sprinkling stream of joys and sorrows unmindful, 
Enormous are gifts souls blessed with of time bountiful, 
Time's hand filled with wondrous magic skills, 
Brings about a lot of transformations, 
In many a thing, living and non-living, beyond imagination. 

Mysterious is thy birth, souls muse upon where and when, 
And when time thinks of you-You are born 
Then thy gift so rare and so divine, 
That rare human birth by thee in earth divine. 

And time wasting no time brings in, in quick succession, 
Your childhood, your youth, your old age and life's occasion. 
Precious are thy gifts I cherish, love, and cling to my heart, O Time divine, 
And thy gift 'Sai' of shirdi to the world so precious like a jewelled mine, 
That in life to part with, souls wish never for a moment even. 

For I know I shall be stripped of those loved gifts soon by thy exquisite design, 
And unto the grave I shall be dragged soon to abide by thy eternal rules 
divine, 
For I know none of thy precious gifts shall with us ever remain, 
And that under thy rule have risen and perished many an empire, 
nation and civilization, 
Me likewise in the stream of time shall rise and fall without exception. 

But my love for Him shall rise and rise and never to wane 
Yet I plead O Time spare thy exclusive gift me blessed with, 
The love, big love, sun of love- eternal and blissful, 
My Ishwar, my Krishna, my Rama, my Buddha, my Kabir and my Sadguru, 
In the stream of time from perishing and fading into oblivion. 

Let my love for Him grow with thy care utmost, 
And when I leave for Heaven and Him there I meet, 
Manifold my love for Him would have grown, 
And towards immortality it would have gone. 
O Time-sweet time! Thy gifts eternal and so blissful. .. 

Vast sea's  tireless, uneasy waves
riding upon their own coughed up salty foam
sweep the surface in competitive stained strips.

In hues of cyan-blue
marine iridescent shiver restless gleams, 
while the gently blowing breeze gives the pulse and rhythm.

Wings of helices - as underneath- in twiddling perpetual, 
time's hydrindexes on movement  up 'n down territorial.

The coffee was cold so I said so. I said,
my coffee is cold, and then I repeated it
but with a variation, something like, my
coffee is cold and I said so, and then, I
said I am glad my coffee is cold because
I get to say so, and I said my coffee is cold
like the Sahara at night, and I said the Sahara
is a lot like my coffee, which has cream,
and it is cold which means I have to say so
or someone will say to drink my coffee,
which is cold and the camels are asleep.

Let's try it again, I said, taking a sip of coffee,
and then not taking a sip but still holding
the cup and I said look at the cup and see
if you can see the Sahara and then I said,
it was in there a moment ago but I took a sip
and it is inside me I suppose, and I said then
the same thing, my coffee is cold, and also,
this coffee is cold to make sure they knew
which coffee, not coffee as coffee but coffee
as a part of the whole and also immediate
in some sense, like waking in the desert.

I write a lot about coffee, I said, and I said,
I just need to see who my friends are, the ones
who will stay till the end, and I added, I do not
take death as a personal insult, and I said it was
good to repeat things but not ideas, and I said
it was not good to repeat ideas, and I said also
it was good to repeat things, and I said my coffee
is cold and I can say so and I said when I say
my coffee is cold it is part of something bigger
that can last as long as I say it is, still is, and then
I said my coffee is still cold at this time, still is. 


There is no past
but memories; no future
save imaginings. 

The worst is yet to come, 
It may not be for you.
It may be for some, 
For me it's true.

I hate the waiting in my bed
Waiting for the days.
That get me so sad.
Take me away from this place.

It seems time stands still, 
The days feel like years.
I lost my life and will, 
I've only got my fears.

Hoping that time will pass me by, 
Saving me from my sadness.
Trying to figure out this lie, 
I turn myself to madness. 


Sometimes what I really need is some space, some time alone, away from everyone and everything.. 

Is that too much to ask? I'm tired of always being there for everyone I need some time for myself, by myself.. 

I can't take all the pressure put upon me by others anymore.. 

All I want is some time off just to get my mind off of certain things


Why isn't anyone understanding that I'm a human too? That I can't always keep my mouth shut and my feelings burried? That eventhough I have the urge to cry, I can't because it will hurt a few? That I'm trying to stay strong but I'm actually breaking down inside? That no matter the situation I have to always be there for the ones who need me, and that it's tougher than boulders? I can't take it anymore.. 

I think that I'm still in denial, and that I still can't quite grasp what I'm supposed to do.. 

I don't need company to figure things out.. 

It may be wrong, but I'd rather be alone than between people who are probably more confused at the time than I am, even if they claim to be needing me next to them.. 

But not everything is always about everyone else.. 

I need some time alone.. 

And until you understand that, there is nothing you can possibly say or do that can make me change my mind, because you think you know what's better for me when imposing the 'forever together and never apart' thing to me, but not everything lasts forever.. 

And sometimes we have to be alone to understand the importance of togetherness.. 

All I need is time alone.


Like a blow with a fist
That moment I knew
What you did then
And contnue to do

In that instant I knew
What I'd gone through
Was mainly all
Because of you

Yet, I've done nothing wrong
Which you surely must know
All I can think of
You just hate me so

Another lesson learned
And at least I now know
It is time to move on
It is time to let go


Am careening into the future; 
cannot help but live in the present
and, every day, I travel the past- -
just don't bring my body. 

I feel feelings people never feel
Things people never seen, things that used to be real
Look through these eyes
I’m told they show me nothing but lies

They see colors no one ever knew
Yellow mixed with green but the color isn't blue
They say I must have hit rewind
I’m seeing things back in time

History and the present appear to be seaming
Dinosaurs chasing me and I’m not dreaming
X-rays of my mind
Telling me I could be blind

Yet I’m seeing things only in your imagination
The extinct world of past’s creation
Every door to my life was closing
Yet I’m here, no longer cryonically frozen


Time when simpler things
were the deal.
Deal me a date with
delight.
A matter of trust.
Heaven or bust.
Everything in life is
not free.
Free me up for love.
Love how do you 
spell it? 
It grows with all the right
ingredients.
Spice, vice, nice.
Nice a place on the French Rivera.
Where does this river flow? 
The ebb tide of romance.
Time & its magical
mystery tolls the bell. 


We have crossed nearly a decade 
days have passed like wind
Still we know not much of each other
Oh my Dear! ! 
where are we to? ? 

We haven't understood each others heart
we haven't felt each others need or feel.
still.  

for all these days we did care for each other



Come to me during the night my love, -
Through the terrace garden’s rear door; 
To smother my flaming passion, -
With your kisses and foaming snow! 
While I rest a while in your arms my love, -
With my beating heart going fast to slow! 
But you must leave by stealth my love, 
Before the cock begins to crow! 
You remain like a dark thought in my 
mind, -
Which I keep hidden from the light of
day! 
The sparkle you leave in my eyes, -
I cover with dark glasses during the day! 
Like a red colored blossom my love, 
During the day I remain all closed! 
To open up at night for you, -
To bloom like a lovely rose! 
And as my petals open and bloom, -
You must inhale its sweet perfume! 
Let my fragrance cast a spell on you, -
When at dawn you take your flight; 
So that you remember to visit me, -
During the dark hours of the night! 
And should someone jealous of our love, 
Should hunt you or strike you down! 
I too shall jump into your grave, -
To remain with you underground! 


Not you, not me
Time is now reading this secret so slowly and reveal it

But to you i dare to say

If a rose is a book of two hearts
You must be those petal pages
We bound together in a chapter
In folded pages of blooming roses

Not you nor anyone
Who knows our written fate? 

One day when time claims youth from a rose
When beauty of our days just not the same
I know scent still bind to petals
We die and all stories buried together

Even there is fault of our star
The shine won't fading away
It remains at the midnight sky

Of our secret fate
Leave ignorance to bliss
No one knows what it will be
Neither you nor me


But the moment i am having now
it just timeless masterpiece
it just timeless masterpiece
Immortal touch of scent to petals

Just let we live this moment
to be our timeless masterpiece


The best poem of a poet
Is the last one he says
Poems written before seem
To be forgotten entities

Only fresh poems get
Comments one or two
Uncommented old poem's
A misplaced book on shelf.

Freshness' what we look for
In fruit, vegetable, or meat
Freshness' all that matters
In everything that we eat.

Yet old is gold we say
And enjoy old poems
Old masters we never
Forget even in dreams.

Their poetry shines for ever
We're happy to memorize lines
Our own old poems we note
Were fresh when they appeared.

Dear poet let poetry live
Write and deliver'em fresh
All your poems one day'll
Be appreciated as timeless. 

The sea of time flowed from
chaos.

It whistled in the solar winds
unseen.

Into the mind of man it settled 
still unseen, but felt.

In pulsating neuronic implications
flourishing conceptually.

From the past it came whistling into
the past creeping invisibly.

Time is past, there is no present, or
future.

If it was your lusciously mesmerizing lips that wonderfully whispered; then it was my ardently igniting kisses that would do every bit of the timelessly enthralling talking, 

If it was your fantastically hazel eyes that tranquilly whispered; then it was my indefatigably vivacious eyelashes that would do every bit of the timelessly flirtatious talking,  

If it was your intrepidly celestial ears that charismatically whispered; then it was my inexhaustibly exploring tongue that would do every bit of the timelessly exploring talking, 

If it was your seductively redolent feet that uninhibitedly whispered; then it was my irrefutably infallible trail that would do every bit of the timelessly adventurous  talking, 

If it was your daintily articulate fingers that unrestrictedly whispered; then it was my magically ameliorating artistry that would do every bit of the timelessly passionate talking, 

If it was your celestially symbiotic shoulders that fantastically whispered; then it was my innocuously pristine selflessness that would do every bit of the timelessly redolent talking, 

If it was your enigmatically unruly armpits that seductively whispered; then it was my pricelessly golden perspiration that would do every bit of the timelessly bountiful talking, 

If it was your impeccably nubile chin that ebulliently whispered; then it were my infinite enamoring goose-bumps that would do every bit of the timelessly undefeated talking, 
 
If it was your voluptuously ardent breasts that resplendently whispered; then it was my unceasingly kneading palms that would do every bit of the timelessly unbridled talking, 

If it was your iridescently embellished belly that jubilantly whispered; then it was my unstoppably machismo hunger that would do every bit of the timelessly intermingling talking, 

If it was your triumphantly truthful veins that ecstatically whispered; then it was my unassailably crimson blood that would do every bit of the timelessly blessed talking,  
If it was your innovatively intriguing brain that unrestrictedly whispered; then it was my astoundingly fathomless fantasy that would do every bit of the timelessly exhilarating talking, 

If it was your exotically desirous thighs that spell bindingly whispered; then it was my uncannily untamed electricity that would do every bit of the timelessly fervent talking, 

If it was your unbelievably mellifluous throat that gorgeously whispered; then it was my inimitably new-born voice that would do every bit of the timelessly effulgent talking, 

If it was your beautifully sculptured toes that inscrutably whispered; then it was my unfathomably magical shadow that would do every bit of the timelessly endowing talking,  

If it was your piquantly hissing panic button that surreptitiously whispered; then it was my mischievously nibbling teeth that would do every bit of the timelessly reinvigorating talking, 

If it was your insuperably Omniscient nostrils that beautifully whispered; then it was my immortally unsinkable life that would do every bit of the timelessly united talking, 

If it was your perpetually throbbing heart that clandestinely whispered; then it was my unconquerably undying love that would do every bit of the timelessly coalescing talking, 

And if unfortunately;  not even the most infinitesimal iota of your mind; body or soul ever whispered; then even without the tiniest of your tangible innuendo; each beat of my heart; blood and breath would still forever and ever and ever bond with every aspect of your philanthropically emollient life; would still forever and ever and ever do every bit of the timelessly inseparable talking. 

I had been reading the
literary supplement
if I were an anthropologist or social apologist
I'd find it possible to assimilate
their adverts and perverts

and all the other mixed up beings
and jelly beans, Mexican jumping beans
Pythagorean beans and more beans
we have tasted beans of knowledge, 

had I discarded and littered the garden
no beanstalk would have sprouted, 
Oh, Jack the Giant what the hell
it's only recycled paper


I was born in the morning of the world,
So I know how morning looks
morning in the valley wanting,
morning on a mountain wanting.
Morning looks like people look,
like a cornfield wanting corn,
like a sea wanting ships.
Tell me about any strong, beautiful wanting,
And there is your morning, my morning,
everybody's morning.(Sea Warfare)


The ships destroy us above
    And ensnare us beneath.
We arise, we lie down, and we move
    In the belly of Death.

The ships have a thousand eyes
    To mark where we come . . .
But the mirth of a seaport dies
    When our blow gets home. 

Though you know it anyhow 
Listen to me, darling, now, 
Proving what I need not prove 
How I know I love you, love. 
Near and far, near and far, 
I am happy where you are; 
Likewise I have never larnt 
How to be it where you aren't. 
Far and wide, far and wide, 
I can walk with you beside; 
Furthermore, I tell you what, 
I sit and sulk where you are not. 
Visitors remark my frown 
Where you're upstairs and I am down, 
Yes, and I'm afraid I pout 
When I'm indoors and you are out; 
But how contentedly I view 
Any room containing you. 
In fact I care not where you be, 
Just as long as it's with me. 
In all your absences I glimpse 
Fire and flood and trolls and imps. 
Is your train a minute slothful? 
I goad the stationmaster wrothful. 
When with friends to bridge you drive 
I never know if you're alive, 
And when you linger late in shops 
I long to telephone the cops. 
Yet how worth the waiting for, 
To see you coming through the door. 
Somehow, I can be complacent 
Never but with you adjacent. 
Near and far, near and far, 
I am happy where you are; 
Likewise I have never larnt 
How to be it where you aren't. 
Then grudge me not my fond endeavor, 
To hold you in my sight forever; 
Let none, not even you, disparage 
Such a valid reason for a marriage. 

Leaves trickling down from weeping trees, 
tumbling along in sprightly dance.
Gathering in heaps, as swirls the breeze, 
as if it is their only chance, 
to show the world what they can do, 
before the winter’s snow is due.

They live for but one single year, 
from birth to death, so short a span.
And yet with verve they persevere, 
pushing through bark as best then can, 
blanketing well each branch they dress, 
giving a show to so impress.

All earth’s colours, gold, greens and browns, 
red, orange, yellow, rust and black.
Rich remnants of some wondrous gowns, 
all strewn now on the hard tarmac.
Autumn in tints and tones and shades.
Splendour in colourful brocades.



Within dream
We swim
Cat fish

Flowers cute aromatic
Nights heavenly days amusing
Sketch of nascent love

Fluorescent light into drain 
Frog's tongue towards insect 
Cool fate

Billboard lady
Restless smile
Quality

Non-loving shade walking 
Clouds peep from sapphire windows
Redundant longing

Erase delet remove
Eliminate clean wipe
Memory germinates

She knows well
To go or to stop
Morning yawning


Tiny Feelings Love or hunger is equal to 
Development or culture is equal to 
War or peace

Algebra demand
Geometry supply
Equilibrium fled from life

Quasi assurance
Trojan price hike
Analog fate

Shade of orchid
Crossing elastic limit
Penniless autumn

Hugging dragonfly 
Couple on bed
teeth of autumn

Already read the sounds 
On the footpath
Line of ants

Ass is the dream of mule
Desire to shift the higher indifference curve
Moon is the satisfaction


A child's tiny feet, 
Blue, blue with cold, 
How can they see and not protect you? 

Tiny wounded feet, 
Bruised all over by pebbles, 
Abused by snow and soil! 

Man, being blind, ignores 
that where you step, you leave 
A blossom of bright light, 
that where you have placed 
your bleeding little soles 
a redolent tuberose grows. 

Since, however, you walk 
through the streets so straight, 
you are courageous, without fault. 

Child's tiny feet, 
Two suffering little gems, 
How can the people pass, unseeing. 

Tiny little toes that should have touched the ground
Precious little cries that never made a sound
An unborn body that never got a face
Leaving swiftly without a trace

Happiness disappears like the sun at night
Anger that knows there is no victorious fight
Holding on to what could have been
Smiles on faces that only pretend

Memories that were not made to keep
As fate would have it, only to seek
But the love inside only grows strong
Firm and unbroken is the bond

My angel flies high with wings above
When the time comes I will understand

But for now I am here just looking up
Seeing the clouds and feeling your love
And as time goes by I will come along


Fish oh! fish
swish a miss
wish on hiss
shush to hush

Push push
oh! fish
flush a blush
fresh 'n' mush

Fish oh! fish
slush the gush
slash in gash
splash the plush

Fish oh! fish
pose to posh
rush a mash
fish oh! gosh

The world's number one killer
I wonder why it hasn't yet made its way
Into a horror movie thriller
Why, though it could beat
Even the serial killer! 

Oh it gets even past locked doors
Through the tiniest of holes and pores
And however tiny
It bodes fatality
For to many its bites
Have been lethal, fatal
And it sings freely in your ears
But like a teeny weeny vampire

Don't you undermine the miniscule, the minute
For tis a real-life miniature vampire
Tis a blood sucking brute! 

And they come in hordes
Without guns or swords
This major yet tiny killer of humans
Though you might kill with a flick of your hands
Yet you could never wipe out the whole band
From the face of the earth
What with its prolific birth! 
As this is one flying army here to stay
And by hook or by crook
In each and every nook
It shall share our land! 

How terrible that our blood is on its main menu
My and your blood its main staple diet
So I warn you fellow humans
Save yourselves from the anopheles's bite.

Call it mosquito or agent of malaria
Plasmodiums are far worse than any bacteria

And they aren't just doing their job
They're doing their bloody feeding
We ain't in paradise yet: thus both the harmful and harmless are breeding!


'Tis customary as we part
A trinket—to confer—
It helps to stimulate the faith
When Lovers be afar—

'Tis various—as the various taste—
Clematis—journeying far—
Presents me with a single Curl
Of her Electric Hair—'Tis good—the looking back on Grief—
To re-endure a Day—
We thought the Mighty Funeral—
Of All Conceived Joy—

To recollect how Busy Grass
Did meddle—one by one—
Till all the Grief with Summer—waved
And none could see the stone.

And though the Woe you have Today
Be larger—As the Sea
Exceeds its Unremembered Drop—
They're Water—equally—'Tis little I—could care for Pearls—
Who own the ample sea—
Or Brooches—when the Emperor—
With Rubies—pelteth me—

Or Gold—who am the Prince of Mines—
Or Diamonds—when have I
A Diadem to fit a Dom—
Continual upon me—

Tis sweet to think that, where'er we rove, 
We are sure to find something blissful and dear, 
And that, when we're far from the lips that we love, 
We've but to make love to the lips we are near.
The heart, like a tendril, accustom'd to cling, 
Let it grow where it will, cannot flourish alone, 
But will lean to the nearest and loveliest thing 
It can twine with itself, and make closely its own. 
Then oh! what pleasure, where'er we rove, 
To be sure to find something, still, that is dear, 
And to know, when far from the lips we love, 
We've but to make love to the lips we are near. 

'Twere a shame, when flowers around us rise, 
To make light of the rest, if the rose isn't there, 
And the world's so rich in resplendent eyes, 
'Twere a pity to limit one's love to a pair. 
Love's wing and the peacock's are nearly alike, 
They are both of them bright, but the're changeable too, 
And wherever a new beam of beauty can strike, 
It will tincture Love's plume with a different hue. 
Then oh! what pleasure, where'er we rove, 
To be sure to find something, still, that is dear, 
And to know, when far from the lips we love, 
We've but to make love to the lips we are near.


Tis the last rose of summer 
Left blooming alone; 
All her lovely companions 
Are faded and gone: 
No flower of her kindred, 
No rose-bud is nigh, 
To reflect back her blushes, 
Or give sigh for sigh. 

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! 
To pine on the stem; 
Since the lovely are sleeping, 
Go, sleep thou with them. 
Thus kindly I scatter 
Thy leaves o'er the bed, 
Where thy mates of the garden 
Lie scentless and dead. 

So soon may I follow, 
When friendships decay, 
And from Love's shining circle 
The gems drop away. 
When true hearts lie wither'd, 
And fond ones are flown, 
Oh! who would inhabit 
This bleak world alone.


'Tis time, I think, by Wenlock town 
The golden broom should blow; 
The hawthorn sprinkled up and down 
Should charge the land with snow. 

Spring will not wait the loiterer's time 
Who keeps so long away; 
So others wear the broom and climb 
The hedgerows heaped with may. 

Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge, 
Gold that I never see; 
Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge 
That will not shower on me. 

Now that our path meet,  we become soujouners on a journey
Our lives mingle on a single purpose guided by destiny
I shall stand by you, as you shall stand by me, 
You shall bring beauty and order in my life as I shall in your house, 
Fill all the empty spaces in your heart as you shall in our house, 
It shall be –Tit for tat.

Assuage all the hurts and slights gathered in my absence 
like you would toss away mine, 
To be your lucky charm as you were always mine, 
It shall be –Tit for tat.
But I’m yet to get over the fact that I  once
 left this message on your door
- Tit for tat. 

Unsinkable it was called by many.
But those were oh so silly.
They thought it was indestructible, 
but to icebergs, it was very sinkable.

The Unforgettable Titanic

Thousands of people boarded one day, 
and they were going to stay.
But their trip was going to be cut short
due to damage in the port.

The Unforgettable Titanic

They thought they could make to the U. 

S. 

A, 
but that thought would be banished on that one day.
It wasn't suppose to happen that way.
Afloat it should have stayed.

The Unforgettable Titanic

So just remember professionals built the Titanic, 
but amateurs built the ark. 

Blood red was the cloud
When the Titanic did depart
An omen in the sky
That no one took to heart

She was the largest luxury ship
That ever sailed the brine
Fancy fixtures everywhere
The quarters were divine

They said she was unsinkable
Until she faced the test
And so it was unthinkable
Her construction was the best

The night was black as a raven's beak
When the lookout did exclaim
But no effort was made to slow the speed
When the reports of icebergs came

First officer ordered ‘Hard to Port'
But it was way too late
The iceberg ripped the ‘impenetrable' hull
She had met her terrible fate

Five waterproof compartments leaked
And the water in did flow
It soon was found that the front of the ship
Was headed down below

As front went down, the rear went up
Two blocks into the air
A mighty groan and tearing caused
Crew and passengers to despair

A mighty splat rang out in the frigid cold
When the Titanic broke in two
It was a very frightful time
For the passengers and the crew

Lifeboats had to be employed
The owners thought they had plenty
But she could carry sixty-four
But carried only twenty

Captain and crew were not well trained
As they sent the boats to shore
A lot more people could have been put in
They could have carried many more

The sea was as cold as a witch's nose
For those that couldn't swim
Fifteen-hundred people lost their lives; 
Statistics that are grim

The moon was heaven's porthole
For those who they couldn't save
Their spirits wanted to go up, 
Their bodies went to a watery grave

So what caused the Titanic to sink? 
Pride, arrogance, slothfulness & greed
And maybe some other type of sin? 
Let's learn from past mistakes, indeed

It might have sunk like frigid ice to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where unconquerable royalty radiated from even the most infinitesimal element, 

It might have sunk like non-existent air to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever consider the Titanic as a ship; where the true flavor of all fraternities of humanity; reigned emotionally charged and supreme at all times, 

It might have sunk like a new born infant to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where there perennially wafted an impregnable atmosphere of pricelessly eternal compassion, 


It might have sunk like a deplorably defeated teardrop to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where the heavens of the most ultimate fantasy ruled supreme; in even the most blackened corners; tapestries; cisterns and stairs, 
 
It might have sunk like a lifeless solider to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where the definition of true sacrifice was immortalized; like never before on this fathomless planet, 

It might have sunk like an amorphous ant to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where there flew kisses of all sizes and shapes; in every conceivable direction; poignant and galore, 

It might have sunk like besmirched sour cream to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where there was a perfect blend of people of virtually every religion; traveling to the most cherished 
destination of their life, 

It might have sunk like disdainfully shattered glass to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where there the finest wine and cuisine were ecstatically served in one half; whilst the other; perpetually rejoiced and unabashedly danced to the tunes of rum and humanity, 

It might have sunk like meaningless vacuum to the rock bottom of the ocean; 
but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where the longest insatiable locking of two lips into a kiss; was ever registered on this boundless enamoring planet, 

It might have sunk like impoverished chowder to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where the most inimitably cherishable moments of existence; were lived by thousands; within just two days, 

It might have sunk like neglected seaweed to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where the heart of the infallibly intrepid sea; was inscrutably captured within each pristine wall, 

It might have sunk like despicably thwarted ash to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where an insuperable ensemble of artists; exuberantly sang till their very last breath; even as 
hell unstoppably rained around, 

It might have sunk like despairing oblivion to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where thousands prayed for rhapsodic life and happiness; affably holding hand in hand and together, 

It might have sunk like a fecklessly butchered whisker to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where the most unconquerably golden moments of passion; were captured with astounding propensity upon the fabric of white canvas, 

It might have sunk like a lackadaisical feather to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where even the most gigantic structures; ceilings and obdurate iron; perennially floated around as invincibly aristocratic silk, 

It might have sunk like a lifeless corpse to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where the flaming Sun played hide-n-seek till eternity; as nubile couples mischievously cavorted up and down the numerous rails and decks, 

It might have sunk like a cadaverously hammered bone to the rock bottom of
the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where there was nothing else to do; but interminably dream; dream and simply and majestically dream, 

It might have sunk like despondently distorted pulp to the rock bottom of the ocean; but I for one would forever remember the Titanic as a ship; where there everlastingly throbbed the heartbeat of immortal love; between "Jack" and "Rose"; irrespective of whether the physical forms stayed or crumbled; irrespective of whether there prevailed life or hopeless death. 

Fear of Darkness, 
sick of light, 
my easy way out in sight, 
go on let it take you.  never, 
withdrawing my hand from which it desires, 
thoughts and scars is all it requires
Need some help but no one there, 
do i give up or stay here? 

I feel a love surrounding my heart, 
a reason to make a new start? 
im scared he'd run, 
but what would i do, 
Hold my breathe till my face goes blue? 

I hold my thoughts in my head, 
as i lay curled up on my bed.
waiting for voices to come flooding back, 
eats my self confidance in which i lack

I run to my grandad in that heaven, 
i pictured myself when i was  
playing in the field remembering him 
whispering in my ear, i love you Kim.
i'd turn to him with a smile, 
My boyfriend makes my life worth while, 
he looks down and sees me laugh, 
but what have i chosen for my future path? 
Its up to you which one you choose, 
either way you can win or loose.  

LILLE, Sept.  

My heart is weary, my peace is gone,
How shall I e'er my woes reveal?
I have no money, I lie in pawn,
A stranger in the town of Lille.

I.

With twenty pounds but three weeks since
From Paris forth did Titmarsh wheel,
I thought myself as rich a prince
As beggar poor I'm now at Lille.

Confiding in my ample means—
In troth, I was a happy chiel!
I passed the gates of Valenciennes,
I never thought to come by Lille.

I never thought my twenty pounds
Some rascal knave would dare to steal;
I gayly passed the Belgic bounds
At Quievrain, twenty miles from Lille.

To Antwerp town I hasten'd post,
And as I took my evening meal
I felt my pouch,—my purse was lost,
O Heaven! Why came I not by Lille?

I straightway called for ink and pen,
To grandmamma I made appeal;
Meanwhile a loan of guineas ten
I borrowed from a friend so leal.

I got the cash from grandmamma
(Her gentle heart my woes could feel,)
But where I went, and what I saw,
What matters? Here I am at Lille.

My heart is weary, my peace is gone,
How shall I e'er my woes reveal?
I have no cash, I lie in pawn,
A stranger in the town of Lille.

II.

To stealing I can never come,
To pawn my watch I'm too genteel,
Besides, I left my watch at home,
How could I pawn it then at Lille?

'La note,' at times the guests will say.
I turn as white as cold boil'd veal;
I turn and look another way,
I dare not ask the bill at Lille.

I dare not to the landlord say,
'Good sir, I cannot pay your bill;'
And is quite proud I stay at Lille.

Like Rothschild or Sir Robert Peel,
And so he serves me every day
The best of meat and drink in Lille.

Yet when he looks me in the face
I blush as red as cochineal;
And think did he but know my case,
How changed he'd be, my host of Lille.

My heart is weary, my peace is gone,
How shall I e'er my woes reveal?
I have no money, I lie in pawn,
A stranger in the town of Lille.

III.

The sun bursts out in furious blaze,
I perspirate from head to heel;
I'd like to hire a one-horse chaise,
How can I, without cash at Lille?

I pass in sunshine burning hot
By cafes where in beer they deal;
I think how pleasant were a pot,
A frothing pot of beer of Lille!

What is yon house with walls so thick,
All girt around with guard and grille?
O gracious gods! it makes me sick,
It is the PRISON-HOUSE of Lille!

O cursed prison strong and barred,
It does my very blood congeal!
I tremble as I pass the guard,
And quit that ugly part of Lille.

The church-door beggar whines and prays,
I turn away at his appeal
Ah, church-door beggar! go thy ways!
You're not the poorest man in Lille.

My heart is weary, my peace is gone,
How shall I e'er any woes reveal?
I have no money, I lie in pawn,
A stranger in the town of Lille.

IV.

Say, shall I to you Flemish church,
And at a Popish altar kneel?
Oh, do not leave me in the lurch,—
I'll cry, ye patron-saints of Lille!

Ye virgins dressed in satin hoops,
Ye martyrs slain for mortal weal,
Look kindly down! before you stoops
The miserablest man in Lille.

And lo! as I beheld with awe
A pictured saint (I swear 'tis real),
It smiled, and turned to grandmamma!—
It did! and I had hope in Lille!

'Twas five o'clock, and I could eat,
Although I could not pay my meal:
I hasten back into the street
Where lies my inn, the best Lille.

What see I on my table stand,—
A letter with a well-known seal?
'Tis grandmamma's! I know her hand,—
'To Mr. M. A. Titmarsh, Lille.'

I feel a choking in my throat,
I pant and stagger, faint and reel!
It is—it is—a ten-pound note,
And I'm no more in pawn at Lille!


[He goes off by the diligence that evening, and is restored to the
bosom of his happy family.]The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see
        The wantonest singing birds,
      Are lips- and all thy melody
        Of lip-begotten words-

      Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined,
        Then desolately fall,
        Like starlight on a pall-

     Thy heart- thy heart!- I wake and sigh,
        And sleep to dream till day
      Of the truth that gold can never buy-
        Of the baubles that it may. 

Hadst thou liv'd in days of old, 
O what wonders had been told 
Of thy lively countenance, 
And thy humid eyes that dance 
In the midst of their own brightness; 
In the very fane of lightness. 
Over which thine eyebrows, leaning, 
Picture out each lovely meaning: 
In a dainty bend they lie, 
Like to streaks across the sky, 
Or the feathers from a crow, 
Fallen on a bed of snow. 
Of thy dark hair that extends 
Into many graceful bends: 
As the leaves of Hellebore 
Turn to whence they sprung before. 
And behind each ample curl 
Peeps the richness of a pearl. 
Downward too flows many a tress 
With a glossy waviness; 
Full, and round like globes that rise 
From the censer to the skies 
Through sunny air. Add too, the sweetness 
Of thy honied voice; the neatness 
Of thine ankle lightly turn'd: 
With those beauties, scarce discern'd, 
Kept with such sweet privacy, 
That they seldom meet the eye 
Of the little loves that fly 
Round about with eager pry. 
Saving when, with freshening lave, 
Thou dipp'st them in the taintless wave; 
Like twin water lillies, born 
In the coolness of the morn. 
O, if thou hadst breathed then, 
Now the Muses had been ten. 
Couldst thou wish for lineage higher 
Than twin sister of Thalia? 
At least for ever, evermore, 
Will I call the Graces four. 

Hadst thou liv'd when chivalry 
Lifted up her lance on high, 
Tell me what thou wouldst have been? 
Ah! I see the silver sheen 
Of thy broidered, floating vest 
Cov’ring half thine ivory breast; 
Which, O heavens! I should see, 
But that cruel destiny 
Has placed a golden cuirass there; 
Keeping secret what is fair. 
Like sunbeams in a cloudlet nested 
Thy locks in knightly casque are rested: 
O’er which bend four milky plumes 
Like the gentle lilly’s blooms 
Springing from a costly vase. 
See with what a stately pace 
Comes thine alabaster steed; 
Servant of heroic deed! 
O'er his loins, his trappings glow 
Like the northern lights on snow. 
Mount his back! thy sword unsheath! 
Sign of the enchanter's death; 
Bane of every wicked spell; 
Silencer of dragon's yell. 
Alas! thou this wilt never do: 
Thou art an enchantress too, 
And wilt surely never spill 
Blood of those whose eyes can kill. 

Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
      In the mad pride of intellectuality,
      Maintained "the power of words"- denied that ever
      A thought arose within the human brain
      Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
      And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
      Two words- two foreign soft dissyllables-
      Italian tones, made only to be murmured
      By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew
      That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,"
      Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
      Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
      Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
      Than even seraph harper, Israfel,
      Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
      The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
      With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee,
      I cannot write- I cannot speak or think-
      Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
      This standing motionless upon the golden
      Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams.
      Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
      And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
      Upon the left, and all the way along,
      Amid empurpled vapors, far away
      To where the prospect terminates- thee only. 

I remember the marvellous moment
you appeared before me,
like a transient vision,
like pure beauty’s spirit.
 
Lost in hopeless sadness,
lost in the loud world’s turmoil,
I heard your voice’s echo,
and often dreamed your features.
 
Years passed. The storm winds scattered,
with turbulent gusts, that dreaming.
I forgot your voice, its tenderness.
I forgot your lovely face.
 
Remote in my darkened exile,
the days dragged by so slowly,
without grace, without inspiration,
without life, without tears, without love.
 
Then my spirit woke
and you, you appeared again,
like a transient vision,
like pure beauty’s spirit.
 
And my heart beats with delight,
and ecstasy, inside me,
and grace and inspiration,
and tears, and life, and love.
Think not of it, sweet one, so;--
Give it not a tear;
Sigh thou mayst, and bid it go
Any, any where.


Do not look so sad, sweet one,--
Sad and fadingly;
Shed one drop then, it is gone,
O 'twas born to die!


Still so pale? then, dearest, weep;
Weep, I'll count the tears,
And each one shall be a bliss
For thee in after years.


Brighter has it left thine eyes
Than a sunny rill;
And thy whispering melodies
Are tenderer still.


Yet -- as all things mourn awhile
At fleeting blisses,
E'en let us too! but be our dirge
A dirge of kisses. 

The Day was dying; his breath
Wavered away in a hectic gleam;
And I said, if Life's a dream, and Death
And Love and all are dreams -- I'll dream.

 A mist came over the bay
Like as a dream would over an eye.
The mist was white and the dream was grey
And both contained a human cry,

 The burthen whereof was "Love",
And it filled both mist and dream with pain,
And the hills below and the skies above
Were touched and uttered it back again.

 The mist broke:  down the rift
A kind ray shot from a holy star.
Then my dream did waver and break and lift --
Through it, O Love, shone thy face, afar.

 So Boyhood sets:  comes Youth,
A painful night of mists and dreams;
That broods till Love's exquisite truth,
The star of a morn-clear manhood, beams.(For Kenton) 

An iron hand has stilled the throats
 That throbbed with loud and rhythmic glee
And dammed the flood of silver notes
 That drenched the world in melody.
The blosmy apple boughs are yearning
For their wild choristers' returning,
 But no swift wings flash through the tree. 

Ye that were glad and fleet and strong,
 Shall Silence take you in her net?
And shall Death quell that radiant song
 Whose echo thrills the meadow yet?
Burst the frail web about you clinging
And charm Death's cruel heart with singing
 Till with strange tears his eyes are wet. 

The scented morning of the year
 Is old and stale now ye are gone.
No friendly songs the children hear
 Among the bushes on the lawn.
When babies wander out a-Maying
Will ye, their bards, afar be straying?
 Unhymned by you, what is the dawn? 

Nay, since ye loved ye cannot die.
 Above the stars is set your nest.
Through Heaven's fields ye sing and fly
 And in the trees of Heaven rest.
And little children in their dreaming
Shall see your soft black plumage gleaming
 And smile, by your clear music blest. 

That brown girl's swagger gives a twitch
Lad, never damn your body's itch
When loveliness is seen.

For there is ample room for bliss
In pride in clean brown limbs,
And lips know better how to kiss
Than how to raise white hymns.

And when your body's death gives birth
To soil for spring to crown,
Men will not ask if that rare earth
Was white flesh once, or brown. 

LORD BUDDHA, on thy Lotus-throne, 
With praying eyes and hands elate, 
What mystic rapture dost thou own, 
Immutable and ultimate? 
What peace, unravished of our ken, 
Annihilate from the world of men? 

The wind of change for ever blows 
Across the tumult of our way, 
To-morrow's unborn griefs depose 
The sorrows of our yesterday. 
Dream yields to dream, strife follows strife, 
And Death unweaves the webs of Life.

For us the travail and the heat, 
The broken secrets of our pride, 
The strenuous lessons of defeat, 
The flower deferred, the fruit denied; 
But not the peace, supremely won, 

With futile hands we seek to gain 
Our inaccessible desire, 
Diviner summits to attain, 
With faith that sinks and feet that tire; 
But nought shall conquer or control 
The heavenward hunger of our soul. 

The end, elusive and afar, 
Still lures us with its beckoning flight, 
And all our mortal moments are 
A session of the Infinite. 
How shall we reach the great, unknown 
Nirvana of thy Lotus-throne

We held the book together timidly, 
Whose antique music in an alien tongue 
Once rose among the dew-drenched vines that hung 
Beneath a high Castilian balcony. 
I felt the lute strings' ancient ecstasy, 
And while he read, my love-filled heart was stung, 
And throbbed, as where an ardent bird has clung 
The branches tremble on a blossomed tree. 
Oh lady for whose sake the song was made, 
Laid long ago in some still cypress shade, 
Divided from the man who longed for thee, 
Here in a land whose name he never heard, 
His song brought love as April brings the bird, 
And not a breath divides my love from me

The greatest poem ever known 
Is one all poets have outgrown: 
The poetry, innate, untold, 
Of being only four years old.

Still young enough to be a part 
Of Nature's great impulsive heart, 
Born comrade of bird, beast, and tree 
And unselfconscious as the bee-

And yet with lovely reason skilled 
Each day new paradise to build; 
Elate explorer of each sense, 
Without dismay, without pretense!

In your unstained transparent eyes 
There is no conscience, no surprise: 
Life's queer conundrums you accept, 
Your strange divinity still kept.

Being, that now absorbs you, all 
Harmonious, unit, integral, 
Will shred into perplexing bits,- 
Oh, contradictions of the wits!

And Life, that sets all things in rhyme, 
may make you poet, too, in time- 
But there were days, O tender elf, 
When you were Poetry itself

DANCE there upon the shore;
What need have you to care
For wind or water's roar?
And tumble out your hair
That the salt drops have wet;
Being young you have not known
The fool's triumph, nor yet
Love lost as soon as won,
Nor the best labourer dead
And all the sheaves to bind.
What need have you to dread
The monstrous crying of wind

LORDS, knights, and squires, the numerous band 
   That wear the fair Miss Mary's fetters, 
Were summoned by her high command 
   To show their passions by their letters. 

My pen amongst the rest I took, 
   Lest those bright eyes, that cannot read, 
Should dart their kindling fire, and look 
   The power they have to be obey'd. 

Nor quality, nor reputation, 
   Forbid me yet my flame to tell; 
Dear Five-years-old befriends my passion, 
   And I may write till she can spell. 

For, while she makes her silkworms beds 
   With all the tender things I swear; 
Whilst all the house my passion reads, 
   In papers round her baby's hair; 

She may receive and own my flame; 
   For, though the strictest prudes should know it, 
She'll pass for a most virtuous dame, 
   And I for an unhappy poet. 

Then too, alas! when she shall tear 
   The rhymes some younger rival sends, 
She'll give me leave to write, I fear, 
   And we shall still continue friends. 

For, as our different ages move, 
   'Tis so ordain'd (would Fate but mend it!), 
That I shall be past making love 
   When she begins to comprehend it.

WHERE contemplation finds her sacred spring,
Where heav'nly music makes the arches ring,
Where virtue reigns unsully'd and divine,
Where wisdom thron'd, and all the graces shine,
There sits thy spouse amidst the radiant throng,
While praise eternal warbles from her tongue;
There choirs angelic shout her welcome round,
With perfect bliss, and peerless glory crown'd.
  While thy dear mate, to flesh no more confin'd,
Exults a blest, an heav n-ascended mind,
Say in thy breast shall floods of sorrow rise?
Say shall its torrents overwhelm thine eyes?
Amid the seats of heav'n a place is free,
And angels open their bright ranks for thee;
For thee they wait, and with expectant eye
Thy spouse leans downward from th' empyreal sky:
"O come away," her longing spirit cries,
"And share with me the raptures of the skies.
"Our bliss divine to mortals is unknown;
"Immortal life and glory are our own.
"There too may the dear pledges of our love
"Arrive, and taste with us the joys above;
"Attune the harp to more than mortal lays,
"And join with us the tribute of their praise
"To him, who dy'd stern justice to stone,
"And make eternal glory all our own.
"He in his death slew ours, and, as he rose,
"He crush'd the dire dominion of our foes;
"Chain us to hell, and bar the gates of light

"
  She spoke, and turn'd from mortal scenes her eyes,
Which beam'd celestial radiance o'er the skies.
  Then thou dear man, no more with grief retire,
Let grief no longer damp devotion's fire,
But rise sublime, to equal bliss aspire,
Thy sighs no more be wafted by the wind,
No more complain, but be to heav'n resign'd
'Twas thine t' unfold the oracles divine,
To sooth our woes the task was also thine;
Now sorrow is incumbent on thy heart,
Permit the muse a cordial to impart;
Who can to thee their tend'rest aid refuse?
To dry thy tears how longs the heav'nly muse

Beautiful cloud! with folds so soft and fair,
Swimming in the pure quiet air!
Thy fleeces bathed in sunlight, while below
Thy shadow o'er the vale moves slow;
Where, midst their labour, pause the reaper train
As cool it comes along the grain.
Beautiful cloud! I would I were with thee
In thy calm way o'er land and sea:
To rest on thy unrolling skirts, and look
On Earth as on an open book;
On streams that tie her realms with silver bands,
And the long ways that seam her lands;
And hear her humming cities, and the sound
Of the great ocean breaking round.
Ay--I would sail upon thy air-borne car
To blooming regions distant far,
To where the sun of Andalusia shines
On his own olive-groves and vines,
Or the soft lights of Italy's bright sky
In smiles upon her ruins lie.
But I would woo the winds to let us rest
O'er Greece long fettered and oppressed,

Whose sons at length have heard the call that comes
From the old battle-fields and tombs,
And risen, and drawn the sword, and on the foe
Have dealt the swift and desperate blow,
And the Othman power is cloven, and the stroke
Has touched its chains, and they are broke.
Ay, we would linger till the sunset there
Should come, to purple all the air,
And thou reflect upon the sacred ground
The ruddy radiance streaming round.

Bright meteor! for the summer noontide made!
Thy peerless beauty yet shall fade.
The sun, that fills with light each glistening fold,
Shall set, and leave thee dark and cold:
The blast shall rend thy skirts, or thou may'st frown
In the dark heaven when storms come down,
And weep in rain, till man's inquiring eye
Miss thee, forever from the sky. 

You come along. . . tearing your shirt. . . yelling about
     Where do you get that stuff?

     he never made any fake passes and everything
     he said went and he helped the sick and gave the
     people hope.


You come along squirting words at us, shaking your fist
     and calling us all damn fools so fierce the froth slobbers
     over your lips. . . always blabbing we're all
     going to hell straight off and you know all about it.


     throw any scare into me. I've got your number. I
He never came near clean people or dirty people but
     they felt cleaner because he came along. It was your
     crowd of bankers and business men and lawyers
     of the running.


I say the same bunch backing you nailed the nails into
     up against him the same crooks and strong-arm men
     now lined up with you paying your way.

     good. He threw out something fresh and beautiful
     from the skin of his body and the touch of his hands
     wherever he passed along.
You slimy bunkshooter, you put a smut on every human
     blossom in reach of your rotten breath belching
     about hell-fire and hiccupping about this Man who
     lived a clean life in Galilee.

When are you going to quit making the carpenters build
     emergency hospitals for women and girls driven
     crazy with wrecked nerves from your gibberish about


Go ahead and bust all the chairs you want to. Smash
     a whole wagon load of furniture at every performance.
     Turn sixty somersaults and stand on your
     nutty head. If it wasn't for the way you scare the
     women and kids I'd feel sorry for you and pass the hat.
I like to watch a good four-flusher work, but not when
I like a man that's got nerve and can pull off a great
     original performance, but you--you're only a bug-
     house peddler of second-hand gospel--you're only
     shoving out a phoney imitation of the goods this

     up all right with them by giving them mansions in

     eaten 'em.
You tell $a week department store girls all they need

You tell poor people they don't need any more money

     and lawyers of Jerusalem got their sluggers and
     wouldn't play their game. He didn't sit in with
     the big thieves.

I don't want a lot of gab from a bunkshooter in my religion.
I won't take my religion from any man who never works
     except with his mouth and never cherishes any memory
     except the face of the woman on the American
     silver dollar.

I ask you to come through and show me where you're
     pouring out the blood of your life.

I've been to this suburb of Jerusalem they call Golgotha,
     where they nailed Him, and I know if the story is
     straight it was real blood ran from His hands and
     the nail-holes, and it was real blood spurted in red
     drops where the spear of the Roman soldier rammed

To a critic 

Often pours spite; 
On poem’s artistry, 
Best effort despite, 
Never stops to criticize, 
Out to persecute, 
Out to assail, 
Out to destroy creativity, 
Lives in narrow human doctrines, 
Fails to distinguish 
Vice from virtue, 
Let his performance 
Prove his critic’s artistry, 
Drops words like 
This is a poem I don’t like, 
Kind of a bummer, 
Whimsical and scary, 
Cerebral about things he hates, 
But emotive about things he loves, 
This could have been better, 
Why better, 
Could have been the best I say, 
I have done the best, 
Within my capacity, 
And you could do best of best, 
Beyond my capacity, 
The wonders of which, 
The world has never seen, 
But be constructive, 
I hope and wish, 
That you fare well, 
And that proves 
To be rare and divine.  .. 

you are the one
i am lit for.
Come with your rod
that twists
and is a serpent.
i am the bush.
i am burning
i am not consumed. 

When I taught you
at eight to ride
a bicycle, loping along
beside you
as you wobbled away
on two round wheels,
my own mouth rounding
in surprise when you pulled
ahead down the curved
path of the park,
I kept waiting
for the thud
of your crash as I
sprinted to catch up,
while you grew
smaller, more breakable
with distance,
pumping, pumping
for your life, screaming
with laughter,
the hair flapping
behind you like a
handkerchief waving
goodbye. 

The dark is thrown 
Back from the brightness, like hair 
Cast over a shoulder. 
I am alone, 

Four years older; 
Like the chairs and the walls 
Which I once watched brighten 
With you beside me. I was to waken 
Never like this, whatever came or was taken. 

The stalk grows, the year beats on the wind. 
Apples come, and the month for their fall. 
The bark spreads, the roots tighten. 
Though today be the last 
Or tomorrow all, 
You will not mind. 

That I may not remember 
Does not matter. 
I shall not be with you again. 
What we knew, even now 
Must scatter 
And be ruined, and blow 
Like dust in the rain. 

You have been dead a long season 
And have less than desire 
Who were lover with lover; 
And I have life—that old reason 
To wait for what comes, 
To leave what is over. 

Over the dead line we have called to you
To come across with a word to us,
Some beaten whisper of what happens
Where you are over the dead line
Deaf to our calls and voiceless.

The flickering shadows have not answered
Nor your lips sent a signal
Whether love talks and roses grow
And the sun breaks at morning
Splattering the sea with crimson. 

When I laid aside the verses of Mimnermus, 
I lived a life of canned heat and raw hands, 
alone, not far from my body did I wander, 
walked with a hope of a sudden dreamy forest of gold.
O rose, downfallen, bend your huge vegetic back; 
eye down the imposter sun.  

in winter dream
sulk your rosefamed head into the bile of golden giant, 
ah, rose, augment the rose further still! 
whence upon that self-created dive in Eden
you blossomed where the Watchmaker of Nothingness
         lulled, 
your birth did cause bits of smashed night to pop, 
causing my dreamy forest to unfold.
Yes, and the Watchmaker, his wheely-flesh
and jewelled-bones spoiled as he awoke, 
and in the face of your Somethingness, he fled
waving oblivious monks in his unwinded hands.
The sun cannot see upheaved spatics, the tennis of Venus
and the court of Mars sing the big lie of the sun, 
ah, faraway ball of fur, sponge up the elements; 
make clear the trees and the mountains of the earth, 
arise and turn away from the vast fixedness.

Rose! Rose! my tinhorneared rose! 
Rose is my visionic eyehand of all Mysticdom
Rose is my wise chair of bombed houses
Rose is my patient electric eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, 
Rose is my festive jowl, 
Dali Lama Grand Vicar Glorious Caesar rose! 

When I hear the rose scream
I gather all the failure experiments of an anatomical empire
and, with some chemical dream, discover
the hateful law of the earth and sun, and the screaming 
         rose between. 

Reveal yourself, anonymous enchanter!
What heaven hastens you to me?
Why draw me to that promised land again
That I gave up so long ago?

Was it not you who in my youth
Enchanted me with such sweet dreams,
Did you not whisper, long ago,
Dear hopes of a guests ethereal?

Was it not you through whom all lived
In golden days, in happy lands
Of fragrant meadows, waters bright,
Where days were merry 

neath clear skies?

Was it not you who breathed into my vernal breast 
Some melancholy mysteries
Tormenting it with keen desire 
Exciting it to anxious joy?

Was it not you who bore my soul aloft
Upon the inspiration of your sacred verse,
Who flamed before me like a holy vision,
Initiating me into life's beauty?

In hours lost, hours of secret grief,
Did you not always murmur to my heart,
With happy comfort soothe it
And nurture it with quiet hope?

Did not my soul forever heed you
In all the purest moments of my life
When'ere it glimpsed fate's sacred essence

What news bring you, O, my enchantress?
Or will you once more call in dreams
Awaken futile thoughts of old,
Whisper of joy and then fall silent?

O spirit, bide with me awhile;
O, faithful friend, haste not away;
Stay, please become my earthly life,
O, Guardian angel of my soul.


К мимопро летевше му знакомо му гению

С ;кажи, кто ты, плените ль безымян ный?
С каких небес примчал ся ты ко мне?
Зач м опять влечешь к обетова нной,
Да но, давно покинут ой стране?

Не ты ли тот, который жизнь младую
 ак сладост но мечтами усыплял 
И в старину про гостью неземну ю -
Про милую надежду ей шептал?

Не ты ли тот, кем все во дни прекрас ны
Так жило там, в счастли вых тех краях,
Г е луг душист, где воды светло-я ;сны,
Где весел день на чистых небесах ?

Не ты ль во грудь с живым весны дыханье м
Таинс венной унылост ью влетал,
 е теснил томител ьным желанье м
И трепетн ым веселье м волнова л?

Поэзl и священн ым вдохнов еньем
Н  ты ль с душой носился в высоту,
 ред ней горел божеств енным виденье м,
Разоб ачал ей жизни красоту ?

В часы утрат, в часы печали тайной,
 е ты ль всегда беседой сердца был,
Его смирял утехою случайн ой
И тихою надеждо ю целил?

h  не тебе ль всегда она внимала 
В чистейш ие минуты бытия,
К гда судьбы святыню постига ла,
Когд  лишь Бог свидете ль был ея?

Какm ю ж весть принес ты, мой плените ль?
Или опять мечтой лишь поманиш ь
И, прежних дум напрасн ый пробуди тель,
О счастии шепнешь и замолчи шь?

О Гений мой, побудь еще со мною;
Бы алый друг, отлетом не спеши;
О танься, будь мне жизнию земною,
 удь ангелом -храните ;лем души. 

Well, Lizzie Anderson! seventeen men--and 
the baby hard to find a father for! 

What will the good Father in Heaven say 
to the local judge if he do not solve this problem? 
A little two-pointed smile and--pouff!-- 
the law is changed into a mouthful of phrases. 

To a friend-- - - - - - - - - - -  
Not only am I made
Of flesh and bone
But also made
Bagful of emotions
Joy in spring
Sorrow autumn brings
Love a perennial season
Can outshine sun and moon
A pleasant heaven, yet I fear
Your spite and airs uglier
Than anything else
Pulling us
Apart into hell
That you care not to quell 
Oh my dear friend, 
See how leaves are falling on the ground
Untimely and not yet browned
Yet you say everything is going good
And in the masque of seasons
Nothing is enduring even
Love had had its share
Leaves its rapture
And thou heart thy summer
But so much have I to say ere
You go your way
You go your way--I ask but one thing of you, only one, 
That always you will be my dream of you; 
That never shall I wake to find untrue 
All this I have believed and rested on, 
Forever vanished, like a vision gone 
Out into the night. Alas, how few 
There are who strike in us a chord we knew 
Existed, but so seldom heard its tone 
We tremble at the half-forgotten sound. 
The world is full of rude awakenings 
And heaven-born castles shattered to the ground, 
Yet still our human longing vainly clings 
To a belief in beauty through all wrongs. 
O stay your hand, and leave my heart its songs

Go, then, and join the murmuring city's throng! 
Me thou dost leave to solitude and tears; 
To busy phantasies, and boding fears, 
Lest ill betide thee; but 't will not be long 
Ere the hard season shall be past; till then 
Live happy; sometimes the forsaken shade 
Remembering, and these trees now left to fade; 
Nor, mid the busy scenes and hum of men, 
Wilt thou my cares forget: in heaviness 
To me the hours shall roll, weary and slow, 
Till mournful autumn past, and all the snow 
Of winter pale, the glad hour I shall bless 
That shall restore thee from the crowd again, 
To the green hamlet on the peaceful plain. 

To a friend 

You were in trouble; 
Blind was the whole world, 
Turning a deaf ear too, 
Looked crushed and shattered, 
Almost on the verge of death, 
None but poverty with you, 
With suspicion, everyone looking you, 
As if you were from a different world, 
Melted down my heart, 
I was in tears, 
Vowed to assist you, 
And see you revived, 
Happy to see a soul saved 
From disgrace and near death, 
Now my millionaire friend, 
Time has come to repay your debts, 
The little money I helped you, 
Was my life’s total asset 
I request you to back me in earnest, 
You listen and go silent, 
Bearing no fruits on repeated requests, 
Perhaps you thrive and go easy, 
Because of my non-reacts, 
Wish you thrive to such a height, 
That when you fall, you feel light, 
And in my suffering, if you prosper, 
To judge it free and fair, 
Happy to see a soul saved 
From disgrace and near death 
My friend, my dear.  .. 

Just wanted to appreciate 

To one whom I've never met 

Gratefulness  and appreciations  for his pure soul 

For those kind words which gave me a push to continue my hard road 

How admirable how he has got my woes 

From other side of the world

A stranger felt it all 

Though the ones  who were near

 A lifetime were here  

Their shadows still i can feel 

And smell the passion 

Yearning to past yrars

Unfortunately like a wind they've disappeared 

Those who were by my next door thousands years

For the kind words and your care 

For giving me the hope when my soul was absolutely bare

When already I've  understood the existence  of humanity has became so rare 

For asking me about my fear

In the world of war here

Nights are so long darkness surrounds  frozen tears
Shivering souls cradling in woes 

Among fires weapons and bombs 

Four years of war

Took away from me a lot  

Hard to be told 

Here is the world of war 

The world of poverty  and death 

Insatiable devil gazes around  his
hands stained with the blood of innocent child's
And who's turn now? 

While  every nigh  me and mom

Used to hag each other like its last one  

Tight and long ah my poor mom 

My only light through the dark, cold  night

I kiss her precious frozen hands 

With prayers we both wish each other with smiling face 

Peaceful night mom 

Its may last goodbye

Who knows may tomorrow never comes

I sighed: 
He died.
He had a million dollar job, 
I sobbed.
He had tenure.
He had good pasture.
He died.
He was a good man, 
A special person
That you can
Easily be a great fan
Of.
He showed a lot of love
When you talked to this
Son
Of a gun.
He was a fun
Guy. You could talk
And walk with him
After the A. 

C. Convention.
I always had a special vision 
Of him.
Because he was different, 
He was a great family man.

Good health
Is more important
Than great wealth.
Money is there to be spent
And money cannot buy heaven
And the eternal life.
He had a great wife.
A great job, 
I sobbed.
I sighed, 
He died
Abruptly, 
Suddenly
Without saying good bye.
He had everything, 
Except one thing: 
Eternity.
This is a pity! 
He left eveything behind.
He was a man of a great mind, 
He left with that too.
He was among  a few
Good gentlemen left on this planet, 
He disappeared in the sunset.
The world will forever miss this good man.
He was not a good friend, 
Nevertheless, he was a friend, 
A brother and a gentleman.


You know there is not much 
that I desire, a few chrysanthemums 
half lying on the grass, yellow 
and brown and white, the 
talk of a few people, the trees, 
an expanse of dried leaves perhaps 
with ditches among them. 

But there comes 
between me and these things 
a letter 
or even a look--well placed, 
you understand, 
so that I am confused, twisted 
four ways and--left flat, 
unable to lift the food to 
my own mouth: 
Here is what they say: Come! 
and come! and come! And if 
I do not go I remain stale to 
myself and if I go-- 
I have watched 
the city from a distance at night 
and wondered why I wrote no poem. 
Come! yes, 
the city is ablaze for you 
and you stand and look at it. 

And they are right. There is 
no good in the world except out of 
a woman and certain women alone 
for certain. But what if 
I arrive like a turtle, 
with my house on my back or 
a fish ogling from under water? 
It will not do. I must be 
steaming with love, colored 
like a flamingo. For what? 
To have legs and a silly head 
and to smell, pah! like a flamingo 
that soils its own feathers behind. 
Must I go home filled 
with a bad poem? 
And they say: 
Who can answer these things 
till he has tried? Your eyes 
are half closed, you are a child, 
oh, a sweet one, ready to play 
but I will make a man of you and 
with love on his shoulder--! 

And in the marshes 
the crickets run 
on the sunny dike's top and 
make burrows there, the water 
reflects the reeds and the reeds 
move on their stalks and rattle drily. 

Today, because I couldn't find the shortcut through,
I had to walk this town's entire inner
perimeter to find
where the medieval walls break open
in an eighteenth century
arch. The yellow valley flickered on and off
through cracks and the gaps
for guns. Bruna is teaching me
to cut a pattern.
Saturdays we buy the cloth.
She takes it in her hands
like a good idea, feeling
for texture, grain, the built-in 
limits. It's only as an afterthought she asks
and do you think it's beautiful?
Her measuring tapes hang down, corn-blond and endless,
from her neck.
When I look at her
I think Rapunzel,
how one could climb that measuring,
that love. But I was saying,
I wandered all along the street that hugs the walls,
a needle floating
on its cloth. Once
I shut my eyes and felt my way
along the stone. Outside
is the cashcrop, sunflowers, as far as one can see. Listen,
the wind rattles in them,
a loose worship
seeking an object,
an interruption. Sara,
the walls are beautiful. They block the view.
And it feels rich to be
inside their grasp.
When Bruna finishes her dress
it is the shape of what has come
to rescue her. She puts it on. 


NOW all the truth is out,
Be secret and take defeat
From any brazen throat,
For how can you compete,
Being honour bred, with one
Who, were it proved he lies,
Were neither shamed in his own
Nor in his neighbours' eyes?
Bred to a harder thing
Than Triumph, turn away
And like a laughing string
Whereon mad fingers play
Amid a place of stone,
Be secret and exult,
Because of all things known
That is most difficult. 


ON Death's domain intent I fix my eyes,
Where human nature in vast ruin lies:
With pensive mind I search the drear abode,
Where the great conqu'ror has his spoils bestow'd;
There there the offspring of six thousand years
In endless numbers to my view appears:
Whole kingdoms in his gloomy den are thrust,
And nations mix with their primeval dust:
Insatiate still he gluts the ample tomb;
His is the present, his the age to come.
See here a brother, here a sister spread,
And a sweet daughter mingled with the dead.
  But, Madam, let your grief be laid aside,
And let the fountain of your tears be dry'd,
In vain they flow to wet the dusty plain,
Your sighs are wafted to the skies in vain,
Your pains they witness, but they can no more,
While Death reigns tyrant o'er this mortal shore.
At last must perish in the gloom of night:
Resign thy friends to that Almighty hand,
Which gave them life, and bow to his command;
Thine Avis give without a murm'ring heart,
Though half thy soul be fated to depart.
To shining guards consign thine infant care
To waft triumphant through the seas of air:
Her soul enlarg'd to heav'nly pleasure springs,
She feeds on truth and uncreated things.
Methinks I hear her in the realms above,
And leaning forward with a filial love,
Invite you there to share immortal bliss
Unknown, untasted in a state like this.
With tow'ring hopes, and growing grace arise,
And seek beatitude beyond the skies. 

WHILE others chant of gay Elysian scenes,
Of balmy zephyrs, and of flow'ry plains,
My song more happy speaks a greater name,
Feels higher motives and a nobler flame.
For thee, O R-----, the muse attunes her strings,
And mounts sublime above inferior things.
  I sing not now of green embow'ring woods,
I sing not now the daughters of the floods,
I sing not of the storms o'er ocean driv'n,
And how they howl'd along the waste of heav'n.
But I to R----- would paint the British shore,
And vast Atlantic, not untry'd before:
Thy life impair'd commands thee to arise,
Leave these bleak regions and inclement skies,
Where chilling winds return the winter past,
And nature shudders at the furious blast.
  O thou stupendous, earth-enclosing main
Exert thy wonders to the world again!
If ere thy pow'r prolong'd the fleeting breath,
Turn'd back the shafts, and mock'd the gates of death,
If ere thine air dispens'd an healing pow'r,
Or snatch'd the victim from the fatal hour,
This equal case demands thine equal care,
And equal wonders may this patient share.
But unavailing, frantic is the dream
To hope thine aid without the aid of him
Who gave thee birth and taught thee where to flow,
And in thy waves his various blessings show.
  May R----- return to view his native shore
Replete with vigour not his own before,
Then shall we see with pleasure and surprise,
And own thy work, great Ruler of the skies



Every -body is somebody  
Don't dare forget it  
Make yourself fit it  You may have to grow some  
In spirit, you can do it  
Then follow on through it  When disappointments come  
as they most always or  
The way that you take them  
Will tell things about you  Folks with swelled heads  
Become unbalanced and fall  
Fret solidly planted  
Stumble not much at all. 

I yearn to show you, praise you, to the world -
-and straightway hear you: 'Inappropriate. '; 
said with firm authority, and yet
said kindly, smiling, thoughtful; as if part
of some continued talk about the truth; 

and as I, listening, look at you, I catch
in that sharp-seeing eye, the spark of joy; 
and at the corners of your mouth, the twitch
of heavenly laughter at the comedy -
the serious humour - of our earthly wealth; 
Shakespeare knew your sort: a golden girl
who brings to men and women their true self.

The more we loved the beauty of your mind, 
the more that presence ever now we find


This is to the crown and blessing of my life,
The much loved husband of a happy wife;
To him whose constant passion found the art
To win a stubborn and ungrateful heart,
And to the world by tenderest proof discovers
They err, who say that husbands can't be lovers.
With such return of passion, as is due,
Daphnis I love, Daphinis my thoughts pursue;
Daphnis, my hopes and joys are bounded all in you.
Even I, for Daphnis' and my promise' sake,
What I in woman censure, undertake.
But this from love, not vanity proceeds;
You know who writes, and I who 'tis that reads.
Judge not my passion by my want of skill:
Many love well, though they express it ill;
And I your censure could with pleasure bear,
Would you but soon return, and speak it here. 

Brighter than fireflies upon the Uji River 
Are your words in the dark, Beloved. 

Humid seal of soft affections,
     Tend'rest pledge of future bliss,
Dearest tie of young connections,
     Love's first snow-drop, virgin kiss.

Speaking silence, dumb confession,
     Passion's birth, and infants' play,
Dove-like fondness, chaste concession,
     Glowing dawn of brighter day.

Sorrowing joy, adieu's last action,
     Ling'ring lips, -- no more to join!
What words can ever speak affection
     Thrilling and sincere as thine

Offended by a Book of the Writer's

     NOW that my page upcloses, doomed, maybe,
     Never to press thy cosy cushions more,
     Or wake thy ready Yeas as heretofore,
     Or stir thy gentle vows of faith in me:

     Knowing thy natural receptivity,
     I figure that, as flambeaux banish eve,
     My sombre image, warped by insidious heave
     Of those less forthright, must lose place in thee.

     So be it. I have borne such. Let thy dreams
     Of me and mine diminish day by day,
     And yield their space to shine of smugger things;
     Till I shape to thee but in fitful gleams,
     And then in far and feeble visitings,
     And then surcease. Truth will be truth alway. 

FLOWERS to the fair: To you these flowers I bring,
And strive to greet you with an earlier spring.
Flowers sweet, and gay, and delicate like you;
Emblems of innocence, and beauty too.
With flowers the Graces bind their yellow hair,
And flowery wreaths consenting lovers wear. 

Flowers, the sole luxury which nature knew,
In Eden's pure and guiltlese garden grew.
To loftier forms are rougher tasks assign'd;
The sheltering oak resists the stormy wind,
The tougher yew repels invading foes,
And the tall pine for future navies grows;
But this soft family, to cares unknown,
Were born for pleasure and delight alone.
Gay without toil, and lovely without art,
They spring to cheer the sense, and glad the heart.
Nor blush, my fair, to own you copy these;
Your best, your sweetest empire is--to please. 

O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
Missing so much and so much?
O fat white woman whom nobody loves,
Why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
When the grass is soft as the breast of doves
And shivering sweet to the touch?
O why do you walk through the fields in gloves,
Missing so much and so much

Phillis, how much the times are changed,
Since in a hack the town you ranged,
Since without finery or train you shone,
Conspicuous for your charms alone;
When though you supped on sorry fare,
You nectar seemed with gods to share.
You foolishly to one consigned
Beauty which might charm all mankind:
A desperate lover, who for life
Engaged you when he made his wife.
You then no treasure did inherit,
Your beauty was your only merit,
Your bosom charms divine displayed;
There Cupid still an ambush laid;
Your heart was tender, and your mind
To youthful frolics much inclined.
With so many charms endued,
What woman e'er could be a prude?
That fault, oh! beauty all divine,
Was very far from being thine;
Because of favors you were free,
You were the better liked by me.
How differently you live, grown great,
Your life is but the farce of state;
The hoary porter, who still plies
At your own door, and tells such lies,
Is a just emblem of the age,
His very looks ill-luck presage;
He thinks the duty of his place is
To drive away the loves and graces.
The tender swain's abashed, afraid
Your pompous palace to invade.
When you were young, to my amazement
I've seen them enter at the casement;
I've seen them enter every day,
And in your chamber nimbly play.
Not all your carpets, and your plate,
Not all your proud parade of state,
Those goblets which so brightly shine,
Graved by Germain with art divine;
Those closets nobly furnished, where
Martin's exceeds the China ware,
Your vases of Japan, and all
The brittle wonders of your hall;
Your diamond pendants which appear
With such bright lustre at each ear;
Your solitaires so dazzling bright,
Your pomp which strikes the gazer's sight,
Are worth one quarter of that bliss,
Which once you imparted by a kiss. 

And why an honour'd ragged shirt, that shows,
Like tatter'd ensigns, all its bodie's blows?
Should it be swathed in a vest so dire,
It were enough to set the child on fire;
And in it mantle the new rising heir:
Nor do I know ought worth to wrap it in,
Except my parchment upper-coat of skin;
And then expect no end of its chast tears,
That first was rowl'd in down, now furs of bears.

  But since to ladies 't hath a custome been
Linnen to send, that travail and lye in;
To the nine sempstresses, my former friends,
I su'd; but they had nought but shreds and ends.
At last, the jolli'st of the three times three
Rent th' apron from her smock, and gave it me;
'Twas soft and gentle, subt'ly spun, no doubt;
Pardon my boldnese, madam; HERE'S THE CLOUT. 

Take these flowers which, purple waving,
On the ruin'd rampart grew,
Where, the sons of freedom braving,
Rome's imperial standards flew.

Warriors from the breach of danger
Pluck no longer laurels there;
They but yield the passing stranger
Wild-flower wreaths the Beauty's hair. 

WHO IS EXPECTED SOON TO BECOME VISIBLE

Germ of new life, whose powers expanding slow 
For many a moon their full perfection wait,-
Haste, precious pledge of happy love, to go
Auspicious borne through life's mysterious gate.
What powers lie folded in thy curious frame,-
Senses from objects locked, and mind from thought!
How little canst thou guess thy lofty claim
To grasp at all the worlds the Almighty wrought!
And see, the genial season's warmth to share,
Fresh younglings shoot, and opening roses glow!
Swarms of new life exulting fill the air,-
Haste, infant bud of being, haste to blow!
For thee the nurse prepares her lulling songs,
The eager matrons count the lingering day;
But far the most thy anxious parent longs
On thy soft cheek a mother's kiss to lay.
She only asks to lay her burden down,
That her glad arms that burden may resume;
And nature's sharpest pangs her wishes crown,
That free thee living from thy living tomb.
She longs to fold to her maternal breast
Part of herself, yet to herself unknown;
To see and to salute the stranger guest,
Fed with her life through many a tedious moon.
Come, reap thy rich inheritance of love!
Bask in the fondness of a Mother's eye!
Nor wit nor eloquence her heart shall move
Like the first accents of thy feeble cry.
Haste, little captive, burst thy prison doors!
Launch on the living world, and spring to light!
Nature for thee displays her various stores,
Opens her thousand inlets of delight.
If charmed verse or muttered prayers had power,
With favouring spells to speed thee on thy way,
Anxious I'd bid my beads each passing hour,
Till thy wished smile thy mother's pangs o'erpay. 

Backed up by a feeling; 
Of emotions so intense
So subtle yet sparkling
With love and tenderness
For a baby small and charming
Like the spring in all its newness
Springing forth love in lushness 
For the dearest, the softest bloom
Bringing joys and smiles on every face
Only yesterday I saw you crawling
Today you are walking
Falling and rising in between
And the world happy seeing
Swaying erect and benign
A fountain carrying the lily truth
Pure, pristine holding my breath
The soul of many happy days
Dreamed in your countenance
Little star tucked, kissed and cuddled
Oh dear, where you are gone 
Gone to a distant land
Heard- a belief be disproved	
Not a kin of that kind
Nor made of flesh and blood
Yet a little flower
Wafting fragrance everywhere
Gladdening my heart 
As if out of whole you are a part


Thy hue, dear pledge, is pure and bright
As in that well - remember'd night
When first thy mystic braid was wove,
And first my Agnes whisper'd love.

Since then how often hast thou prest
The torrid zone of this wild breast,
Whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell
With the first sin that peopled hell;
A breast whose blood's a troubled ocean,
Each throb the earthquake's wild commotion!
O if such clime thou canst endure
Yet keep thy hue unstain'd and pure,
What conquest o'er each erring thought
Of that fierce realm had Agnes wrought!
I had not wander'd far and wide
With such an angel for my guide;
Nor heaven nor earth could then reprove me
If she had lived and lived to love me.

Not then this world's wild joys had been
To me one savage hunting scene,
My sole delight the headlong race
And frantic hurry of the chase;
To start, pursue, and bring to bay,
Rush in, drag down, and rend my prey,
Then - from the carcass turn away!
Mine ireful mood had sweetness tamed,
And soothed each wound which pride inflamed: -
If thou hadst lived and lived to love me

On Seeing One on a Lady's Bonnet at Church

Ha! whare ye gaun' ye crowlin ferlie?
Your impudence protects you sairly;
I canna say but ye strunt rarely
     Owre gauze and lace,
Tho faith! I fear ye dine but sparely
     On sic a place.

Ye ugly, creepin, blastit wonner,
Detested, shunn'd by saunt an sinner,
How daur ye set your fit upon her---
     Sae fine a lady!
Gae somewhere else and seek your dinner
     On some poor body.

Swith! in some beggar's hauffet squattle;
There ye may creep, and sprawl, and sprattle;
Wi' ither kindred, jumping cattle;
     In shoals and nations;
Whare horn nor bane ne'er daur unsettle
     Your thick plantations.

Now haud you there! ye're out o' sight,
Below the fatt'rils, snug an tight,
Na, faith ye yet! ye'll no be right,
     Till ye've got on it---
The vera tapmost, tow'rin height
     O' Miss's bonnet.

My sooth! right bauld ye set your nose out,
As plump an grey as onie grozet:
O for some rank, mercurial rozet,
     Or fell, red smeddum,
I'd gie you sic a hearty dose o't,
     Wad dress your droddum!

I wad na been surpris'd to spy
You on an auld wife's flainen toy
Or aiblins some bit duddie boy,
     On's wyliecoat;
But Miss's fine Lunardi! fye!
     How daur ye do't?

O Jeany, dinna toss your head,
An set your beauties a' abread!
Ye little ken what cursed speed
     The blastie's makin!
Thae winks an finger-ends, I dread,
     Are notice takin!

O wad some Power the giftie gie us
To see oursels as ithers see us!
It wad frae monie a blunder free us
     An foolish notion:
What airs in dress an gait wad lea'es us,
     An ev'n devotion

Soaring high; 
Among the clouds, 
Wandering all day, 
In Infinity-Sky, 
In the meadows, 
And in the wood, 
For a morsel of food, 
Touches down 
The bough at sundown, 
Flutters around, 
Looks at her divine nest, 
And lulled by leafy rustles, 
Stooped to joyous rest, 
Oh, little soul, you forget 
Your sunset musical notes, 
That used to pour forth 
From heaven to earth, 
Comforting many 
An anguished soul, 
Bidding all rejoice 
At your sweet notes, 
Sing, little soul, sing 
Let the sweet notes ring 
Louder, longer in my ear, 
Until I fall asleep, 
Forgetting all the world’s care, 
Like you, the soul-bird 
Anchoring high, high in the air


There is health in thy gray wing,
Health of nature’s furnishing.
Say, thou modern-winged antique,
Was thy mistress ever sick?
In each heaving of thy wing
Thou dost health and leisure bring,
Thou dost waive disease and pain
And resume new life again. 

The world in gloom and splendour passes by, 
  And thou in the midst of it with brows that gleam, 
  A creature of that old distorted dream 
  That makes the sound of life an evil cry. 
  Good men perform just deeds, and brave men die, 
  And win not honour such as gold can give, 
  While the vain multitudes plod on, and live, 
  And serve the curse that pins them down: But I 
  Think only of the unnumbered broken hearts, 
  The hunger and the mortal strife for bread, 
  Old age and youth alike mistaught, misfed, 
  By want and rags and homelessness made vile, 
  The griefs and hates, and all the meaner parts 
  That balance thy one grim misgotten pile. 

Wee, modest, crimson-tipped flow'r,
   Thou's met me in an evil hour;
   For I maun crush amang the stoure
           Thy slender stem:
   To spare thee now is past my pow'r,
           Thou bonie gem.

   Alas! it's no thy neibor sweet,
   The bonie lark, companion meet,
   Bending thee 'mang the dewy weet
           Wi' spreck'd breast, 
   When upward-springing, blythe, to greet
           The purpling east.

   Cauld blew the bitter-biting north
   Upon thy early, humble birth;
   Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth
           Amid the storm, 
   Scarce rear'd above the parent-earth
           Thy tender form.

   The flaunting flowers our gardens yield 
   High shelt'ring woods an' wa's maun shield:
   But thou, beneath the random bield 
           O' clod or stane,
   Adorns the histie stibble-field
           Unseen, alane.

   There, in thy scanty mantle clad,
   Thy snawie-bosom sun-ward spread,
   Thou lifts thy unassuming head
           In humble guise; 
   But now the share uptears thy bed,
           And low thou lies!

   Such is the fate of artless maid,
   Sweet flow'ret of the rural shade!
   By love's simplicity betray'd
           And guileless trust; 
   Till she, like thee, all soil'd, is laid
           Low i' the dust.

   Such is the fate of simple bard,
   On life's rough ocean luckless starr'd!
   Unskilful he to note the card
           Of prudent lore,
   Till billows rage and gales blow hard,
           And whelm him o'er!

   Such fate to suffering Worth is giv'n,
   Who long with wants and woes has striv'n,
   By human pride or cunning driv'n
           To mis'ry's brink;
   Till, wrench'd of ev'ry stay but Heav'n,
           He ruin'd sink!

   Ev'n thou who mourn'st the Daisy's fate,
   That fate is thine--no distant date;
   Stern Ruin's ploughshare drives elate,
           Full on thy bloom,
   Till crush'd beneath the furrow's weight
           Shall be thy doom. 

Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie, 
O, what a panic's in thy breastie! 
Thou need na start awa sae hasty, 
Wi' bickering brattle! 
I wad be laith to rin an' chase thee 
Wi' murd'ring pattle! 
 
I'm truly sorry man's dominion, 
Has broken nature's social union, 
An' justifies that ill opinion, 
What makes thee startle 
At me, thy poor, earth-born companion, 
An' fellow-mortal! 
 
I doubt na, whiles, but thou may thieve; 
What then? poor beastie, thou maun live! 
A daimen icker in a thrave 
'S a sma' request; 
I'll get a blessin wi' the lave, 
An' never miss't! 
 
Thy wee bit housie, too, in ruin! 
It's silly wa's the win's are strewin! 
An' naething, now, to big a new ane, 
O' foggage green! 
An' bleak December's winds ensuin, 
Baith snell an' keen! 
 
Thou saw the fields laid bare an' waste, 
An' weary winter comin fast, 
An' cozie here, beneath the blast, 
Thou thought to dwell - 
Till crash! the cruel coulter past 
Out thro' thy cell. 
 
That wee bit heap o' leaves an' stibble, 
Has cost thee mony a weary nibble! 
Now thou's turn'd out, for a' thy trouble, 
But house or hald, 
To thole the winter's sleety dribble, 
An' cranreuch cauld! 
 
But Mousie, thou art no thy lane, 
In proving foresight may be vain; 
The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men 
Gang aft agley, 
An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain, 
For promis'd joy! 
 
Still thou art blest, compar'd wi' me; 
The present only toucheth thee: 
But och! I backward cast my e'e, 
On prospects dreaer! 
An' forward, tho' I canna see, 
I guess an' fear

Untimely Feaver, rude insulting guest,
How didst thou with such unharmonious heat
Dare to distune his well-composed rest;
Whose heart so just and noble stroaks did beat?

What if his Youth and Spirits well may bear
More thick assaults, and stronger siege then this?
We measure not his courage, but our fear:
Not what our selves, but what the Times may miss.

Had not that blood, which thrice his veins did yield,
Been better treasur'd for some glorious day:
At farthest West to paint the liquid field,
And with new Worlds his Masters love to pay?

Tend only now thy vigour to regain;
And pardon these poor Rimes, that would beguile
With mine own grief, some portion of thy pain. 

Your ego’s bad dream drums that vision 
Encountered on page one, pages three to eighty-nine. 
Count the wound-up places where we went aground. 
As an entertainment, zero. Hero horror. Try the line 

Of incestuous relations, hearty friendship, or the cult 
Of the ectoplasmic navel and the ravishments of guilt. 

Page two was delightful. And the margins were wide; 
One was tempted by the imagery of bloody wrists, 
Your hysterogetic spasms and italicized reproofs. 
You may well supplant the tuba if the music lasts. 

Foolish artist, why must you sketch my face
And hound a goddess eyes cannot detect?
I am the daughter born of Speech and Space,
Babble's mother, a voiceless intellect.
I snatch a word before it disappears
Then mimic mindlessly what I have found.
I am Echo--I live within your ears.
If you believe you can paint me, paint sound. 

Was ever any face like this before —
So light a veiling for the soul within,
So pure and yet so pitiful for sin?
They say the soul will pass the Heavy Door,
And yearning upward, learn creation's lore —
The body buried 'neath the earthly din.
But thine shall live forever, it hath been
So near the soul, and shall be evermore.
Oh eyes that see so far thro' misted tears,
Oh Death, behold, these eyes can never die!
Yea, tho' your kiss shall rob these lips of breath,
Their faint, sad smile will still elude thee, Death.
Behold the perfect flower this neck uprears,
And bow thy head and pass the wonder by. 

Oh flower-sweet face and bended flower-like head!
Oh violet whose purple cannot pale,
Or forest fragrance ever faint or fail,
Or breath and beauty pass among the dead!
Yea, very truly has the poet said,
No mist of years or might of death avail
To darken beauty — brighter thro' the veil
We see the glimmer of its-wings outspread.
Oh face embowered and shadowed by thy hair,
Some lotus blossom on a darkened stream!
If ever I have pictured in a dream
My guardian angel, she is like to this,
Her eyes know joy, yet sorrow lingers there,
And on her lips the shadow of a kiss. 

There is a lovely noise about your name, 
Above the shoutings of the city clear, 
More than a moment's merriment, whose claim 
Will greater grow with every mellowed year. 

The people will not bear you down the street, 
Dancing to the strong rhythm of your words, 
The modern kings will throttle you to greet 
The piping voice of artificial birds. 

But the rare lonely spirits, even mine, 
Who love the immortal music of all days, 
Will see the glory of your trailing line, 
The bedded beauty of your haunting lays. 

Too wearily had we and song
Been left to look and left to long,
Yea, song and we to long and look,
Since thine acquainted feet forsook
The mountain where the Muses hymn
For Sinai and the Seraphim.
Now in both the mountains' shine
Dress thy countenance, twice divine!
From Moses and the Muses draw
The Tables of thy double Law!
His rod-born fount and Castaly
Let the one rock bring forth for thee,
Renewing so from either spring
The songs which both thy countries sing:
Or we shall fear lest, heavened thus long,
Thou should'st forget thy native song,
And mar thy mortal melodies
With broken stammer of the skies.

With earth's waters make accord;
Teach how the crucifix may be
Carven from the laurel-tree,
Fruit of the Hesperides
Burnish take on Eden-trees,
The Muses' sacred grove be wet
With the red dew of Olivet,
And Sappho lay her burning brows
In white Cecilia's lap of snows!

Thy childhood must have felt the stings
Of too divine o'ershadowings;
Its odorous heart have been a blossom
That in darkness did unbosom,
Burning spirits, which by night
Bear upon their laden wing
To such hearts impregnating.
For flowers that night-wings fertilize
Mock down the stars' unsteady eyes,
And with a happy, sleepless glance
Gaze the moon out of countenance.
I think thy girlhood's watchers must
Have took thy folded songs on trust,
And felt them, as one feels the stir
Of still lightnings in the hair,
When conscious hush expects the cloud
To speak the golden secret loud
Which tacit air is privy to;
Flasked in the grape the wine they knew,
Ere thy poet-mouth was able
For its first young starry babble.
Keep'st thou not yet that subtle grace?
Yea, in this silent interspace,

The loom which mortal verse affords,
Out of weak and mortal words,
Wovest thou thy singing-weed in,
To a rune of thy far Eden.
Vain are all disguises!  Ah,
Heavenly incognita!
Thy mien bewrayeth through that wrong
The great Uranian House of Song!
As the vintages of earth
Taste of the sun that riped their birth,
We know what never cadent Sun
Thy lamped clusters throbbed upon,
What plumed feet the winepress trod;
Whatever singing-robe thou wear
Has the Paradisal air;
And some gold feather it has kept
Shows what Floor it lately swept

Sweet, sweet and the soft listening heaven reels 
In one blue ecstasy above thy song 
In the red heart of all the opening year, 
In the hushed murmur of low dreaming fields 
Hung under heaven ’twixt dim blue and blue;   
Where the young Summer, purpled and pearled in dew, 
Mirrors herself in June, and knows no wrong. 

Sweet, sweet, throwing thy lack of fear 
The throbbing of earth’s music through and through. 

Dreaming in song,—great pulsing-hearted hills, 
Cradling the dawn in mists and purple veils 
Of vapors, over pearls of lakes and brooks 
Girdled about the neck of half the world, 
When the red birth of the young dreaming June   
Kisses the lands with gales, and murmurs, and trills 
Of melody, lips that blossom with tales 
Of music and color and form and beauty of looks 
And snowy argosies in heaven furled, 
All summer set to one sweet warbled tune.   

And thou, red-throated, comest back to me 
Here in the bare November bleak and chill, 
Breathing the red-ripe of the lusty June 
Over the rime of withered field and mere; 
O heart of music, while I dream of thee,   
Thou gladdest note in the dead Summer’s tune, 
Starved of the last chill berry on thy tree, 
Like some sweet instrument left all unstrung, 
The melodious orchestra of all the year.   
Dead with the sweet dead summer thou had’st sung; 
Dead with the dead year’s voices and clasp of hands; 
Dead with all music and love and laughter and light; 
While chilly and bleak comes up the winter night, 
And shrieks the gust across the leafless lands.(Durlston Head) 


    Lend me an ear
    While I read you here
A page from your history,
    Old cliff—not known
    To your solid stone,
Yet yours inseparably.

    Near to your crown
    There once sat down
A silent listless pair; 
    And the sunset ended,
    And dark descended,
And still the twain sat there.

    Past your jutting head
    Then a line-ship sped,
Lit brightly as a city; 
    And she sobbed: 'There goes
    A man who knows

    He slid apart
    Who had thought her heart
His own, and not aboard
    A bark, sea-bound
        That night they found
Between them lay a sword. 

Let's straighten this out, my little man,
And reach an agreement if we can.
I entered your door as an honored guest.
My shoes are shined and my trousers are pressed,
And I won't stretch out and read you the funnies
And I won't pretend that we're Easter bunnies.
If you must get somebody down on the floor,
What in the hell are your parents for?
I do not like the things that you say
And I hate the games that you want to play.
No matter how frightfully hard you try,
We've little in common, you and I.
The interest I take in my neighbor's nursery
Would have to grow, to be even cursory,
And I would that performing sons and nephews
Were carted away with the daily refuse,
And I hold that frolicsome daughters and nieces
Are ample excuse for breaking leases.
You may take a sock at your daddy's tummy
Or climb all over your doting mummy,
But keep your attentions to me in check,
Or, sonny boy, I will wring your neck.
A happier man today I'd be
Had someone wrung it ahead of me. 

What heart could have thought you? -- 
Past our devisal 
(O filigree petal!) 
Fashioned so purely, 
Fragilely, surely, 
From what Paradisal 
Imagineless metal, 
Too costly for cost? 
Who hammered you, wrought you, 
From argentine vapor? -- 
Passing surmisal, 
He hammered, He wrought me, 
From curled silver vapor, 
To lust of His mind -- 
Thou could'st not have thought me! 
So purely, so palely, 
Tinily, surely, 
Mightily, frailly, 
Insculped and embossed, 
With His hammer of wind, 
And His graver of frost

"Come play with me;
Why should you run
Through the shaking tree
As though I'd a gun
To strike you dead?
When all I would do
Is to scratch your head
And let you go. 

When we become truly ourselves, we just become a swinging door. . .

Sick of the self,
the self-seducing self-
with its games, its fears,
its misty memories, and its prix fixe menu
of seductions (so familiar
even to the seducer)
that he grows sick
of looking at himself
in the mirrored ceiling
before he takes the plunge into this new
distraction from the self
which in fact leads back
to self.

Self-the prison.
Love-the answer and the door.
And yet the self should also be a door,
swinging, letting loves both in and out,
for change
is the world's only fixity, and fixity
her foremost lie.

How to trust love
which has so often
betrayed the betrayer,
seduced the seducer,
and then turned out
to be not even love?
We are jaded,
divorced from our selves
without ever having found
ourselves-and yet we
long for wholeness
if not fixity,
for harmony
if not music of the spheres.

If life is a flood
and there is no ark,
then where do the animals float
two by two?

I refuse to believe
that the flesh falls
from their bones
without ever understanding
ever coming,
and I refuse to believe
that we must leave
this life entirely alone.

Much harumphing
across the ocean,
my brother poet coughs,
clears his throat
(he smokes too much),
and gazes into the murky
depths of his word-processor,
as if it were a crystal ball.
I do not know
all that hides
in his heart of darkness
but I know I love
the thoughts
that cloud the surface
of his crystal ball.

He longs to leap
headlong into his future
and cannot.
This chapter's finished,
his self peels back
a skin.
Snakes hiss,
shedding their scales.
The goddess smiles.
She sends her missives
only to the brave. 

Whither, midst falling dew, 
While glow the heavens with the last steps of day 
Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue 
Thy solitary way? 

Vainly the fowler's eye 
Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong 
As, darkly seen against the crimson sky, 
Thy figure floats along. 

Seek'st thou the plashy brink 
Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide, 
Or where the rocking billows rise and sing 
On the chafed ocean side? 

There is a Power whose care 
Teaches thy way along that pathless coast-- 
The desert and illimitable air-- 
Lone wandering, but not lost. 

All day thy wings have fanned, 
At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere, 
Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land, 
Though the dark night is near. 

And soon that toil shall end; 
Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest, 
And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend, 
Soon, o'er thy sheltered nest. 

Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven 
Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart 
Deeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given, 
And shall not soon depart. 

He who, from zone to zone, 
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight, 
In the long way that I must tread alone, 
Will lead my steps aright. 

You gave, but will not give again

DEAR fellow-artist, why so free
With every sort of company,
With every Jack and Jill?
Choose your companions from the best;
Who draws a bucket with the rest
Soon topples down the hill.
You may, that mirror for a school,
Be passionate, not bountiful
As common beauties may,
Who were not born to keep in trim
With old Ezekiel's cherubim
But those of Beauvarlet.
I know what wages beauty gives,
How hard a life her setvant lives,
Yet praise the winters gone:
There is not a fool can call me friend,
And I may dine at journey's end
With Landor and with Donne.










To set a goal, obtainable,
 To chart one's course through life;
 To truly know that you alone,
 Can brave the storm and strife.
 
 To know within your heart and soul,
 That you can win the game;
 To know that once you've made the mark,
 You will never be the same.
 
 What greater gift can on posses,
 Than the right to make a choice;
 To know that as you walk through life,
 Someone will hear your voice.
 
 To know that you among all men,
 Have reached the goal you set;
 I have not found it yet.


 ‘He' is for third person male gender.
‘She' is for third person female gender.
‘It' is the third person neutral gender.
What is for third person transgender? 
Is that person Sir or Madam? 
Is that person Mr., Mrs., or Miss.

MY godlike friend—nay, do not stare,
You think the phrase is odd-like;
Then surely thou art god-like.


And is thy ardour still the same?
And kindled still at ANNA?
Others may boast a partial flame,
But thou art a volcano!


Ev'n Wedlock asks not love beyond
Death's tie-dissolving portal;
But thou, omnipotently fond,
May'st promise love immortal!


Thy wounds such healing powers defy,
Such symptoms dire attend them,
That last great antihectic try—
MARRIAGE perhaps may mend them.


Sweet Anna has an air-a grace,
Divine, magnetic, touching:
She talks, she charms-but who can trace
The process of bewitching? · · · · · ·



I drenched myself with golden honey liquid, sped to jungles to feed famished insects

I had crisp currency notes stashed in cloth cellars of trouser, distributed knives with razor blades, to my fellow beings in heart breaking agony.

I slept in luxury on cushioned foam of air cooled palace, 
opened lock proof doors, inviting masses residing in tumbledown huts.

i wore grey linen suit studded with infinite beads of gold, 
shed bits of cloth, sprinkled balls of thick silver, 
as I trespassed through victimized regions of the globe.

I drank mammoth bottles of rich brown rum, 
supplied a fleet of tankers, with gallons of water, 
to scorched population, on dry flaming land.

I consumed pungent slices of bacon, tore greedily through chunks of 
chocolate bread, 
inaugurated a king sized food plaza, offering plain rice and curry, 
to those shrunk to mere skeleton skins, all throughout the day.

I roamed round the clock in bullet proof silver sedan, 
with an army of helicopters hovering above, 
I reserved glass facaded showrooms full of high powered bike, 
for bare feet trampling needle shaped weeds emanating from soil.

I attended school offering elite courses in management, 
reclined on plush chair, while copying notes, 
built school monasteries to educate the girl child.

drizzling from multiple pores of modern shower assembly, 
supplied electric geysers with aluminum coil, 
to those freezing in chilly currents of winter wind.

this is my pledge to all affluent existing, 
try and emulate, a fraction of my benevolent deeds, 
the creator will bless you with more than you could ever foresee. 

To My Haters 

People look at me and laugh,  
They walk around like clowns wishing they  
Had what it takes to walk my way, 
What a shame to still someone else name, 
They go around and say bad things and 
Get others to believe something that isn't true  
About me how crazy but I will never let you  
Bring me down don't you see you could never  
Will never change my DNA, 
They make fun of my every move,  
But then I must say look in the mirror and what  
Do you see is darkness in your life, 
Not to pretty is it? 
What I want to know is what is it about me that people hate,  
Could it be the fact that I have nothing to prove,  
People are just ignorant for no apparent reason,  
I love me that is just the way it is, 
They talk about me every season for whatever reason, 
If they see a hot man look my way thing can get nasty 
That will tell him bad things about me for him to look  
Some were else as long as it was not at me, 
What for, I don't know, this war has been going on to long, 
I don't really care, and my attitude shows it,  
People are going to talk if I like it are not, 
But, that's okay because I know how to walk, 
And how to be myself,  
They are wasting their time talking about me, 
I'm using my time to walk away so free in summers breeze 
On easy with my happiness I am me, 
I don't have time to play little childish games,  
My life is so real I don't need to play the loser games, 
But I want to say thank you for taking your time out for me  
Because it means I'm doing something right I'm always on  
Your hateful minds, 
I feel life is going just fine :)  
I really don't like to fight I love me you must see :)  
People are only looking at me because they wish they was me, 
They spend hours looking on the outside of me,  
Wow they would hate me, even more if they see my big heart 
Of what makes me,  
The part of me they should talk about is what's in the inside, 
Of hat and shame of child play, 
They also look at the downfalls of themselves,  
I know that must really hurt but don't give me your dirt, 
Sometimes, I just have to tell them,  
There's no shame in my game,  
I have a lot of love for  myself and I don't want to take time out 
To put your nasty ways in my heart, 
So, people can take their opinions about me and stack them on a shelf,  
And take the book down and write down what you have learn, 
For those who look at me and make fun of me, 
I know I'm all in the game of being me, 
I just have to ask you something,  
Are you really looking at me are your nasty self, 
For those who are laughing at me, 
I bet you cry in your sleep 
wishing you was never that mean, 
I want to tell ask you something,  
Is it really me you're laughing at,  
This is a poem for my 'Haters' 
to think about not me but at themselves 
Love to all my haters :)  





My head was up in the clouds
No daylight to be found.
White and gray clouds  covered my sight
I could not see for my mind was in flight.
I looked all around and all I could see
Was the clouds covering me.

I felt like I was in a plane
And all the passengers seeing the same.

So I know I’m not the only one
Who feels this way
Millions of people go through this
From day to day.

It doesn’t matter to you what 
The others are going through
Just that it’s happening to you.
You don’t like this feeling 
of being up in the air
And with others your thoughts
You can not share.
Is this a sign of dementia or Alzheimer’s 
Disease, And can I set myself free.
They say " the mind is a terrible thing to lose"
It is not something that we choose.
Will I forget my loved ones
And everything that’s around
Will I stumble and fall to the ground.

Right now we still have our faculties
But for how long will that be? 
So let us continue to write while we can
For tomorrow we can not plan.
Write everything that you think
See and feel, for in the future
Your mind may reel.
Head up in the clouds? Who is to say.
Until the medical fields find a better way. 

I.
When love with unconfined wings
  Hovers within my gates;
And my divine ALTHEA brings
  To whisper at the grates;
When I lye tangled in her haire,
  And fetterd to her eye,
The birds, that wanton in the aire,
  Know no such liberty.

                    II.
When flowing cups run swiftly round
  With no allaying THAMES,
Our carelesse heads with roses bound,
  Our hearts with loyal flames;
When thirsty griefe in wine we steepe,
  When healths and draughts go free,
Fishes, that tipple in the deepe,
  Know no such libertie.

                    III.
When (like committed linnets) I
  With shriller throat shall sing
The sweetnes, mercy, majesty,
  And glories of my King.
When I shall voyce aloud, how good
  He is, how great should be,
Inlarged winds, that curle the flood,
  Know no such liberty.

                    IV.
Stone walls doe not a prison make,
  Nor iron bars a cage;
Mindes innocent and quiet take
  That for an hermitage;
If I have freedome in my love,
  And in my soule am free,
Angels alone that sore above
  Enjoy such liberty. 

AMARANTHA sweet and fair, 
Ah, braid no more that shining hair! 
As my curious hand or eye 
Hovering round thee, let it fly! 

Let it fly as unconfined 
As its calm ravisher the wind, 
Who hath left his darling, th' East, 
To wanton o'er that spicy nest. 

Every tress must be confest, 
But neatly tangled at the best; 
Like a clew of golden thread 
Most excellently ravelled. 

Do not then wind up that light 
In ribbands, and o'ercloud in night, 
Like the Sun in 's early ray; 
But shake your head, and scatter day

TO AMARANTHA; THAT SHE WOULD DISHEVELL HER HAIRE.

                    I.
  Amarantha sweet and faire,
Ah brade no more that shining haire!
  As my curious hand or eye,
Hovering round thee, let it flye.

                    II.
  Let it flye as unconfin'd
As it's calme ravisher, the winde,
  Who hath left his darling, th' East,
To wanton o're that spicie neast.

                    III.
  Ev'ry tresse must be confest:
But neatly tangled at the best;
  Like a clue of golden thread,
Most excellently ravelled.

                    IV.
  Doe not then winde up that light
In ribands, and o'er-cloud in night,
  Like the sun in's early ray;
But shake your head, and scatter day.

                    V.
  See, 'tis broke! within this grove,
The bower and the walkes of love,
  Weary lye we downe and rest,
And fanne each other's panting breast.

                    VI.
  Heere wee'll strippe and coole our fire,
In creame below, in milk-baths higher:
  And when all wells are drawne dry,
I'll drink a teare out of thine eye.

                    VII.
  Which our very joys shall leave,
That sorrowes thus we can deceive;
  Or our very sorrowes weepe,
That joyes so ripe so little keepe. 

Far away
Lives a girl with tender in her eyes
I’ve never seen her for real
But she smiles, that I can feel
And I can just imagine
How it looks when she cries

Far away, 
It seems like in a different world
Acting pays her wage
She acts when she’s on stage
But never in real life
She is not that kind of girl

Nearby, 
She meets me in my soul
Reading poems of Yeats
Sending pics while I wait
She is playing herself
It is ever her most amazing role


The time you won your town the race
We chaired you through the market-place; 
Man and boy stood cheering by, 
And home we brought you shoulder-high. 

To-day, the road all runners come, 
Shoulder-high we bring you home, 
And set you at your threshold down, 
Townsman of a stiller town. 

Smart lad, to slip betimes away
From fields where glory does not stay
And early though the laurel grows
It withers quicker than the rose. 

Eyes the shady night has shut
Cannot see the record cut, 
And silence sounds no worse than cheers
After earth has stopped the ears: 

Now you will not swell the rout
Of lads that wore their honours out, 
Runners whom renown outran
And the name died before the man. 

So set, before its echoes fade, 
The fleet foot on the sill of shade, 
And hold to the low lintel up
The still-defended challenge-cup. 

And round that early-laurelled head
Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead, 
And find unwithered on its curls
The garland briefer than a girl's. 

Thou yellow trumpeter of laggard Spring! 
Thou herald of rich Summer's myriad flowers! 
The climbing sun with new recovered powers 
Does warm thee into being, through the ring 
Of rich, brown earth he woos thee, makes thee fling 
Thy green shoots up, inheriting the dowers 
Of bending sky and sudden, sweeping showers, 
Till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing 
To make all nature glad, thou art so gay; 
To fill the lonely with a joy untold; 
Nodding at every gust of wind to-day, 
To-morrow jewelled with raindrops. Always bold 
To stand erect, full in the dazzling play 
Of April's sun, for thou hast caught his gold. 

If only the love
you once felt for me
had portrayed the passion
known the depth
possessed the permanence
of your present hatred. 

A Whimsey

     AH, child, thou art but half thy darling mother's;
        Hers couldst thou wholly be,
     My light in thee would outglow all in others;
        She would relive to me.
     But niggard Nature's trick of birth
        Bars, lest she overjoy,
     Renewal of the loved on earth
        Save with alloy.

     The Dame has no regard, alas, my maiden,
        For love and loss like mine--
     No sympathy with mind-sight memory-laden;
        Only with fickle eyne.
     To her mechanic artistry
        My dreams are all unknown,
     And why I wish that thou couldst be
        But One's alone

Breathe not, hid Heart: cease silently,
And though thy birth-hour beckons thee,
Sleep the long sleep:
The Doomsters heap
Travails and teens around us here,
And Time-Wraiths turn our songsingings to fear.

Hark, how the peoples surge and sigh,
And laughters fail, and greetings die;
Hopes dwindle; yea,
Faiths waste away,
Affections and enthusiasms numb:
Thou canst not mend these things if thou dost come.

Had I the ear of wombed souls
Ere their terrestrial chart unrolls,
And thou wert free
To cease, or be,
Then would I tell thee all I know,
And put it to thee: Wilt thou take Life so?

Vain vow! No hint of mine may hence
To theeward fly: to thy locked sense
Explain none can
Life's pending plan:
Thou wilt thy ignorant entry make
Though skies spout fire and blood and nations quake.

Fain would I, dear, find some shut plot
Of earth's wide wold for thee, where not
One tear, one qualm,
Should break the calm.
But I am weak as thou and bare;
No man can change the common lot to rare.

Must come and bide. And such are we --
Unreasoning, sanguine, visionary --
That I can hope
Health, love, friends, scope
In full for thee; can dream thou'lt find
Joys seldom yet attained by humankind

This last experience made it clear to me:
despite your talents,
despite being tall and handsome as a man,
you're still a boy
who finds his peace in a girl's tears,
who seeks comfort in the pain that lies
in tattered butterflies
and the broken wings of turtle-doves,
who can destroy all ideals
for the playful pursuit of a whim.
How should I share with you my perception, my sense of things,
how should I take you with me on my mind's journey?
You're small compared to me,
you'll always be,
for I'm also the mother of my ancestors.

These doth one call, those doth another, fairest
Sights on earth: I say that my love of all is
Sweetest and rarest.
Hear the proof, which lightly, I wot, convinces: —
'Mid the comely, Helen would fain discover
One without peer, and of the goodly princes
Chose for her lover
Him who brought the glory of Troy to ruin!
Reckless all of parent and child, she lavished
On the alien love for her own undoing;
Troyward was ravished.
Anactoria — she who contemns the blessing
Near at hand, is like to a reed wind-shaken.
Such are you! — love held in secure possessing
You have forsaken.
Her whose footfall's music myself had rather
Hear, and see her face in its beauty beaming.
Than to gaze where horsemen and footmen gather
Panoply-gleaming.
What is best is set above man's attaining;
Yet, if Fortune smiled on us once, 'tis better
To recall with prayer and with upward-straining
Than to forget her. 

high/yellow/black/girl 
walken like the sun u be.

         those who

To any army wife, in Sardis:

Some say a cavalry corps,
some infantry, some again,
will maintain that the swift oars

of our fleet are the finest
sight on dark earth; but I say
that whatever one loves, is.

This is easily proved: did
not Helen --- she who had scanned
the flower of the world's manhood ---

choose as first among men one
who laid Troy's honor in ruin?
warped to his will, forgetting

love due her own blood, her own
child, she wandered far with him.
So Anactoria, although you

being far away forget us,
the dear sound of your footstep
and light glancing in your eyes

would move me more than glitter
of Lydian horse or armored
tread of mainland infantry



You know the place: then
Leave Crete and come to us
waiting where the grove is
pleasantest, by precincts

sacred to you; incense
smokes on the altar, cold
streams murmur through the

apple branches, a young
rose thicket shades the ground
and quivering leaves pour

down deep sleep; in meadows
where horses have grown sleek
among spring flowers, dill

Fill our gold cups with love
stirred into clear nectar



No amount of wealth was enough to appease him; the boundless dungeons  impregnated with glittering gold and silver; proved to be wholesomely futile, 

No amount of cloth was enough to appease him; the colossal fields of blossoming cotton; the mountain of tenacious jute lying limp in the warehouses; proved to
be gruesomely useless, 


No amount of water was enough to appease him; the supremely colossal assemblage of salty ocean waters; every globule of liquid lying scattered on this earth; proved 
to be overwhelmingly miserly, 

No amount of sand was enough to appease him; the mammoth lands of the desert; the chunks of mud sprawled loosely all around the globe; proved to be infinitesimally incomplete to gain his attention, 

No amount of ostentation was enough to appease him; the fathomless battalion of mermaids embellished with exotic flower buds; the fabulous perfume emanating in
abundance from their bodies proved to be a profoundly lost chance, 

No amount of light was enough to appease him; the tremendously unsurpassable blazing island of Sun; the enormous festoon of artificial silvery rays; proved a
power too less to captivate his attention, 

No amount of cars were enough to appease him; the entire fleet of swanky automobiles lines royally in front of the palace; every motorized engine loitering
on the trajectory of this planet; proved to be more minuscule than the red ant to grab his eyes, 

No amount of speech was enough to appease him; the most eloquently woven sentences; the most delectable of voices floating in every cranny of the earth; 
proved utterly hopeless to drift his intense concentration, 

No amount of plants were enough to appease him; the entire outgrowth of the vivaciously wild jungle; the unprecedentedly huge garden of roses enticing all with
their fragrance; proved too wild to waver his Omnipotent nose, 

No amount of power was enough to appease him; the Herculean strength in the bulging muscles of the boxer; the astronomical resilience that the entire township put up in coalition; proved more diminutive than the frigid straw in front of his Omniscient aura, 

No amount of flattery was enough to appease him; the unsurpassable myriad of amicable phrases; infinite slaves kneeling down on his feet in meek obeisance; 
proved too insipid to conjure his attention, 

No amount of heroism was enough to appease him; the entire galaxy of brilliantly scintillating stars; ostentatiously dressed angels walking animatedly and in voluptuous twists on the ramp; proved to frivolous and morbid to evoke his tingling excitement, 

No amount of color was enough to appease him; the stupendously vivid shades of the rainbow; the billions of grandiloquent paintings embossed on the cave walls; 
proved too bland to match his irrefutably resplendent complexion, 

No amount of space was enough to appease him; the vast expanse of azure blue sky; the incomprehensible winds of euphoric atmosphere; proved just a tiny whisker in
front of his invincible power, 

No amount of victory was enough to appease him; the brutal assassination of millions to become the emperor; winning the mightiest of battle that came in
the way; proved too inconspicuous to lure his vision towards you, 

No amount of seniority was enough too appease him; the entire ministry spear headed by the esteemed president; the government ruling the entire world; 
proved too infinitesimal in front of his impregnable power, 

No amount of bloodshed was enough to appease him; the innumerable anecdotes of indiscriminate slaughter; the uncouth slaining of innocent heads in the quest of
achieving territories beyond the greatest; proved an absolutely horrendous effort to try and make him wink, 

And you didn't even have to emulate a sagacious saint or meditate incessantly in order to imprison his attention; Infact all one needed to do was to live harmoniously
in synergy with nature; propagate the virtue of immortal love to as far and distant as one could; spread the essence of equality in whomsoever one encountered; and then you would see it for yourself; that what the most biggest of things had failed to
have an impact; just a small little word called 'Love', was enough in order to 
appease the Almighty Creator. 

I will take you heart.
I will take your soul out of your body
I will not be satisfied
With the touch of your hand
Nor the sweet of your lips alone.
I will take your heart for mine.
I will take your soul.

Aunt Rose—now—might I see you 
with your thin face and buck tooth smile and pain 
of rheumatism—and a long black heavy shoe 
for your bony left leg 
limping down the long hall in Newark on the running carpet 
past the black grand piano 
in the day room 
where the parties were 
and I sang Spanish loyalist songs 
in a high squeaky voice 
(hysterical) the committee listening 
while you limped around the room 
collected the money— 
Aunt Honey, Uncle Sam, a stranger with a cloth arm 
in his pocket 
and huge young bald head 
of Abraham Lincoln Brigade 


—your long sad face 
your tears of sexual frustration 
(what smothered sobs and bony hips 
under the pillows of Osborne Terrace) 
—the time I stood on the toilet seat naked 
and you powdered my thighs with calamine 
against the poison ivy—my tender 
and shamed first black curled hairs 
what were you thinking in secret heart then 
knowing me a man already— 
and I an ignorant girl of family silence on the thin pedestal 
of my legs in the bathroom—Museum of Newark. 





Though I see you walking still, a ghost on Osborne Terrace 
down the long dark hall to the front door 
limping a little with a pinched smile 
in what must have been a silken 
flower dress 
welcoming my father, the Poet, on his visit to Newark 
—see you arriving in the living room 
dancing on your crippled leg 
and clapping hands his book 
had been accepted by Liveright 


Hitler is dead and Liveright’s gone out of business 
The Attic of the Past and Everlasting Minute are out of print 
Uncle Harry sold his last silk stocking 
Claire quit interpretive dancing school 
Buba sits a wrinkled monument in Old 
Ladies Home blinking at new babies 


last time I saw you was the hospital 
pale skull protruding under ashen skin 
blue veined unconscious girl 
in an oxygen tent 
the war in Spain has ended long ago 
Aunt Rose


O Autumn, laden with fruit, and stained
With the blood of the grape, pass not, but sit
Beneath my shady roof; there thou may'st rest,
And tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe,
And all the daughters of the year shall dance!
Sing now the lusty song of fruits and flowers.
`The narrow bud opens her beauties to
The sun, and love runs in her thrilling veins;
Blossoms hang round the brows of Morning, and
Flourish down the bright cheek of modest Eve,
Till clust'ring Summer breaks forth into singing,
And feather'd clouds strew flowers round her head.

`The spirits of the air live on the smells
Of fruit; and Joy, with pinions light, roves round
The gardens, or sits singing in the trees.'
Thus sang the jolly Autumn as he sat;
Then rose, girded himself, and o'er the bleak
Hills fled from our sight; but left his golden load. 

Whither dost thou hurry me,
Bacchus, being full of thee?
This way, that way, that way, this,--
Here and there a fresh Love is;
That doth like me, this doth please;
--Thus a thousand mistresses
I have now:  yet I alone,
Having all, enjoy not one

The rhythmic crunch of the marching feet, 
Down the cobbled roads in the summer heat.
Soldiers in serge, so ready and willing, 
Carriages on trains, their young bodies filling, 
To battlefields, all, set in foreign soil, 
Facing the enemy, their prepared plans to foil.
Never knowing if they would ever return
To the cosy firesides, that would invitingly burn.

With hope they travelled and strove to win, 
To free this world from its sorrow and sin.
As they waved goodbye, their smiles were sweet, 
But inside, each felt a shuddering heart beat.
So full of fear, yet called forward to fight
An opponent to crush,  by day and by night.
Oh, What we owe to these men so fine, 
Who fought with valour on hell’s frontline.



To strive, 
to be the best you can be
to love harder than another
to be observant
to be cautious
to befriend
to be a powerful ally
for your happiness is
my happiness
for life can be
sometimes all or nothing.

AYou do not have to be belle, 
Beautiful and wonderful, 
To be a successful model, 
You must be simply natural, 
Heavenly sexy and normal.

Show at every occasion the image
Of your heart, where a divine rage
Is burning to create a better environment, 
For Mother Earth to become a real firmament, 
And for all creatures that are willing to turn a new page.

You are amazing; you have a cloud of followers, 
You have befuddled friends and foes, 
Little children bring you weekly flowers, 
Grown men cry and kneel in front of your toes, 
And you are often lauded by the crows.

Let’s me remind you again and again, 
That you don’t have to be belle, 
Beautiful and wonderful, 
To be a successful model; 
You quietly have to remain natural and sane. 

To be a mom takes guts, fortitude and patience
It takes courage, love and strength
Some times being a mom means carrying a child behind your heart
Some times being a mom means carrying somebody in your heart

Its a spiritual birth meant for those who have learned to love
Sometimes its given to those who've found this strength

Some people think motherhood is a physical action.  I don't
To be a REAL mom takes heartfelt action and sometimes inaction


Today I want to thank the moms out there who have been there for me in my own process and growth. 

Friend, hope for the guest while you are alive.
Jump into experience while you are alive!
Think.  

and think.  

while you are alive.
What you call 'salvation' belongs to the time before death.

If you don't break your ropes while you're alive,
do you think
ghosts will do it after?

The idea that the soul will join with the ecstatic
Just because the body is rotten -
that is all fantasy.
What is found now is found then.
If you find nothing now,
you will simply end up with an apartment in the City of Death.
If you make love with the divine now, in the next life you will have the face of satisfied desire.

So plunge into the truth, find out who the Teacher is,
     Believe in the Great Sound!

Kabir says this: When the guest is being searched for, it is the intensity of the longing for the Guest that does all the work.
Look at me, and you will see a slave of that intensity. 

Is it sounds
                  converging,
Sounds
            nearing,
Infringement,
                     impingement,
Impact,
            contact
With surfaces of the sounds
Or surfaces without the sounds:
Diagrams,
                skeletal,
                             strange?

Is it winds
                curling round invisible corners?
Polyphony of perfumes?
Antennae discovering an axis,
                          erecting the architecture of a world?

Is it
      orchestration of the finger-tips,
                                                       graph of a fugue:
Scaffold for colours:
                              colour itself being god?




When I was but a withered leaf, 
where art thou my love? 
When air was scarce, I hardly breathe. 
When I longed for you to be there, 
yet you were there never.

When I was but a wasted stream, 
did you ever think of me? 
did I ever evade one of your dreams. 
when I wished for you to be there, 
yet you were there never.

When I was but a ruined song, 
my love, where art thou? 
you left me thinking all alone. 
how you could be with me forever
when on my worst, you were never there.

epnotted chords of jute dangle from ceiling, 
with large throat sized loop hole, 
engulfed in perennial pitch darkness, 
freezing cold bare stone walls, 
a battalion of mosquitoes hovering around, 
bone skeletons partially stuck to floor, 
ghastly designs portraying execution, 
clouds of dirt, with a backdrop of blood, 
the ambience was complete with long iron lever, 
compressible at instants of death command.

the courtroom was packed with audience, 
uniformed guards, fool proof security, 
black coated lawyers, bespectacled judge, 
the murderer was in a sandalwood kiosk, 
tears oozing from eyes, lips painted with fresh blood, 
a volley of arguments followed pursuit, 
law professionals displayed tact and eloquence, 
with the killer being invited to dilapidated gallows, 
ruthlessly hung, with dark hood covering face, 
an aftermath of justice ink printing, 
to be hanged till death


To be in love 
Is to touch with a lighter hand. 
In yourself you stretch, you are well. 
You look at things 
Through his eyes. 
A cardinal is red. 
A sky is blue. 
Suddenly you know he knows too. 
He is not there but 
You know you are tasting together 
The winter, or a light spring weather. 
His hand to take your hand is overmuch. 
Too much to bear. 
You cannot look in his eyes 
Because your pulse must not say 
What must not be said. 
When he 
Shuts a door- 
Is not there_ 
Your arms are water. 
And you are free 
With a ghastly freedom. 
You are the beautiful half 
Of a golden hurt. 
You remember and covet his mouth 
To touch, to whisper on. 
Oh when to declare 
Is certain Death! 
Oh when to apprize 
Is to mesmerize, 
To see fall down, the Column of Gold, 
Into the commonest ash.

our improbability of being

a comfort 

delivered from one mind to another 
ad infinitumto be is not to be, that is

Please! 

Just let me say one thing. 
i want to get out and be free for just one day.
Trapped inside myself 
my inhibitory impulses guard me from myself.
Why is there consideration? 
Why is there expectation? 
Why is there moderation? 

i want to self-indulge and be myself 
free for just a moment, 
me for just a day.

Alas! Who am I? 
My identity lost in the parameters of expectation.
The periphery of my life, 
safeguarded by those who love me.
Love me for me

Let's now take our time,
While we're in our prime,
And old, old age is afar off;
For the evil, evil days
Will come on apace,
Before we can be aware of. 

The people I love the best
jump into work head first
without dallying in the shallows
and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.
They seem to become natives of that element,
the black sleek heads of seals
bouncing like half-submerged balls.

I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,
who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,
who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,
who do what has to be done, again and again.

I want to be with people who submerge
in the task, who go into the fields to harvest
and work in a row and pass the bags along,
who are not parlor generals and field deserters
but move in a common rhythm
when the food must come in or the fire be put out.

The work of the world is common as mud.
Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.
But the thing worth doing well done
has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.
Greek amphoras for wine or oil, 
Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums
but you know they were made to be used. 
The pitcher cries for water to carry
and a person for work that is real. 

To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; 
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, ‘tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep; 
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub; 
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there’s the respect
That makes calamity of so long life; 
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover’d country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of? 
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; 
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action. —Soft you now! 
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember’d. 

To Be Written
There's so much to be written
in a life that is forbidden 
there are the challenges 
that duck behind the darkness 





I live only here, between your eyes and you, 
But I live in your world. What do I do? 
--Collect no interest--otherwise what I can; 
Above all I am not that staring man. 

Riding against the east,
A veering, steady shadow
Purrs the motor-call
Of the man-bird
Ready with the death-laughter
In his throat
And in his heart always
The love of the big blue beyond.

Only a man,
A far fleck of shadow on the east
Sitting at ease
With his hands on a wheel
And around him the large gray wings.
Hold him, great soft wings,
Keep and deal kindly, O wings,
With the cool, calm shadow at the wheel. 

To become
PART of the BEST
is to do
your BEST PART. 

Continue to go on
Continue to pretend; 
You’re happy
Take this failure
Enjoy it
Embrace it
Disregard it
Then replace it
Become engrossed into; 
All those moments; 
They are your-
Lost thoughts
Bring them back
Let the imagination rot
Failure into your; 
Success, release the pressure
I swear this will refresh
All those times when this, 
Felt like the end
I’ll say what we are all feeling
I’ll help the awkward moment
Begin-
I have feelings buried deep
I have emotions and they; 
Make me weak
I will not let go of your hand
I’m so afraid, 
I feel as if I don’t have you, 
I have nothing; 
But, my failure is still there-
My tears are still fresh
The thoughts they, 
Never refreshed, 
This is how it will end
I like you, 
Is there some way, 
That those words-
Can help us begin? 
Other wise I’m afraid; 
I’ll never let go
My failure will become-
The final goodbye
Otherwise known as
The equal end





Bessie, you've made space dizzy
with your perfected technique for snow:
white spatters and a dry brush
feathering everything in the world

seem to make the firmament fly.
Four roads converge on the heart of town,
this knot of white and yellow houses
angling off kilter, their astigmatic windows

almost all in rows. Lucky the skater
threading the yellow tavern's quilt-sized pond,
the yellow dogs who punctuate the village
where our occupations are chasing

and being chaste, sleighing and sledding
and snowshoeing from house to house
in our conical, flamelike hats.
Even the barns are sliding in snow,

though the birches are all golden
and one maple blazes without being consumed.
Is it from a hill nearby we're watching,
or somewhere in the sky? Could we be flying

on slick runners down into the village?
Is that mare with the elegant legs
truly the size of a house,
and is this the store where everyone bought

those pointed hats, the snowshoes that angle
in contradictory directions?
Isn't that Rin Tin Tin, bigtongued
and bounding and in two places at once?

Down there in the world's corner two children
steal away onto the frozen pond,
carrying their toboggan. Even the weathervanes
--bounding fish, a sailing stag--look happy.

The houses are swaying, Bessie,
and nothing is grounded in shadow,
set loose by weather and art
from gravity's constraints.

And though I think this man is falling,
is it anything but joyous,
the arc his red scarf
transcribes in the air

oh! my conscious
i'm being, being use
 i have let my guard
down gutter for a few
i found myself burning
on my own caring

hmmm.  it won't long
i get up,  turn this bong
i can spin it around
like those funny clown
but i have to heal one
more time, i swear, it's mine


Fair pledges of a fruitful tree,
Why do ye fall so fast?
Your date is not so past,
But you may stay yet here a-while,
To blush and gently smile;
And go at last.

What, were ye born to be
An hour or half's delight;
And so to bid good-night?
'Twas pity Nature brought ye forth,
Merely to show your worth,
And lose you quite.

But you are lovely leaves, where we
May read how soon things have
Their end, though ne'er so brave:
And after they have shown their pride,
Like you, a-while;--they glide
Into the grave. 

People say it’s bright and golden up there
And, bright, shining it may very well be
We try and look beyond, straining to see
Our eternal home way up in the air

A glimpse, a glittering hint as we stare
Small sparkles of what’s just beyond the sea
But, as we sit and we dream of what will be
While you and the saints, the banquet, do share

In a flash, an instant, we’ll join you there
While we wait a lifetime to find you, free
Oh, what a reunion, we all agree
We’ll celebrate that day, up in the air

So, run ahead and don’t look far behind
For soon enough, you, we’ll joyfully find



To build a quiet city in his mind: 
A single overwhelming wish; to build, 
Not hastily, for there is so much wind, 
So many eager smilers to be killed, 
Obstructions one might overlook in haste: 
The ruined structures cluttering the past, 


A little at a time and slow is best, 
Crawling as though through endless corridors, 
Remembering always there are many doors 
That open to admit the captured guest 
Once only. 
Yet in spite of loss and guilt 
And hurricanes of time, it might be built: 


A refuge, permanent, with trees that shade 
When all the other cities die and fade. 

Stay while ye will, or go,
And leave no scent behind ye:
Yet trust me, I shall know
The place where I may find ye.

Within my Lucia's cheek,
(Whose livery ye wear)
Play ye at hide or seek,
I'm sure to find ye there. 

Oh when shall the grave hide for ever my sorrow?
Oh when shall my soul wing her flight from this clay?
The present is hell, and the coming to-morrow
But brings, with new torture, the curse of to-day.

From my eye flows no tear, from my lips flow no curses
I blast not the fiends who have hurl'd me from bliss;
For poor is the soul which bewailing rehearses
Its querulous grief, when in anguish like this.

Was my eye, 'stead of tears, with red fury flakes bright'ning,
Would my lips breathe a flame which no stream could assuage
On our foes should my glance launch in vengeance its lightning,
With transport my tongue give loose to its rage.

But now tears and curses, alike unavailing,
Would add to the souls of our tyrants delight;
Could they view us our sad separation bewailing
Their merciless hearts would rejoice at the sight.

Yet still, though we bend with a feign'd resignation,
Life beams not for us with one ray that can cheer;
Love and hope upon earth bring no more consolation,
In the grave is our hope, for in life is our fear.

Oh! when, my adored, in the tomb will they place me,
Since, in life, love and friendship for ever are fled?
If again in the mansion of death I embrace thee,
Perhaps they will leave unmolested the dead. 

When I hear that you express an affection so warm,
Ne'er think, my beloved, that I do not believe;
For your lip would the soul of suspicion disarm,
And your eye beams a ray which can never deceive.

Yet, still, this fond bosom regrets, while adoring,
That love, like the leaf, must fall into the sear;
That age will come on, when remembrance, deploring,
Contemplates the scenes of her youth with a tear;

That the time must arrive, when, no longer retaining
Their auburn, those locks must wave thin to the breeze,
When a few silver hairs of those tresses remaining
Prove nature a prey to decay and disease.

'Tis this, my beloved, which spreads gloom o'er my features,
Though I ne'er shall presume to arraign the decree,
In the death which will one day deprive you of me.

Mistake not, sweet sceptic, the cause of emotion,
No doubt can the mind of your lover invade;
He worships each look with such faithful devotion,
A smile can enchant, or a tear can dissuade.

But as death, my beloved, soon or late shall o'ertake us,
And our breasts, which alive with such sympathy glow,
Will sleep in the grave till the blast shall awake us,
When calling the dead, in earth's bosom laid low,-

Oh! then let us drain, while we may, draughts of pleasure,
Which from passion like ours may unceasingly flow;
Let us pass round the cup of love's bliss in full measure,
And quaff the contents as our nectar below. 

ast a dream beyond your hopes.
Woven in time it spins alive.
Out of unreality it forms.
Dressed with optimism it flys.
When casting dreams aim high.

Dreams cast last through night.
Moon beams shine bright.
In the universe of hope.
They will return to shine. 

Cast a dream beyond your hopes.
Woven in time it spins alive.
Out of unreality it forms.
Dressed with optimism it flys.
When casting dreams aim high.

Dreams cast last through night.
Moon beams shine bright.
In the universe of hope.
They will return to shine. 

You sicken me with lies,
With truthful lies.
And with your pious faces.
And your wide, out-stretched,
While underneath
Is dirt and ugliness,
And rotting hearts,
And wild hyenas howling
In you soul's wasteland. 

Then call me traitor if you must, 
Shout reason and default! 
Say I betray a sacred trust 
Aching beyond this vault. 
I'll bear your censure as your praise, 
For never shall the clan 
Confine my singing to its ways 
Beyond the ways of man. 

No racial option narrows grief, 
Pain is not patriot, 
And sorrow plaits her dismal leaf 
For all as lief as not. 
With blind sheep groping every hill, 
Searching an oriflamme, 
How shall the shpherd heart then thrill 
To only the darker lamb

Now is the rhymer's honest trade
A thing for scornful laughter made. 

The merchant's sneer, the clerk's disdain,
These are the burden of our pain. 

Because of you did this befall,
You brought this shame upon us all. 

You little poets mincing there
With women's hearts and women's hair! 

How sick Dan Chaucer's ghost must be
To hear you lisp of "Poesie"! 

A heavy-handed blow, I think,
Would make your veins drip scented ink. 

You strut and smirk your little while
So mildly, delicately vile!

You snails that crawl along His path! 

With wet, amorphous things like you? 

This thing alone you have achieved:
Because of you, it is believed 

That all who earn their bread by rhyme
Are like yourselves, exuding slime. 

Oh, cease to write, for very shame,
Ere all men spit upon our name! 

Take up your needles, drop your pen,
And leave the poet's craft to men

The lies of fame and love’s resolve
Have vanished now without a trace,
Our youthful passions have dissolved
As though a dream or morning haze.
Yet, still, we’re burning with desire,
And with impatience in our souls,
Beneath the yoke of strength and fire,
We hark our country’s pleading calls.
In expectation, full of ardor,
The day of freedom we await, --
Thus waits a youthful, eager lover
The moment of the promised date.
And whilst with liberty we burn,
And whilst our hearts adore ovation,
Our country needs us, - let us turn
And dedicate our soul’s elation.
My friend, believe me that with thunder,
The star of joy will rise again!
And Russia will arise from slumber,
Our names will be incised with wonder
On remnants of oppressive reign

To change the world enough
you must cease to be afraid
of the poor.
We experience your fear as the least pardonable of
humiliations; in the past
it has sent us scurrying off
daunted and ashamed
into the shadows.
Now,
the world ending
the only one all of us have known
we seek the same
fresh light
you do:
the same high place
and ample table.
The poor always believe
there is room enough
for all of us; 
the very rich never seem to have heard
of this.
In us there is wisdom of how to share
loaves and fishes
however few; 
we do this everyday.
Learn from us,
we ask you.
We enter now
the dreaded location
of Earth's reckoning; 
no longer far
off
or hidden in books
that claim to disclose
revelations; 
it is here.
We must walk together without fear.
There is no path without us




The northern pole supports thy shining throne. 
Behold what furrows age and steel can plough; 
The helmet's weight oppressed this wrinkled brow. 
Through fate's untrodden paths I move; my hands 
Still act my free-born people's bold commands; 
Yet this stern shade, to you submits his frowns, 
Nor are these looks always severe to crowns. 



Thine eyes shall see the light of distant skies:
Yet, COLE! thy heart shall bear to Europe's strand
A living image of thy native land,
Such as on thine own glorious canvas lies;
Lone lakes--savannas where the bison roves--
Rocks rich with summer garlands--solemn streams--
Skies, where the desert eagle wheels and screams--
Spring bloom and autumn blaze of boundless groves.
Fair scenes shall greet thee where thou goest--fair,
But different--everywhere the trace of men,
Paths, homes, graves, ruins, from the lowest glen
To where life shrinks from the fierce Alpine air,
Gaze on them, till the tears shall dim thy sight,
But keep that earlier, wilder image bright. 


Who never lived long enough to screw
He was gay hearted, young and handsome
And all the secrets of life he knew
He would always arrive on time for breakfast
Scamper on your feet and chase the ball
He was faster than any polo pony
He never worried a minute at all
His tail was a plume that scampered with him
He was black as night and as fast as light.
So the bad cats killed him in the fall. 


In thee I fondly hoped to clasp
A friend whom death alone could sever;
Till envy, with malignant grasp,
Detach'd thee from my breast for ever.

True, she has forced thee from my breast,
Yet in my heart thou keep'st thy seat;
There, there thine image still must rest,
Until that heart shall cease to beat.

And when the grave restored her dead,
When life again to dust is given,
On thy dear breast I'll lay my head--
Without thee where would be my heaven?



Fair Daffodils, we weep to see
    You haste away so soon;
As yet the early-rising sun
    Has not attain'd his noon.
            Stay, stay,
        Until the hasting day
            Has run
        But to the even-song;
And, having pray'd together, we
Will go with you along.

We have short time to stay, as you,
    We have as short a spring;
As quick a growth to meet decay,
    As you, or anything.
            We die
        As your hours do, and dry
            Away,
        Like to the summer's rain;
Or as the pearls of morning's dew,
Ne'er to be found again. 


Ah, drops of gold in whitening flame
Burning, we know your lovely name -
Daisies, that little children pull!
Like all weak things, over the strong
Ye do not know your power for wrong,
And much abuse your feebleness.
Daisies, that little children pull,
As ye are weak, be merciful!
O hide your eyes! they are to me
Beautiful insupportably.
Or be but conscious ye are fair,
And I your loveliness could bear,
But, being fair so without art,
Ye vex the silted memories of my heart!

As a pale ghost yearning strays
With sundered gaze,
'Mid corporal presences that are
To it impalpable - such a bar
Sets you more distant than the morning-star.
Such wonder is on you, and amaze,
I look and marvel if I be
Indeed the phantom, or are ye?
The light is on your innocence
Which fell from me.
The fields ye still inhabit whence
My world-acquainted treading strays,
The country where I did commence;
And though ye shine to me so near,
So close to gross and visible sense, -
Between us lies impassable year on year.


To other time and far-off place
Belongs your beauty: silent thus,
Though to other naught you tell,
To me your ranks are rumorous
Of an ancient miracle.
Vain does my touch your petals graze,
I touch you not; and though ye blossom here,
Your roots are fast in alienated days.
Ye there are anchored, while Time's stream
Has swept me past them: your white ways
And infantile delights do seem
To look in on me like a face,
Dead and sweet, come back through dream,
With tears, because for old embrace
It has no arms.

These hands did toy,
Children, with you, when I was child,
And in each other's eyes we smiled:
Not yours, not yours the grievous-fair
Apparelling
With which you wet mine eyes; you wear,
Ah me, the garment of the grace
I wove you when I was a boy;
O mine, and not the year's your stolen Spring!
And since ye wear it,
Hide your sweet selves! I cannot bear it.
For when ye break the cloven earth
With your young laughter and endearment,
No blossomy carillon 'tis of mirth
To me; I see my slaughtered joy
Bursting its cerement. 


Shut not so soon; the dull-eyed night
Has not as yet begun
To make a seizure on the light,
Or to seal up the sun.

No marigolds yet closed are,
No shadows great appear;
Nor doth the early shepherds' star
Shine like a spangle here.

Stay but till my Julia close
Her life-begetting eye;
And let the whole world then dispose
Itself to live or die. 


To-day, this insect, and the world I breathe,
Now that my symbols have outelbowed space,
Time at the city spectacles, and half
The dear, daft time I take to nudge the sentence,
In trust and tale I have divided sense,
Slapped down the guillotine, the blood-red double
Of head and tail made witnesses to this
Murder of Eden and green genesis.

The insect certain is the plague of fables.

This story's monster has a serpent caul,
Blind in the coil scrams round the blazing outline,
Measures his own length on the garden wall
And breaks his shell in the last shocked beginning;
A crocodile before the chrysalis,
Before the fall from love the flying heartbone,
Winged like a sabbath ass this children's piece
Uncredited blows Jericho on Eden.

The insect fable is the certain promise.

Death: death of Hamlet and the nightmare madmen,
An air-drawn windmill on a wooden horse,
John's beast, Job's patience, and the fibs of vision,
Greek in the Irish sea the ageless voice:
'Adam I love, my madmen's love is endless,
No tell-tale lover has an end more certain,
All legends' sweethearts on a tree of stories,
My cross of tales behind the fabulous curtain.


'Thou bidst me come away,
And I'll no longer stay,
Than for to shed some tears
For faults of former years;
And to repent some crimes
Done in the present times;
And next, to take a bit
Of bread, and wine with it;
To don my robes of love,
Fit for the place above;
To gird my loins about
With charity throughout;
And so to travel hence
With feet of innocence;
These done, I'll only cry,


O King of Terrors, whose unbounded Sway 
All that have Life, must certainly Obey; 
The King, the Priest, the Prophet, all are Thine, 
My Name is on thy Roll, and sure I must 
Encrease thy gloomy Kingdom in the Dust. 
My soul at this no Apprehension feels, 
But trembles at thy Swords, thy Racks, thy Wheels; 
Thy scorching Fevers, which distract the Sense, 
And snatch us raving, unprepar'd from hence; 
At thy contagious Darts, that wound the Heads 
Of weeping Friends, who wait at dying Beds. 
Spare these, and let thy Time be when it will; 
My Bus'ness is to Dye, and Thine to Kill. 
Gently thy fatal Sceptre on me lay, 
And take to thy cold Arms, insensibly, thy Prey. 


You're my heart, you're my soul, 
Pure like water having no foul.
You want me more than do I, 
Know this very well, here's no lie.
You love me never to desert, 
Love me really, there's no flirt.
Eagerly you move, I'm busy though, 
You'll wait till night, surely I know.
Like a shade you move by my side, 
With my pleasures, always you fight.
To take me away in your land, 
Slowly in dark touching my hand.
I want you too after my task, 
Wait a little more, it's now dusk. 

You're my heart, you're my soul,

Wilted red where roses bloom, 
the smell of death and sweet perfume.
Where hearts are pierced and lovers meet, 
Where death has flavour and tastes so sweet.

To die to self to love again, 
in winter chills and pouring rain.
Where ice will thaw and you fall through, 
Where your heart will learn what it was meant to do. 




Stirs not thy spirit, Priestley! as the train
With low obeisance, and with servile phrase,
File behind file, advance, with supple knee,
And lay their necks beneath the foot of power?
Burns not thy cheek indignant, when thy name,
On which delighted Science loved to dwell,
Becomes the bandied theme of hooting crowds?
With timid caution, or with cool reserve,
When e'en each reverend brother keeps aloof,
Eyes the struck deer, and leaves thy naked side
A mark for Power to shoot at? Let it be.
"On evil days though fallen and evil tongues,"


To thee, the slander of a passing age
Imports not. Scenes like these hold little space
In his large mind, whose ample stretch of thought
Grasps future periods.—Well canst thou afford
To give large credit for that debt of fame
Thy country owes thee. Calm thou canst consign it
To the slow payment of that distant day,—
If distant,—when thy name, to Freedom's joined,
Shall meet the thanks of a regenerate land. 


You are not beautiful, exactly.
You are beautiful, inexactly.
You let a weed grow by the mulberry
And a mulberry grow by the house.
So close, in the personal quiet
Of a windy night, it brushes the wall
And sweeps away the day till we sleep.


A child said it, and it seemed true:
"Things that are lost are all equal

"
But it isn't true. If I lost you,
The air wouldn't move, nor the tree grow.
Someone would pull the weed, my flower.
The quiet wouldn't be yours. If I lost you,
I'd have to ask the grass to let me sleep.




I slumbered with your poems on my breast
Spread open as I dropped them half-read through
Like dove wings on a figure on a tomb
To see, if in a dream they brought of you,

I might not have the chance I missed in life
Through some delay, and call you to your face
First soldier, and then poet, and then both,
Who died a soldier-poet of your race.

I meant, you meant, that nothing should remain
Unsaid between us, brother, and this remained--
And one thing more that was not then to say:
The Victory for what it lost and gained.


You went to meet the shell's embrace of fire
On Vimy Ridge; and when you fell that day
The war seemed over more for you than me,
But now for me than you--the other way.

How over, though, for even me who knew
The foe thrust back unsafe beyond the Rhine,
If I was not to speak of it to you
And see you pleased once more with words of mine


Love at the lips was touch 
As sweet as I could bear; 
And once that seemed too much; 
I lived on air 

That crossed me from sweet things, 
The flow of - was it musk 
From hidden grapevine springs 
Down hill at dusk? 

I had the swirl and ache 
From sprays of honeysuckle 
That when they're gathered shake 
Dew on the knuckle. 

I craved strong sweets, but those 
Seemed strong when I was young; 
The petal of the rose 
It was that stung. 

Now no joy but lacks salt 
That is not dashed with pain 
And weariness and fault; 
I crave the stain 

Of tears, the aftermark 
Of almost too much love, 
The sweet of bitter bark 
And burning clove. 

When stiff and sore and scarred 
I take away my hand 
From leaning on it hard 
In grass and sand, 

The hurt is not enough: 
I long for weight and strength 
To feel the earth as rough 
To all my length. 


Fair Youth! who wish the Wars may cease, 
We own you better form'd for Peace. 
Nor Pallas you, nor Mars shou'd follow; 
Who give sweet Looks, and early Rhimes, 
Bespeaking Joys, and Halcyon Times. 
Your Face, which We, as yet, may praise, 
Calls for the Myrtle, and the Bays. 
The Martial Crowns Fatigues demand, 
And laurell'd Heroes must be tann'd; 
A Fate, we never can allow 
Shou'd reach your pleasing, polish'd Brow. 
But granting what so young you've writ, 
From Nature flow'd, as well as Wit; 
And that indeed you Peace pursue, 
We must begin to Treat with you. 


We Females, Sir, it is I mean: 
For all the Ladies of your Age 
As Plenipo' betimes engage; 
And as first Article declare, 
You shall be Faithful as you're Fair: 
No Sighs, when you shall know their Use, 
Shall be discharg'd in Love's Abuse; 
Nor kindling Words shall undermine, 
Till you in equal Passion join. 
Nor Money be alone your Aim, 
Tho' you an Over-weight may claim, 
And fairly build on your Desert, 
If with your Person goes your Heart. 
But when this Barrier I have gain'd, 
And trust it will be well maintain'd; 
Who knows, but some imprudent She 
Betraying what's secur'd by me, 
Shall yield thro' Verse, or stronger Charms, 
To Treat anew on easier Terms? 


And I be negligently told– 
You was too Young, and I too Old, 
To have our distant Maxims hold. 

I dare not ask a kiss,
I dare not beg a smile; 
Lest having that, or this,
I might grow proud the while.

No, no, the utmost share
Of my desire shall be,
Only to kiss that air
That lately kissed thee,



Dear Bessie, would my tired rhyme 
Had force to rise from apathy, 
And shaking off its lethargy 

But in my soul's high belfry, chill 
The bitter wind of doubt has blown, 
The summer swallows all have flown, 
The bells are frost-bound, mute and still. 

Upon the crumbling boards the snow 
Has drifted deep, the clappers hang 
Prismed with icicles, their clang 
Unheard since ages long ago. 

The rope I pull is stiff and cold, 
My straining ears detect no sound 
Except a sigh, as round and round 
The wind rocks through the timbers old. 

Below, I know the church is bright 
With haloed tapers, warm with prayer; 
But here I only feel the air 
Of icy centuries of night. 

Beneath my feet the snow is lit 
And gemmed with colours, red, and blue, 
Topaz, and green, where light falls through 
The saints that in the windows sit. 


Here darkness seems a spectred thing, 
Voiceless and haunting, while the stars 
Mock with a light of long dead years 
The ache of present suffering. 

Silent and winter-killed I stand, 
No carol hymns my debt to you; 
But take this frozen thought in lieu, 
And thaw its music in your hand. 

While fates permit us, let's be merry; 
Pass all we must the fatal ferry; 
And this our life, too, whirls away,
With the rotation of the day. 


In every school, to every student
 there's a special teacher.
 To every teacher, to every student
 there's a special bond.
 To every bond to every moment
 There's a special time that we'll think
 back and say to ourself's "That teacher 
 really cared!"
 If you know that teacher cares
 you're life will brighten up.
 Cause now you know that
 if you fall, that same special teacher
 Will come and help you up. 


To everything there is a season
A time for every purpose under Heaven

A time to be born 
and a time to die
A time to plant 
and a time to pluck what is planted

A time to kill
and a time to heal
A time to break down
and a time to build up

A time to cast away stones
and a time to gather stones
A time to embrace 
and a time to refrain from embracing

A time to gain 
and a time to lose 
A time to keep 
and a time to cast away

A time to tear 
and a time to sew
A time to keep silence 
and a time to speak

A time of love 
and a time of hate
A time of war 
and a time of peace


Beloved! amid the earnest woes
         That crowd around my earthly path-
       (Drear path, alas! where grows
       Not even one lonely rose)-
         My soul at least a solace hath
       In dreams of thee, and therein knows
       An Eden of bland repose.

       And thus thy memory is to me
         Like some enchanted far-off isle
       In some tumultuous sea-
       Some ocean throbbing far and free
         With storms- but where meanwhile
       Serenest skies continually
       Just o'er that one bright island smile. 


Thou wouldst be loved?- then let thy heart
              From its present pathway part not!
            Being everything which now thou art,
              Be nothing which thou art not.
            So with the world thy gentle ways,
              Thy grace, thy more than beauty,
            Shall be an endless theme of praise,
              And love- a simple duty. 


Trying to be so elusive in my pursuits of affection, 
To try to be ignorant with my affliction, 
Wondering what would happen if I dare fall.

To befriend her, sharing sweet moments after another, to start to fall-
How it overpowers me with vigor, to deny all others-
To soar through the sky once I’m there, never to be taken down.

To stand dazzled at the beauty of the only true love, 
Where no other dame or mistress can stand to compare, 
How words have no meaning once you’re there-

Straining the heart when true love is far away, 
Only to be built stronger when your only love returns.
Never feeling guilty or having seconds thought of saying the words-

The three words that no other can conquer, 
Uttering them can bring light to darkest night, 
How they can change your whole world, and empower you so.


‘I love you-’I cry your mercy—pity—love!—aye, love!
Merciful love that tantalizes not,
One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,
Unmasked, and being seen—without a blot!
O! let me have thee whole,—all—all—be mine!
That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest
Of love, your kiss,—those hands, those eyes divine,
That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,— 
Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all,
Withhold no atom's atom or I die,
Or living on, perhaps, your wretched thrall,
Forget, in the mist of idle misery,
Life's purposes,—the palate of my mind
Losing its gust, and my ambition blind


Sunned in the South, and here to-day; 
   --If all organic things 
Be sentient, Flowers, as some men say, 
   What are your ponderings? 

How can you stay, nor vanish quite 
   From this bleak spot of thorn, 
And birch, and fir, and frozen white 
   Expanse of the forlorn? 

Frail luckless exiles hither brought! 
   Your dust will not regain 
Old sunny haunts of Classic thought 
   When you shall waste and wane; 

But mix with alien earth, be lit 
   With frigid Boreal flame, 
And not a sign remain in it 
   To tell men whence you came.

You tend to divert

Love is what you give
Not what you want to receive
Come what may, Love
Is prepared to forgive


The Sun may have forgotten to shine at times; leaving the Earth submerged in partial darkness, 

The eyes may have forgotten to close; staring unrelentingly in the blazing fires, 

The trees may have forgotten to shed their leaves; enticed to sway in the moist breeze, 

The birds may have forgotten to chirp; thoroughly engrossed in building their nests, 

The clouds may have forgotten to rain; drifting away submissively with the wind, 

The lion may have forgotten to roar; lost in the aisles of desire and sleep, 

The chameleon may have forgotten to change its color; with its jaws busy in gobbling fat caterpillars, 

The diamonds may have forgotten to shine; when they were placed in a 
disdainful backdrop of coal, 

The rose may have forgotten to diffuse scent; trying to breathe for its life amidst a heap of pungent pesticide, 

The scorpion may have forgotten to sting; running haywire in a pool of slushy water, 

The snow may have forgotten to melt; not wanting to leave the body of the handsome mountain, 

The lips may have forgotten to smile; being besieged by day to day professionalism in society, 

The ocean may have forgotten to evolve waves; yielding pathetically to the tumultuous storm, 

The stars in the cosmos may have forgotten to twinkle; profoundly absorbed in watching the dainty fairies, 

The deserts may have forgotten to be hot; relishing the prospects of freaking out in the rain, 

The fingers may have forgotten to write; resting lazily under the silken feathered pillow, 
The dog may have forgotten to bark; petrified for an instant by the demon standing before him, 

The infant may have forgotten to cry; bemused for a moment by the wide ensemble of electronic toys, 

The Creator inadvertently may have forgotten to look at every man; busy chalking strategies to run the Universe, 

But me Forgetting her was Impossible; as she resided in the center of my heart; and every beat of mine wholesomely depended upon her breath that passionately flowed. 


Whilst I in prison or in court look down,
Nor beg thy favour nor deserve thy frown,
In vain malicious Fortune hast thou tried
By taking from my state to quell my pride:
Insulting girl, thy present rage abate,
And wouldst thou have my humbled, make me great. 


When in the large compartment, 
Everyone was seated.
And all the luggage  loaded, 
The family group completed.

Excitement as the train now
Leaves the local station.
Everyone perceiving
A feeling of elation.

The Servants in the Third Class
All with faces radiant, 
The train now fairly straining
Up it's first steep gradient.

Smoke rising from the engine, 
Through the countryside it races, 
Such a rattling and a clattering, 
Rhythmic chugging as it paces.

Nurse is quietly rocking baby, 
Mother dozing, Father reading.
Children gazing through the window, 
Trees and streams seem to be speeding.

Realisation, train is stopping, 
Doors are opening, whistles blare, 
All alighting from the carriage, 
Platforms busy. Great sea air! 

Call the porter for the luggage, 
What! No luggage, this can't be, 
'Did you tip the porter Father? '
Mother calls out nervously.

Father fuming calls the Driver, 
Calls ths Station Master too, 
Sorry Sir, it's not our doing
We will send it on to you.

Father marching to the taxi, 
Mother fretting following along, 
Nurse with baby shrieking loudly
Children calling, 'What is wrong? '.

Father should have tipped the porter, 
Much more than a farthing's worth, 
So he didn't load the luggage, 
In the 'First Class' luggage berth.

It arrived early next morning, 
By the first train down the track, 
So as to the moral of this story, 
If you're too mean, watch out Jack! 



Nymph of the downward smile and sidelong glance!
In what diviner moments of the day
Art thou most lovely?—when gone far astray
Into the labyrinths of sweet utterance,
Or when serenely wandering in a trance
Of sober thought? Or when starting away,
With careless robe to meet the morning ray,
Thou sparest the flowers in thy mazy dance?
Haply 'tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly,
And so remain, because thou listenest:
But thou to please wert nurtured so completely
That I can never tell what mood is best;
I shall as soon pronounce which Grace more neatly
Trips it before Apollo than the rest. 

I HOLD it, sir, my bounden duty
To warn you how that Master Tootie,
Alias, Laird M'Gaun,
Was here to hire yon lad away
'Bout whom ye spak the tither day,
An' wad hae don't aff han';
But lest he learn the callan tricks—
An' faith I muckle doubt him—
Like scrapin out auld Crummie's nicks,
An' tellin lies about them;
As lieve then, I'd have then
Your clerkship he should sair,
If sae be ye may be
Not fitted otherwhere.


Altho' I say't, he's gleg enough,
An' 'bout a house that's rude an' rough,
The boy might learn to swear;
But then, wi' you, he'll be sae taught,
An' get sic fair example straught,
I hae na ony fear.
Ye'll catechise him, every quirk,
An' shore him weel wi' hell;
An' gar him follow to the kirk—
Aye when ye gang yoursel.
If ye then maun be then
Frae hame this comin' Friday,
Then please, sir, to lea'e, sir,
The orders wi' your lady.


My word of honour I hae gi'en,
In Paisley John's, that night at e'en,
To meet the warld's worm;
To try to get the twa to gree,
An' name the airles an' the fee,
In legal mode an' form:
I ken he weel a snick can draw,
When simple bodies let him:
An' if a Devil be at a',
In faith he's sure to get him.
To phrase you and praise you,.
Ye ken your Laureat scorns:
The pray'r still you share still
Of grateful MINSTREL BURNS. 

Sweet are the pleasures that to verse belong, 
And doubly sweet a brotherhood in song; 
Nor can remembrance, Mathew! bring to view 
A fate more pleasing, a delight more true 
Than that in which the brother Poets joy'd, 
Who with combined powers, their wit employ'd 
To raise a trophy to the drama's muses. 
The thought of this great partnership diffuses 
Over the genius loving heart, a feeling 
Of all that's high, and great, and good, and healing. 

Too partial friend! fain would I follow thee 
Past each horizon of fine poesy; 
Fain would I echo back each pleasant note 
As o'er Sicilian seas, clear anthems float 
'Mong the light skimming gondolas far parted, 
Just when the sun his farewell beam has darted: 
But 'tis impossible, far different cares 
Beckon me sternly from soft 'Lydian airs,' 
And hold my faculties so long in thrall, 
That I am oft in doubt whether at all 
I shall again see Phoebus in the morning: 
Or flush'd Aurora in the roseate dawning! 
Or a white Naiad in a rippling stream; 
Or a rapt seraph in a moonlight beam; 
Or again witness what with thee I've seen, 
The dew by fairy feet swept from the green, 
After a night of some quaint jubilee 
Which every elf and fay had come to see: 
When bright processions took their airy march 
Beneath the curved moon's triumphal arch. 

But might I now each passing moment give 
To the coy muse, with me she would not live 
In this dark city, nor would condescend 
'Mid contradictions her delights to lend. 
Should e'er the fine-eyed maid to me be kind, 
Ah! surely it must be whene'er I find 
Some flowery spot, sequester'd, wild, romantic, 
That often must have seen a poet frantic; 
Where oaks, that erst the Druid knew, are growing, 
And flowers, the glory of one day, are blowing; 
Where the dark-leav'd laburnum's drooping clusters 
Reflect athwart the stream their yellow lustres, 
And intertwined the cassia's arms unite, 
With its own drooping buds, but very white. 
Where on one side are covert branches hung, 
'Mong which the nightingales have always sung 
In leafy quiet; where to pry, aloof, 
Atween the pillars of the sylvan roof, 
Would be to find where violet beds were nestling, 
And where the bee with cowslip bells was wrestling. 
There must be too a ruin dark, and gloomy, 
To say 'joy not too much in all that's bloomy.' 

Yet this is vain--O Mathew lend thy aid 
To find a place where I may greet the maid--
Where we may soft humanity put on, 
And sit, and rhyme and think on Chatterton; 
And that warm-hearted Shakspeare sent to meet him 
Four laurell'd spirits, heaven-ward to intreat him. 
With reverence would we speak of all the sages 
Who have left streaks of light athwart their ages: 
And thou shouldst moralize on Milton's blindness, 
And mourn the fearful dearth of human kindness 
To those who strove with the bright golden wing 
Of genius, to flap away each sting 
Thrown by the pitiless world. We next could tell 
Of those who in the cause of freedom fell; 
Of our own Alfred, of Helvetian Tell; 
Of him whose name to ev'ry heart's a solace, 
High-minded and unbending William Wallace. 
While to the rugged north our musing turns 
We well might drop a tear for him, and Burns. 

Felton! without incitements such as these, 
How vain for me the niggard Muse to tease; 
For thee, she will thy every dwelling grace, 
And make 'a sunshine in a shady place:' 
For thou wast once a flowret blooming wild, 
Close to the source, bright, pure, and undefil'd, 
Whence gush the streams of song: in happy hour 
Came chaste Diana from her shady bower, 
Just as the sun was from the east uprising; 
And, as for him some gift she was devising, 
Beheld thee, pluck'd thee, cast thee in the stream 
To meet her glorious brother’s greeting beam. 
I marvel much that thou hast never told 
How, from a flower, into a fish of gold 
Apollo chang'd thee; how thou next didst seem 
A black-eyed swan upon the widening stream; 
And when thou first didst in that mirror trace 
The placid features of a human face: 
That thou hast never told thy travels strange, 
And all the wonders of the mazy range 
O’er pebbly crystal, and o'er golden sands; 
Kissing thy daily food from Naiad’s pearly hands. 







For the sake of all those trapped mercilessly beneath the rubble; fighting helplessly against death, 

For the sake of all those wails flooding the atmosphere; the fountain of innocent blood sprayed indiscriminately around, 

For the sake of all those struggling for breath; moving their arms and feet despairingly under savage concrete, 

For the sake of all those attendants; buried ruthlessly under the weight of their serving trays


{

For the sake of all those cars squelched to threadbare metal; infinite shards of acrid glass sprawled satanically around, 

For the sake of all those firemen buried alive; while inadvertently trying to extricate the individuals trapped; douse the unrelenting flames and smoke, 

For the sake of all those chunks of limp flesh sprinkled horrendously around; the torn remnants of victims peeping out from every corner, 

For the sake of all those who were maimed for life; losing their limbs under bulky rods of hot iron, 


{

For the sake of all that darkness that engulfed the streets; in the heart of the brilliant morning, 

For the sake of unprecedented terror that had crept in everyone's souls; after the barbaric attacks, 

For the sake of all those offices pulverized to inconspicuous dust; which were once the nerve center of the entire world, 
For the sake of all those mourning relatives; that wept in uncontrolled hysteria as realization dawned upon, 


{

For the sake of unsurpassable devastation that had crept in all quarters of the planet; after the vicious attack, 

For the sake of terrorizing the entire world; by committing irrevocable acts of brutality, 

For the sake of all those graveyards; now brimming to capacity with lifeless mortals, 

For the sake of countless numbers of wives waiting for their husbands; even when they knew that there were frugal chances of finding them alive, 

And over and above all for the sake of all those lives lost; all those infants crawling without support on the ground; all those families rendered missionless after losing inevitable parts of their blood; all those mothers anxiously waiting for their son's to
return with tears welling in their eyes, 


They sucked us in;
King and country,
And the rest.
Patriotism,
Democracy,
Honor-
Words and phrases,
They either bitched or killed us. 


The little I know about you
Is almost too much to bear
That you, who care so little, 
Get to hold him every day


Home is where the heart is. 
But my heart, has no home. 
When I walk into my apartment. 
I am never really alone. 

To go back to my place, 
having a place of my own. 
My Things. In MY space, 
is what makes your place, a home. 

But alas here I am. 
Sitting in walls of white, 
my cookie-cutter den. 
I look down, make sure I'm not in stripes. 

Keep looking forth till someday- 
Someday is never here.
By the time I get my way, 
I'll be neck deep in beer. 


Haydon! forgive me that I cannot speak
Definitively of these mighty things; 
Forgive me, that I have not eagle's wings,
That what I want I know not where to seek,
And think that I would not be over-meek,
In rolling out upfollowed thunderings,
Even to the steep of Heliconian springs,
Were I of ample strength for such a freak.
Think, too, that all these numbers should be thine; 
Whose else? In this who touch thy vesture's hem? 
For, when men stared at what was most divine
With brainless idiotism and o'erwise phlegm,
Thou hadst beheld the full Hesperian shine
Of their star in the east, and gone to worship them

I saw thee once- once only- years ago: 
I must not say how many- but not many. 
It was a July midnight; and from out 
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring, 
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven, 
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light, 
With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber, 
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand 
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden, 
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe- 
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses 
That gave out, in return for the love-light, 
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death- 
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses 
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted 
By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence. 
Clad all in white, upon a violet bank 
I saw thee half reclining; while the moon 
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses, 
And on thine own, upturn'd- alas, in sorrow! 

Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight- 
Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,) 
That bade me pause before that garden-gate, 
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses? 
No footstep stirred: the hated world an slept, 
How my heart beats in coupling those two words!) 
Save only thee and me. I paused- I looked- 
And in an instant all things disappeared. 
(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!) 


The pearly lustre of the moon went out: 
The mossy banks and the meandering paths, 
The happy flowers and the repining trees, 
Were seen no more: the very roses' odors 
Died in the arms of the adoring airs. 
All- all expired save thee- save less than thou: 
Save only the divine light in thine eyes- 
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes. 
I saw but them- they were the world to me! 
I saw but them- saw only them for hours, 
Saw only them until the moon went down. 
What wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten 
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres! 
How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope! 
How silently serene a sea of pride! 
How daring an ambition; yet how deep- 
How fathomless a capacity for love! 

But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight, 
Into a western couch of thunder-cloud; 
And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees 
Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained; 
They would not go- they never yet have gone; 
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night, 
They have not left me (as my hopes have) since; 
They follow me- they lead me through the years. 
They are my ministers- yet I their slave. 
Their office is to illumine and enkindle- 
My duty, to be saved by their bright light, 
And purified in their electric fire, 
And sanctified in their elysian fire. 
They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope), 
And are far up in Heaven- the stars I kneel to 
In the sad, silent watches of my night; 
While even in the meridian glare of day 
I see them still- two sweetly scintillant 
Venuses, unextinguished by the sun

Most truly honoured, and as truly dear, 
If worth in me or ought I do appear, 
Who can of right better demand the same 
Than may your worthy self from whom it came? 
The principal might yield a greater sum, 
Yet handled ill, amounts but to this crumb; 
My stock's so small I know not how to pay, 
My bond remains in force unto this day; 
Yet for part payment take this simple mite, 
Where nothing's to be had, kings loose their right. 
Such is my debt I may not say forgive, 
But as I can, I'll pay it while I live; 
Such is my bond, none can discharge but I, 
Yet paying is not paid until I die. 

Dear Sir of late delighted with the sight
Of your four Sisters cloth'd in black and white,
Of fairer Dames the Sun, ne'r saw the face;
Though made a pedestal for Adams Race;
Their worth so shines in these rich lines you show
Their paralels to finde I scarcely know
To climbe their Climes, I have nor strength nor skill
To mount so high requires an Eagles quill;
Yet view thereof did cause my thoughts to soar;
My lowly pen might wait upon these four
I bring my four times four, now meanly clad
To do their homage, unto yours, full glad:
Who for their Age, their worth and quality
Might seem of yours to claim precedency:
But by my humble hand, thus rudely pen'd
They are, your bounden handmaids to attend
These same are they, from whom we being have
These are of all, the Life, the Nurse, the Grave,
These are the hot, the cold, the moist, the dry,
That sink, that swim, that fill, that upwards fly,
Of these consists our bodies, Cloathes and Food,
The World, the useful, hurtful, and the good,
Sweet harmony they keep, yet jar oft times
Their discord doth appear, by these harsh rimes
Yours did contest for wealth, for Arts, for Age,
My first do shew their good, and then their rage.
My other foures do intermixed tell
Each others faults, and where themselves excell;
How hot and dry contend with moist and cold,
How Air and Earth no correspondence hold,
And yet in equal tempers, how they 'gree
How divers natures make one Unity
Something of all (though mean) I did intend
But fear'd you'ld judge Du Bartas was my friend
I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth
My goods are true (though poor) I love no stealth
But if I did I durst not send them you
Who must reward a Thief, but with his due.
I shall not need, mine innocence to clear
These ragged lines, will do't, when they appear:
On what they are, your mild aspect I crave
Accept my best, my worst vouchsafe a Grave.
From her that to your self, more duty owes
Then water in the boundess Ocean flows. 


This that you see, the false presentment planned
With finest art and all the colored shows
And reasonings of shade, doth but disclose
The poor deceits by earthly senses fanned!
Here where in constant flattery expand
Excuses for the stains that old age knows,
Pretexts against the years' advancing snows,
The footprints of old seasons to withstand; 


'Tis but vain artifice of scheming minds; 
'Tis but a flower fading on the winds; 
'Tis but a useless protest against Fate;
'Tis but stupidity without a thought, 
A lifeless shadow, if we meditate;
'Tis death, tis dust, tis shadow, yea, 'tis nought. 


Abeauteous princess often may
Languish in pleasure's season gay;
The empty forms of haughty state
Oft make life tedious to the great.
 
It must the greatest king confound,
With all his courtiers circled round,
Amidst a splendid court to find,
That grandeur can't give peace of mind.
 
Some think that play can give delight,
But soon it grows insipid quite;
And monarchs have been often seen,
While gaming, tortured with the spleen.
 
A king oft feasts with heavy heart,
Pleasures to him no joy impart;
While the dull vulgar contemplate,
Like gazing idiots, pomp and state,
 
And fondly think who is possessed
Of them with bliss supreme is blessed.
Soon as the sun's refulgent rays,
Spread o'er the hemisphere their blaze;
 
The king begins another day,
Yet knows not where to take his way:
Tired of himself he straight repairs
To company, to soothe his cares.
 
But pleasure flies from his embrace,
It rises not from change of place;
This day's insipid as the last,
At night he knows not how it passed.
 
Time's loss is not to be repaired,
Life's to an instant well compared;
What, when life posts away so fast,
Can days appear so long at last?
 
Princess, whose worth above thy age,
All hearts at two courts can engage;
You usefully that time employ,
By youth consumed in rapid joy.
 
The genius given by heaven benign,
You strive to polish and refine,
By studies which at once unite
Instructions solid, with delight.
 
'Tis best the mind should be employed,
Indolence leaves a craving void;
The soul is like a subtle fire,
Which if not fed must soon expire. 


There is no meaning in living — I don't say this.
There is meaning for some, may be for all — may be a perfect meaning.
Yet I hear the white sound of wind - driven birds 
In the water of the distant seas 
beneath the burning summer sun.


The candle burns slowly, very slowly, on my table; 
The books of intellect are more still—unwavering— lost in meditation; 
Yet when you go out on to the streets 
or even while sitting by the window side
Will you sense the frenzied dance of violent waters; 

Right beside that a book of your cheeks; no more like a lantern, 
Perhaps like a conch-shell lying on the beach as if ocean's father 
It is also a music by his own merit—like Nature: 
caustic—lovable—finally like the most favourite entity.

So I get the taste of expansive wind in the airing 
of maddening grievances; 
Otherwise in the mind's forest the python coils up around the doe: 
I feel the pitiable hint of a life like that in the Sceptre of protest.
Some glacier-cold still flock of Cormorants will realize my words; 
When the electric-compass of life will cease
They will eat up snow-grey sleep like polar seas in endless grasp.


Or ever did for my sake some good deed 
I will appear, looking such charity 
And kind compassion, at his life’s last need
That he will out of hand and heartily
Repent he sinned and all his sins be freed. 


Had we but World enough, and Time,
This coyness Lady were no crime.
We would sit down, and think which way
To walk, and pass our long Loves Day.
Thou by the Indian Ganges side.
Should'st Rubies find: I by the Tide
Of Humber would complain. I would
Love you ten years before the Flood:
And you should if you please refuse
Till the Conversion of the Jews.
My vegetable Love should grow
Vaster then Empires, and more slow.
An hundred years should go to praise
Thine Eyes, and on thy Forehead Gaze.
Two hundred to adore each Breast.
But thirty thousand to the rest.
An Age at least to every part,
And the last Age should show your Heart.
For Lady you deserve this State; 
Nor would I love at lower rate.
But at my back I alwaies hear
Times winged Charriot hurrying near:
And yonder all before us lye
Desarts of vast Eternity.
Thy Beauty shall no more be found; 
Nor, in thy marble Vault, shall sound
My ecchoing Song: then Worms shall try
That long preserv'd Virginity:
And your quaint Honour turn to durst; 
And into ashes all my Lust.
The Grave's a fine and private place,
But none I think do there embrace.
Now therefore, while the youthful hew
Sits on thy skin like morning glew,
And while thy willing Soul transpires
At every pore with instant Fires,
Now let us sport us while we may; 
And now, like am'rous birds of prey,
Rather at once our Time devour,
Than languish in his slow-chapt pow'r.
Let us roll all our Strength, and all
Our sweetness, up into one Ball:
And tear our Pleasures with rough strife,
Thorough the Iron gates of Life.
Thus, though we cannot make our Sun
Stand still, yet we will make him run.


"Come, pretty birds, present your lays,
     And learn to chaunt a goddess praise;
     Ye wood-nymphs, let your voices be
     Employ'd to serve her deity:
     And warble forth, ye virgins nine,
     Some music to my Valentine.

    "Her bosom is love's paradise,
     There is no heav'n but in her eyes;
     She's chaster than the turtle-dove,
     Yet all perfections do combine
     To beautifie my Valentine.

    "She's Nature's choicest cabinet,
     Where honour, beauty, worth and wit
     Are all united in her breast.
     The graces claim an interest:
     All virtues that are most divine
     Shine clearest in my Valentine

MY lute, awake! perform the last 
Labour that thou and I shall waste, 
   And end that I have now begun; 
For when this song is said and past, 
   My lute, be still, for I have done. 

As to be heard where ear is none, 
As lead to grave in marble stone, 
   My song may pierce her heart as soon: 
Should we then sing, or sigh, or moan? 
   No, no, my lute! for I have done. 

The rocks do not so cruelly 
Repulse the waves continually, 
   As she my suit and affectiòn; 
So that I am past remedy: 
   Whereby my lute and I have done. 

Proud of the spoil that thou hast got 
Of simple hearts thorough Love's shot, 
   By whom, unkind, thou hast them won; 
Think not he hath his bow forgot, 
   Although my lute and I have done. 

Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain, 
That makest but game of earnest pain: 
   Trow not alone under the sun 
Unquit to cause thy lover's plain, 
   Although my lute and I have done. 

May chance thee lie wither'd and old 
The winter nights that are so cold, 
   Plaining in vain unto the moon: 
Thy wishes then dare not be told: 
   Care then who list! for I have done. 

And then may chance thee to repent 
The time that thou has lost and spent 
   To cause thy lover's sigh and swoon: 
Then shalt thou know beauty but lent, 
   And wish and want as I have done. 

Now cease, my lute! this is the last 
Labour that thou and I shall waste, 
   And ended is that we begun: 
Now is this song both sung and past-- 
   My lute, be still, for I have done. 




Our times are much degenerate from those 
Which your sweet muse with your fair fortune chose, 
And as complexions alter with the climes, 
Our wits have drawn the infection of our times. 
That candid age no other way could tell 
To be ingenious, but by speaking well. 
Who best could praise had then the greatest praise, 
'Twas more esteemed to give than bear the bays: 
Modest ambition studied only then 
To honour not herself but worthy men. 
These virtues now are banished out of town, 
Our Civil Wars have lost the civic crown. 
He highest builds, who with most art destroys, 
And against others' fame his own employs. 
I see the envious caterpillar sit 
On the fair blossom of each growing wit. 

The air's already tainted with the swarms 
Of insects which against you rise in arms: 
Word-peckers, paper-rats, book-scorpions, 
Of wit corrupted, the unfashioned sons. 
The barbed censurers begin to look 
Like the grim consistory on thy book; 
And on each line cast a reforming eye, 
Severer than the young presbytery. 
Till when in vain they have thee all perused, 
You shall, for being faultless, be accused. 
Some reading your Lucasta will allege 
You wronged in her the House's privelege. 
Some that you under sequestration are, 
And one the book prohibits, because Kent 
Their first petition by the author sent. 

But when the beauteous ladies came to know 
That their dear Lovelace was endangered so: 
Lovelace that thawed the most congealed breast -- 
He who loved best and them defended best, 
Whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand, 
Whose hand most gently melts the lady's hand -- 
They all in mutiny though yet undressed 
Sallied, and would in his defence contest. 
And one, the loveliest that was yet e'er seen, 
Thinking that I too of the rout had been, 
Mine eyes invaded with a female spite, 
(She knew what pain 'twould cause to lose that sight.) 
`O no, mistake not,' I replied, `for I 
In your defence, or in his cause, would die.' 
But he, secure of glory and of time, 
Above their envy, or mine aid, doth climb. 
Him valiant'st men and fairest nymphs approve; 
His book in them finds judgement, with you love. 




Mortal my mate, bearing my rock-a-heart
Warm beat with cold beat company, shall I
Earlier or you fail at our force, and lie 
The ruins of, rifled, once a world of art? 
The telling time our task is; time’s some part,
Not all, but we were framed to fail and die— 
One spell and well that one. There, ah thereby
Is comfort’s carol of all or woe’s worst smart.

Field-flown, the departed day no morning brings 
Saying ‘This was yours’ with her, but new one, worse,
And then that last and shortest



Sit further, and make room for thine own fame,
Where just desert enrolles thy honour'd Name
The good Interpreter. Some in this task
Take of the Cypress vail, but leave a mask,
Changing the Latine, but do more obscure
That sence in English which was bright and pure.
So of Translators they are Authors grown,
For ill Translators make the Book their own.
Others do strive with words and forced phrase
To add such lustre, and so many rayes,
That but to make the Vessel shining, they
Much of the precious Metal rub away.
He is Translations thief that addeth more,
As much as he that taketh from the Store
Of the first Author. Here he maketh blots
That mends; and added beauties are but spots.
Caelia whose English doth more richly flow
Then Tagus, purer then dissolved snow,
And sweet as are her lips that speak it, she
Now learns the tongues of France and Italy;
But she is Caelia still: no other grace
But her own smiles commend that lovely face;
Her native beauty's not Italianated,
Nor her chast mind into the French translated:
Her thoughts are English, though her sparkling wit
With other Language doth them fitly fit.
Translators learn of her: but stay I slide
Down into Error with the Vulgar tide;
Women must not teach here: the Doctor doth
Stint them to Cawdles Almond-milk, and Broth.
Now I reform, and surely so will all
Whose happy Eyes on thy Translation fall,
I see the people hastning to thy Book,
Liking themselves the worse the more they look,
And so disliking, that they nothing see
Now worth the liking, but thy Book and thee.
And (if I Judgement have) I censure right;
For something guides my hand that I must write.
You have Translations statutes best fulfil'd.
That handling neither sully nor would guildbind your books
in crocodile skin

and then thereout
won't trouble therein



Standing aloof in giant ignorance, 
         Of thee I hear and of the Cyclades,
     As one who sits ashore and longs perchance
         To visit dolphin-coral in deep seas.
     So thou wast blind;--but then the veil was rent,
         For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live,
     And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent,
         And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive;
     Aye on the shores of darkness there is light,
         And precipices show untrodden green,
     There is a budding morrow in midnight,
         There is a triple sight in blindness keen;
     Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel


WHEN by my solitary hearth I sit,
      And hateful thoughts enwrap my soul in gloom;
When no fair dreams before my "mind's eye" flit,
      And the bare heath of life presents no bloom;
            Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,
            And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!

Whene'er I wander, at the fall of night,
      Where woven boughs shut out the moon's bright ray,
Should sad Despondency my musings fright,
      And frown, to drive fair Cheerfulness away,
            Peep with the moonbeams through the leafy roof,
            And keep that fiend Despondence far aloof!

Should Disappointment, parent of Despair,
      Strive for her son to seize my careless heart;
When, like a cloud, he sits upon the air,
      Preparing on his spell-bound prey to dart:
            Chase him away, sweet Hope, with visage bright,
            And fright him as the morning frightens night!

Whene'er the fate of those I hold most dear
      Tells to my fearful breast a tale of sorrow,
O bright-eyed Hope, my morbidfancy cheer;
      Let me awhile thy sweetest comforts borrow:
            Thy heaven-born radiance around me shed,
            And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!

Should e'er unhappy love my bosom pain,
      From cruel parents, or relentless fair;
O let me think it is not quite in vain
      To sigh out sonnets to the midnight air!
            Sweet Hope, ethereal balm upon me shed,
            And wave thy silver pinions o'er my head!

In the long vista of the years to roll,
      Let me not see our country's honour fade:
O let me see our land retain her soul,
      Her pride, her freedom; and not freedom's shade.
            From thy bright eyes unusual brightness shed---
            Beneath thy pinions canopy my head!

Let me not see the patriot's high bequest,
      Great Liberty! how great in plain attire!
With the base purple of a court oppress'd,
      Bowing her head, and ready to expire:
            But let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings
            That fill the skies with silver glitterings!

And as, in sparkling majesty, a star
      Gilds the bright summit of some gloomy cloud;
Brightening the half veil'd face of heaven afar:
      So, when dark thoughts my boding spirit shroud,
            Sweet Hope, celestial influence round me shed,
            Waving thy silver pinions o'er my head


Dark HORROR, hear my call!
 Stern Genius hear from thy retreat
 On some old sepulchre's moss-cankered seat,
Beneath the Abbey's ivied wall
 That trembles o'er its shade;
Where wrapt in midnight gloom, alone,
 Thou lovest to lie and hear
 The roar of waters near,
And listen to the deep dull groan
 Of some perturbed sprite
Borne fitful on the heavy gales of night.


Or whether o'er some wide waste hill
 Thou mark'st the traveller stray,
 Bewilder'd on his lonely way,
When, loud and keen and chill,
The evening winds of winter blow
Drifting deep the dismal snow.

Or if thou followest now on Greenland's shore,
 With all thy terrors, on the lonely way
Of some wrecked mariner, when to the roar
 Of herded bears the floating ice-hills round
 Pour their deep echoing sound,
 And by the dim drear Boreal light
Givest half his dangers to the wretches sight.


 Or if thy fury form,
   When o'er the midnight deep
   The dark-wing'd tempests sweep
 Watches from some high cliff the encreasing storm,
   Listening with strange delight
 As the black billows to the thunder rave
   When by the lightnings light
 Thou seest the tall ship sink beneath the wave.

 Dark HORROR! bear me where the field of fight
   Scatters contagion on the tainted gale,
   When to the Moon's faint beam,
 On many a carcase shine the dews of night
   And a dead silence stills the vale
Save when at times is heard the glutted Raven's scream.


Where some wreck'd army from the Conquerors might
Speed their disastrous flight,
 With thee fierce Genius! let me trace their way,
And hear at times the deep heart-groan
Of some poor sufferer left to die alone,
 His sore wounds smarting with the winds of night;
And we will pause, where, on the wild,
 The Mother to her frozen breast,
On the heap'd snows reclining clasps her child
 And with him sleeps, chill'd to eternal rest!


Black HORROR! speed we to the bed of Death,
 Where he whose murderous power afar
 Blasts with the myriad plagues of war,
Struggles with his last breath,
 Then to his wildly-starting eyes
 The phantoms of the murder'd rise,
 Then on his frenzied ear
Their groans for vengeance and the Demon's yell
In one heart-maddening chorus swell.
Cold on his brow convulsing stands the dew,
And night eternal darkens on his view.


HORROR! I call thee yet once more!
Bear me to that accursed shore
Where round the stake the impaled Negro writhes.
Assume thy sacred terrors then! dispense
The blasting gales of Pestilence!
Arouse the race of Afric! holy Power,
Lead them to vengeance! and in that dread hour
When Ruin rages wide
I will behold and smile by MERCY'S side. 


O YOUNG through all thy immemorial years! 
Rise, Mother, rise, regenerate from thy gloom, 
And, like a bride high-mated with the spheres, 
Beget new glories from thine ageless womb!


The nations that in fettered darkness weep 
Crave thee to lead them where great mornings break 
M
other, O Mother, wherefore dost thou sleep? 
Arise and answer for thy children's sake! 


Thy Future calls thee with a manifold sound 
To crescent honours, splendours, victories vast; 
Waken, O slumbering Mother and be crowned, 
Who once wert empress of the sovereign Past. 


To introduce myself to your story
It’s as the frightened hero 
If he touched with naked toe
A blade of territory

Prejudicial to glaciers I 
Know of no sin’s naivety 
Whose loud laugh of victory
You won’t have then denied

Say if I’m not filled with joyousness
Thunder and rubies to the hubs no less
To see in the air this fire is piercing

With royal kingdoms far scattering
The wheel crimson, as if in dying,
Of my chariot’s single evening. 



I.       Beneath the vine-clad eaves,
             Whose shadows fall before
             Thy lowly cottage door--
         Under the lilac's tremulous leaves--
         Within thy snowy clasped hand
             The purple flowers it bore.
         Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,
         Enchantress of the flowery wand,
             Most beauteous Isadore!

II.      And when I bade the dream
             Upon thy spirit flee,
             Thy violet eyes to me
         Upturned, did overflowing seem
         With the deep, untold delight
             Of Love's serenity;
         Thy classic brow, like lilies white
         And pale as the Imperial Night
         Upon her throne, with stars bedight,
             Enthralled my soul to thee!


III.     Ah! ever I behold
             Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
             Blue as the languid skies
         Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold;
         Now strangely clear thine image grows,
             And olden memories
         Are startled from their long repose
         Like shadows on the silent snows
         When suddenly the night-wind blows
             Where quiet moonlight lies.


IV.      Like music heard in dreams,
             Like strains of harps unknown,
             Of birds for ever flown,--
         Audible as the voice of streams
         That murmur in some leafy dell,
             I hear thy gentlest tone,
         And Silence cometh with her spell
         Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
         When tremulous in dreams I tell
             My love to thee alone!

V.       In every valley heard,
             Floating from tree to tree,
             Less beautiful to me,
         The music of the radiant bird,
         Than artless accents such as thine
             Whose echoes never flee!
         Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:--
         For uttered in thy tones benign
         (Enchantress!) this rude name of mine
             Doth seem a melody!



     .    .    .    .    .

Dear friend, forgive a wild lament
 Insanely following thy flight.
I would not cumber thine ascent
 Nor drag thee back into the night;

But the great sea-winds sigh with me,
 The fair-faced stars seem wrinkled, old,
And I would that I might lie with thee
 There in the grave so cold, so cold!

Grave walls are thick, I cannot see thee,
 And the round skies are far and steep;
A-wild to quaff some cup of Lethe,
 Pain is proud and scorns to weep.

My heart breaks if it cling about thee,
 And still breaks, if far from thine.
O drear, drear death, to live without thee,
 O sad life -- to keep thee mine.

     .    .    .    .    . 

The wind, that beats the mountain, blows
    More softly round the open wold,
  And gently comes the world to those 
    That are cast in gentle mould.
  And me this knowledge bolder made,
    Or else I had not dare to flow
  In these words toward you, and invade
    Even with a verse your holy woe.
  'Tis strange that those we lean on most,
   Those in whose laps our limbs are nursed,
 Fall into shadow, soonest lost:
   Those we love first are taken first.

   He lends us; but, when love is grown
 To ripeness, that on which it throve
   Falls off, and love is left alone.

 This is the curse of time. Alas!
   In grief I am not all unlearn'd;
 Once thro' mine own doors Death did pass;
   One went, who never hath return'd.

 He will not smile--not speak to me
   Once more. Two years his chair is seen
 Empty before us. That was he
   Without whose life I had not been.

 Your loss is rarer; for this star
   Rose with you thro' a little arc
 Of heaven, nor having wander'd far
   Shot on the sudden into dark.

 I knew your brother: his mute dust
   I honour and his living worth:
 A man more pure and bold and just
   Was never born into the earth.

 I have not look'd upon you nigh,
   Since that dear soul hath fall'n asleep.
 Great nature is more wise than I:
   I will not tell you not to weep.

 And tho' mine own eyes fill with dew,
   Drawn from the spirit thro' the brain,
 I will not even preach to you,
   "Weep, weeping dulls the inward pain




 Let Grief be her own mistress still.
   She loveth her own anguish deep
 More than much pleasure. Let her will
   Be done--to weep or not to weep.

   Of death is blown in every wind;"
 For that is not a common chance
   That takes away a noble mind.

 His memory long will live alone
   In all our hearts, as mournful light
 That broods above the fallen sun,
   And dwells in heaven half the night.

 Vain solace! Memory standing near
   Cast down her eyes, and in her throat
 Her voice seem'd distant, and a tear
   Dropt on the letters as I wrote.

 I wrote I know not what. In truth,
   How should I soothe you anyway,
 Who miss the brother of your youth?
   Yet something I did wish to say:

 For he too was a friend to me:
   Both are my friends, and my true breast
 Bleedeth for both: yet it may be
   That only silence suiteth best.

 Words weaker than your grief would make
   Grief more. 'Twere better I should cease;
 Although myself could almost take
   The place of him that sleeps in peace.

 Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace;
   Sleep, holy spirit, blessed soul,
 While the stars burn, the moons increase,
   And the great ages onward roll.

 Sleep till the end, true soul and sweet.
   Nothing comes to thee new or strange,
 Sleep full of rest from head to feet:
   Lie still, dry dust, secure of change. 


Boswell - you old rake - I have tried to imitate
your style; but it is no use; my dialogues are
all between my selves: and though I sit up late,
make endless notes and jottings that I hope will jar
my memory - it is in vain - for in the end
I have no Dr. Johnson but myself.


The difference is (I think) between our lives. You spend
the morning at the coffee house, nourish yourself
with talk and kippers before proceeding on to dine.
A ramble across London perks the appetite.
Every step is an adventure; the written line
distills itself from life. How can you help but write?

I consort with books while you see men, haunt the shelves
where your London lies buried. Your book once opened,
I become the ghost, a pale phantom who delves
into your life to borrow moments penned
two hundred years ago. I roam your world ignored -
while my own life, waiting outside, questions my motives.


A man should never live more than he can record
you say; but what if he records more than he lives?
My journal swarms with me and even I am bored.
I am all my personae - children, lovers, wives,
philosophers and country-wenches. Though I give them
different robes and wigs to wear, all converse alike;
all reason falsely with the same stratagem;
each suspects the logic of the other, dislikes
him, yet cannot prove him wrong. Petty cavils
grow to monstrous issues, belabored arguments
resolve themselves only in sleep; darkness prevails.
Only the living find solace in common sense.


Safe, preserved from the rape of the world, I grow
dishonest, and pen my crooked words, for one can lie
with ease about those things the world will never know.
Conversation - that clearinghouse for thoughts - denied,
the mind gets gouty and the conscience needs a cane.
Notions unuttered seem to echo through the brain -
and our monologues are doomed to the same end.
We all think better - interrupted by a friend. 




Yours is a garden of old-fashioned flowers;
Joyous children delight to play there;
Weary men find rest in its bowers,
Watching the lingering light of day there.

Old-time tunes and young love's laughter
Ripple and run among the roses;
Memory's echoes, murmuring after,
Fill the dusk when the long day closes.

Simple songs with a cadence olden--
These you learned in the Forest of Arden:
Friendly flowers with hearts all golden--
These you borrowed from Eden's garden.

This is the reason why all men love you;
Truth to life is the charm of art:
Other poets may soar above you--
You keep close to the human heart. 


Good-bye! a kind good-bye,
I bid you now, my friend,
And though 'tis sad to speak the word,
To destiny I bend

And though it be decreed by Fate
That we ne'er meet again,
Your image, graven on my heart,
Forever shall remain.

Aye, in my heart thoult have a place,
Among the friends held dear,-
Nor shall the hand of Time efface
The memories written there.



 that a week could be an age, and we
Felt parting and warm meeting every week,
Then one poor year a thousand years would be,
The flush of welcome ever on the cheek:
So could we live long life in little space,
So time itself would be annihilate,
So a day's journey in oblivious haze
To serve ourjoys would lengthen and dilate.
O to arrive each Monday morn from Ind!
To land each Tuesday from the rich Levant!
In little time a host of joys to bind,
And keep our souls in one eternal pant!
This morn, my friend, and yester-evening taught
Me how to harbour such a happy thought. 


Great master! Boyish, sympathetic man! 
Whose orbed and ripened genius lightly hung 
From life's slim, twisted tendril and there swung 
In crimson-sphered completeness; guardian 
Of crystal portals through whose openings fan 
The spiced winds which blew when earth was young, 
Scattering wreaths of stars, as Jove once flung 
A golden shower from heights cerulean. 
Crumbled before thy majesty we bow. 
Forget thy empurpled state, thy panoply 
Of greatness, and be merciful and near; 
A youth who trudged the highroad we tread now 
Singing the miles behind him; so may we 
Faint throbbings of thy music overhear. 




Knowing our lives a drowse
towards death
(attended by dogs
& children)
how can it not matter
that I remember
(day after day)
that one day
we shall lose
each other,
lose the lights
in each other's eyes
to death,
& drift off
to other universes.


Love shall not save us
from being alone at the end,
& the daughter we made
in that fine high exuberance
of having found each other
shall not save us either.


We shall go off
into the ether alone,
trying to remember
(as the threads unravel
& the brain cells turn
to fluffy cumulus clouds)

that on clear October days
like this one,
when the hills were
red with maple,
gold with oak,
we bumped along in the Jeep
reminding each other:
'Wake up! Wake up!
This will not last forever!


'Long had I loved this "Attic shape," the brede 
Of marble maidens round this urn divine:
But when your golden voice began to read,
The empty urn was filled with Chian wine. 

Still must the poet as of old, 
In barren attic bleak and cold, 
Starve, freeze, and fashion verses to 
Such things as flowers and song and you;

Still as of old his being give 
In Beauty's name, while she may live, 
Beauty that may not die as long 
As there are flowers and you and song. 


Rays of glorious optimism; to kill the treacherously ghastly darkness of the sullen night, 

Avalanches of tantalizing mysticism; to kill dreadful chapters of fetidly rotting monotony, 

Dewdrops of philanthropic benevolence; to kill the bloody war of indiscriminate hatred, 

Pearls of perpetual wisdom; to kill the famished tyranny of hopelessly debilitating illiteracy, 

Cloudbursts of rhapsodic fantasy; to kill the painstaking agony of mutilating boredom, 

Fountains of mesmerizing scent; to kill the disdainfully traumatic odor of manipulative prejudice, 

Tornados of Herculean strength; to kill devastating laziness; slithering baselessly on chocolate brown wisps of mundane soil, 

Fabulously sweet cocoons of honey; to kill ruthless animosity; parasitically sucking 
all tribes, 

Fireballs of untamed passion; to kill cold blooded frigidity; irrevocably refusing the web of mystique and love, 

Mountains of astronomical conviction; to kill disastrous diffidence; deluged perennially in mournful remorse, 

Rainshowers of irrefutable truth; to kill satanic chains of hideously ostentatious lies, 
Swords of patriotic triumph; to kill traitors beheading their divinely sacrosanct motherland, 

Volcano's of unprecedented ecstasy; to kill self inflicted wounds of gory sorrow; tumultuously proliferating after caressing land, 

Winds of insurmountable ambition; to kill utterly nonchalant staring into murky space; for centuries immemorial, 

Voices of impeccably boisterous activity; to kill everlasting hours of compellingly abominable sleep, 
Nostalgic reflections of childhood; to kill inevitably advancing age; and the fear of relinquishing all energy, 

Romantic clouds of majestic art; to kill savage corruption and irate blasphemy of the living; in the stringently conventional society, 

Perpetually augmenting thunderbolts of love; to kill insidiously capricious and perilous hatred, 


You really have to be a notoriously cruel criminal 
To kill a Poet, a gentle person, an earth angel, 
Who is not afraid to continually tell it like it is.
The Poet always tells the whole truth, at ease.
He neither fears the daily danger nor the deadly fire.
He wants to make the entire darn world a better
Place for every beings under the hot and cold sun.

You really have to be seriously stupid and dumb
To prosecute somebody who can put the moon
On your plate, somebody who can nourish your numb
Soul, your broken heart, and your sick and sad emotions.

You really have to be strange to hate somebody, 
Who loves you unconditionally and who has no envy
Of your ill-gotten amenities or your earthy possessions.

You really have to be awkward to hurt an earthly saint, 
Who wants to share his knowledge and who wants to paint 
Mother Nature the way she is. The Poet wants to expose the lies, 
The myths, the innuendoes, the unfairness and the injustice, 
So we all can finally find the prairie and the oasis of peace.

You really have to hate yourself to want to hurt so many Poets, 
So many outstanding citizens of the world, who just paid your debts. 


Thou that wast once my loved and loving friend,
A friend no more, I had forgot thee quite,
Why hast thou come to trouble my delight
With memories ? Oh ! I had clean made end
Of all that time, I had made haste to send
My soul into red places, and to light
A torch of pleasure to burn up my night.
What I have woven hast thou come to rend ?

In silent acres of forgetful flowers,
Crowned as of old with happy daffodils,
Long time my wounded soul has been a-straying,
Alas! it has chanced now on sombre hours
Of hard remembrances and sad delaying,
Leaving green valleys for the bitter hills


To Ladies' eyes a round, boy, 
We can't refuse, we can't refuse; 
Though bright eyes so abound, boy, 
'Tis hard to choose, 'tis hard to choose. 
For thick as stars that lighten 
Yon airy bowers, yon airy bowers, 
The countless eyes that brighten 
This earth of ours, this earth of ours. 
But fill the cup -- where'er, boy, 
Our choice may fall, our choice may fall, 
We're sure to find Love there, boy, 
So drink them all! so drink them all! 

Some looks there are so holy, 
They seem but given, they seem but given, 
As shining beacons, solely, 
To light to heaven, to light to heaven, 
While some -- oh! ne'er believe them -- 
With tempting ray, with tempting ray, 
The other way, the other way. 
But fill the cup -- where'er, boy, 
Our choice may fall, our choice may fall, 
We're sure to find Love there, boy; 
So drink them all! so drink them all! 

In some, as in a mirror, 
Love seems pourtray'd, Love seems pourtray'd, 
But shun the flattering error, 
'Tis but his shade, 'tis but his shade. 
Himself has fix'd his dwelling 
In eyes we know, in eyes we know, 
And lips -- but this is telling -- 
So here they go! so here they go! 
Fill up, fill up -- where'er, boy, 
Our choice may fall, our choice may fall, 
We're sure to find Love there, boy; 
So drink them all ! so drink them all


A stream to mingle with your favorite Dee
Along the Vale of Meditation flows;
So styled by those fierce Britons, pleased to see
In Nature's face the expression of repose,
Or, haply there some pious Hermit chose
To live and die -- the peace of Heaven his aim,
To whome the wild sequestered region owes
At this late day, its sanctifying name.
Glyn Cafaillgaroch, in the Cambrian tongue,
In ourse the Vale of Friendship, let this spot
Be nam'd, where faithful to a low roof'd Cot
On Deva's banks, ye have abode so long,
Sisters in love, a love allowed to climb
Ev'n on this earth, above the reach of time. 


It's to late, 
this force is far too great, 
we've fallen in love, 
too late in life, 
our courage is crushed, 
our bravery baffled, 
our energy eradacated, 
our spirit stolen, 
and our time almost through, 
so why oh why am I in love with you


to live them, hard.
The search for the Real
is no simple matter.


Deep in my looking,
the last words vanished.
Joyous and silent,
the waking that met me there. 


This is the city to walk around in the rain 
Staring at the barges in the harbor 
And to hum songs through the night. 
The city has countless streets 
Bustling with people running around.  
The waitress who brings me my tea every evening 
And whom I like a lot although she's a White Russian 
Is in this city. 


The old pianist who turns around 
To look at me 
When he sneaks in pieces by Schumann and Brahms 
While playing waltzes and foxtrot 
Is also in this city. 

The ferry boats that caryy passengers 
To the village where I was born are in this city. 
So are my memories, 
All those I love, 
And the graves of my loved ones. 

This is the city where I have a job, 
Where I earn my bread money. 
And yet, in spite of all this, 
This is the same city I'm leaving 
Because of a woman 
In another city. 


I walk down the filthy streets of the Bronx. 
They want my money and they want my soul. 
I pull a tissue from my pocket to wipe the soot from my burning eyes, 
and red pills fall to the ground, They sparkle under the filthy neon haze 
I move on, unaware of my loss.
In an instant, a shadow darts from out of the darkness, claiming the booty and 
disappearing into the filth. 
Tonite, he may believe he is in ecstasy! 
but in fact, he will never be constipated again. 


Lily, Lily! I am sighing
With despair and hopeless woe.
I’m tormented and I’m dying,
And my soul has lost its glow,
But my love evoked no pity:
You consider me pathetic.
Keep on laughing: you are pretty
Even when unsympathetic. 

A sweet plaintive song did I hear,
And I fancied that she was the singer—
May emotions as pure, as that song set a-stir
Be the worst that the future shall bring her. 


I 

I know, it is not easy to live, 
To give your heart and sing about your darling; 
To walk around at nights under the light of stars, 
And to feel warm under the sunlight during the day; 
To find an oportunity for half a day and, 
To be able to sit back on the Çamlıca hill.  
-Thousand tones of blue flow through the Bosphorus- 
To be able to forget everything in the blues. 

II 

I know, it is not easy to live; 
But you see 
The bed of a dead man is still warm, 
The wrist watch is still working on another. 
Living is not easy fellows, but, 
Neither is to die; 

It is not easy to leave this world. 



To lie back under the tallest 
oldest trees. How far the stems 
rise, rise 
before ribs of shelter 
open! 


sentence too adequate, has no give. 
Awe, not comfort. Stone, elbows of 
stony wood beneath lenient 
moss bed. 


And awe suddenly 
passing beyond itself. Becomes 
a form of comfort. 
Becomes the steady 
air you glide on, arms 
stretched like the wings of flying foxes. 

To hear the multiple silence 
of trees, the rainy 
forest depths of their listening. 


To float, upheld, 
as salt water 
would hold you, 
once you dared. 




To feel vibrate the enraptured 

waterfall flinging itself 
unabating down and down 
to clenched fists of rock. 
Swiftness of plunge, 
hour after year after century, 
O or Ah 
uninterrupted, voice 
many-stranded. 
To breathe 
spray. The smoke of it. 
Arcs 
of steelwhite foam, glissades 
of fugitive jade barely perceptible. 



Such passion— 
rage or joy? 
Thus, not mild, not temperate, 
flood of mercy 
flung on resistance. 


I held myself too open, I forgot
that outside not just things exist and animals
fully at ease in themselves, whose eyes
reach from their lives' roundedness no differently
than portraits do from frames; forgot that I
with all I did incessantly crammed
looks into myself; looks, opinion, curiosity.
Who knows: perhaps eyes form in space
and look on everywhere. Ah, only plunged toward you
does my face cease being on display, grows
into you and twines on darkly, endlessly,
into your sheltered heart.


As one puts a handkerchief before pent-in-breath-
no: as one presses it against a wound
out of which the whole of life, in a single gush,
wants to stream, I held you to me: I saw you 
turn red from me. How could anyone express
what took place between us? We made up for everything
there was never time for. I matured strangely
in every impulse of unperformed youth,
and you, love, had wildest childhood over my heart.


Memory won't suffice here: from those moments
there must be layers of pure existence
on my being's floor, a precipitate
from that immensely overfilled solution.

For I don't think back; all that I am
stirs me because of you. I don't invent you
at sadly cooled-off places from which
you've gone away; even your not being there
is warm with you and more real and more
than a privation. Longing leads out too often
into vagueness. Why should I cast myself, when,
for all I know, your influence falls on me,
gently, like moonlight on a window seat.




Searing is the pain torn deeply, my soul
And often the memories rain fire
As if just the thought of you drew ire
From unknown keepers of my heart's control

There are times I slip into a madness
Wishing I had never found love in you
But, even if that wish were truly true
What would a wish do to heal my sadness

No, even if it were to repair much
That wish would, alas, be very untrue
To love is to always remember you
Love would be void if I forgot your touch

Sadly sit I dreaming us as one
As my thoughts on love are slowly undone



Away from thee;
Or that when I am gone,
You or I were alone, - 
Then, my Lucasta, might I crave
Pity from blust'ring wind or swallowing wave.

But I'll not sigh one blast or gale
To swell my sail,
Or pay a tear to 'suage
The foaming blue god's rage;
For whether he will let me pass
Or no, I'm still as happy as I was.

Though seas and land betwixt us both,
Our faith and troth,
Like separated souls,
All time and space controls:
Above the highest sphere we meet
Unseen, unknown, and greet as angels greet.

So then we do anticipate
Our after-fate,
And are alive i'th' skies,
If thus our lips and eyes
Can speak like spirits unconfined
In Heaven, their earthy bodies left behind. 


Tell me not (Sweet) I am unkind,
    That from the nunnery
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
    To war and arms I fly.

True, a new mistress now I chase,
    The first foe in the field;
And with a stronger faith embrace
    A sword, a horse, a shield.

Yet this inconstancy is such
    As you too shall adore;
I could not love thee (Dear) so much,
    Lov'd I not Honour more. 


Lucasta, frown, and let me die, 
But smile, and see, I live; 
The sad indifference of your eye 
Both kills and doth reprieve. 
You hide our fate within its screen; 
We feel our judgment, ere we hear. 
So in one picture I have seen 
An angel here, the devil there. 


O! I care not that my earthly lot
        Hath little of Earth in it,
      That years of love have been forgot
        In the fever of a minute:

      I heed not that the desolate
        Are happier, sweet, than I,
      But that you meddle with my fate
        Who am a passer by.

      It is not that my founts of bliss
        Are gushing- strange! with tears-
      Or that the thrill of a single kiss
        Hath palsied many years-

      'Tis not that the flowers of twenty springs
        Which have wither'd as they rose
      Lie dead on my heart-strings
        With the weight of an age of snows.

      Not that the grass- O! may it thrive!
        On my grave is growing or grown-
      But that, while I am dead yet alive
        I cannot be, lady, alone. 


Of all who hail thy presence as the morning-
     Of all to whom thine absence is the night-
     The blotting utterly from out high heaven
     The sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee
     Hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all,
     For the resurrection of deep-buried faith
     In Truth- in Virtue- in Humanity-
     Of all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed
     Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
     At thy soft-murmured words, "Let there be light!"
     At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
     In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-
     Of all who owe thee most- whose gratitude
     Nearest resembles worship- oh, remember
     The truest- the most fervently devoted,
     And think that these weak lines are written by him-
     By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
     His spirit is communing with an angel's. 


Take a newspaper.
Take some scissors.
Choose from this paper an article the length you want to make your poem.
Cut out the article.
Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them all in a bag.
Shake gently.
Next take out each cutting one after the other.
Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
The poem will resemble you.
And there you are--an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd. 


In this gigantic dome of time 
Often with a suspicious mind  
Bell tolls and we hear  a chime 
To mankind New Year be kind
 
Step by step ahead we move
Astride our dreams and hopes
And finding our life's groove
March on and on lest it elopes  

Let's wish our nears and dears
Health, Wealth & Happiness
In a wonder  world  of cheers

Let peace be rehabilitated
May diabolic designs crumble  
Let terrorists be debilitated


Shape our dreams to march on evergreen; 
make it all seasons of spring. 
Make it flutter on sun’s eventide 
with strong shoulder blade to glide. 
Let’s stitch some flowers, weave images to shower, 
sew little phrases and few profound verses, 
and cast them in the ocean of leaves. 
Let it float; let it swim 
through the waves of seven seas. 
Let it dance; let it sing in mellifluous symphony. 
The trumpets will propel them beyond our time.
Dreams alive; dreams survive in veracity - our legacy

Of all who hail thy presence as the morning-
Of all to whom thine absence is the night-
The blotting utterly from out high heaven
The sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee
Hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all,
For the resurrection of deep-buried faith
In Truth- in Virtue- in Humanity-
Of all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed
Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
At thy soft-murmured words, 'Let there be light!'
At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-
Of all who owe thee most- whose gratitude
Nearest resembles worship- oh, remember
The truest- the most fervently devoted,
And think that these weak lines are written by him-
By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
His spirit is communing with an angel's. 


Let other bards of angels sing, 
Bright suns without a spot; 
But thou art no such perfect thing: 
Rejoice that thou art not! 

Heed not tho' none should call thee fair; 
So, Mary, let it be 
If nought in loveliness compare 
With what thou art to me. 

True beauty dwells in deep retreats, 
Whose veil is unremoved 
Till heart with heart in concord beats, 
And the lover is beloved. 


I seem, in the midst of the crowd,
The lightest of all;
My laughter rings cheery and loud,
In banquet and ball.
My lip hath its smiles and its sneers,
For all men to see;
But my soul, and my truth, and my tears,
Are for thee, are for thee!

Around me they flatter and fawn—
The young and the old.
The fairest are ready to pawn
Their hearts for my gold.
They sue me—I laugh as I spurn
The slaves at my knee;
But in faith and in fondness I turn
Unto thee, unto thee

Had I a man's fair form, then might my sighs
Be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell,
Thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well
Would passion arm me for the enterprise:
But ah! I am no knight whose foeman dies;
No cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell;
I am no happy shepherd of the dell
Whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes.
Yet must I dote upon thee,—call thee sweet,
Sweeter by far than Hybla's honied roses
When steeped in dew rich to intoxication.
Ah! I will taste that dew, for me 'tis meet,
And when the moon her pallid face discloses,
I'll gather some by spells, and incantation. 

To me at my fifth-floor window
The chimney-pots in rows
Are sets of pipes pandean
For every wind that blows;

And the smoke that whirls and eddies
In a thousand times and keys
Is really a visible music
Set to my reveries.

O monstrous pipes, melodious
With fitful tune and dream,
The clouds are your only audience,
Her thought is your only theme

Family to me has many meanings
For all are full of diverse feelings
Love and anger, both within a single one
Children who stay and children who run
Can one family be better than another? 
It all depends on how they love each other
A family’s love should last forever
Bonds of love nothing can sever
For the family I have, I am happy and blessed
And nothing more truthful have I ever confessed
Family has many meanings, but one rises above
The greatest meaning of family, is that of love


Strange Power, I know not what thou art, 
Murderer or mistress of my heart. 
I know I'd rather meet the blow 
Of my most unrelenting foe 
Than live---as now I live---to be 
Slain twenty times a day by thee. 

Yet, when I would command thee hence, 
Thou mockest at the vain pretence, 
Murmuring in mine ear a song 
Once loved, alas! forgotten long; 
And on my brow I feel a kiss 
That I would rather die than miss. 


MILTON! I think thy spirit hath passed away
            From these white cliffs, and high-embattled towers;
            This gorgeous fiery-coloured world of ours
          Seems fallen into ashes dull and grey,
          And the age changed unto a mimic play
            Wherein we waste our else too-crowded hours:
            For all our pomp and pageantry and powers
          We are but fit to delve the common clay,
          Seeing this little isle on which we stand,
            This England, this sea-lion of the sea,
            By ignorant demagogues is held in fee,
            Which bare a triple empire in her hand


The moon renounced to dawn and vanish its waning shine.
She conceded one fray to lose, to win another gasp of time.

Reflection seen on the streams of swirling pools, 
There a shadow was hidden behind the twigs of wood keens.

Moon played the strings mellow yet deceiving 
As jackals’ lingered for a big gorge at herald’s wave.

Pool within pool, snare within snare, a quick mud
Beyond the desire touch, Venus fly trap sneaks on ground. 


O holy virgin! clad in purest white,
Unlock heav'n's golden gates, and issue forth;
Awake the dawn that sleeps in heaven; let light
Rise from the chambers of the east, and bring
The honey'd dew that cometh on waking day.
O radiant morning, salute the sun
Rous'd like a huntsman to the chase, and with
Thy buskin'd feet appear upon our hills. 


Cyriack, this three years day these eys, though clear
To outward view, of blemish or of spot;
Bereft of light thir seeing have forgot,
Nor to thir idle orbs doth sight appear
Of Sun or Moon or Starre throughout the year,
Or man or woman.  Yet I argue not
Against heavns hand or will, nor bate a jot
Of heart or hope; but still bear vp and steer
Right onward.  What supports me, dost thou ask?
The conscience, Friend, to have lost them overply'd                  
In libertyes defence, my noble task,
Of which all Europe talks from side to side.
This thought might lead me through the world's vain mask
Content though blind, had I no better guide. 


No sooner, FLAVIO, was you gone, 
But, your Injunction thought upon,
 ARDELIA took the Pen; 
Designing to perform the Task,
Her FLAVIO did so kindly ask,
 Ere he returned agen. 

Unto Parnassus strait she sent, 
And bid the Messenger, that went
 Unto the Muses Court,
Assure them, she their Aid did need,
And begg'd they'd use their utmost Speed,
 Because the Time was short. 

The hasty Summons was allow'd;
And being well-bred, they rose and bow'd,
 And said, they'd poste away;
That well they did ARDELIA know,
And that no Female's Voice below
 They sooner wou'd obey: 

That many of that rhiming Train,
On like Occasions, sought in vain
 Their Industry t'excite;
But for ARDELIA all they'd leave:
Thus flatt'ring can the Muse deceive,
 And wheedle us to write. 

Yet, since there was such haste requir'd;
To know the Subject 'twas desir'd,
 On which they must infuse;
That they might temper Words and Rules,
And with their Counsel carry Tools,
 As Country-Doctors use. 

Wherefore to cut off all Delays,
'Twas soon reply'd, a Husband's Praise
 (Tho' in these looser Times)
ARDELIA gladly wou'd rehearse
A Husband's, who indulg'd her Verse,
 And now requir'd her Rimes. 

A Husband! eccho'd all around:
And to Parnassus sure that Sound
 Had never yet been sent;
Amazement in each Face was read,
In haste th'affrighted Sisters fled, 
 And unto Council went. 


Erato cry'd, since Grizel's Days,
Since Troy-Town pleas'd, and Chivey-chace,
 No such Design was known;
And 'twas their Bus'ness to take care,
It reach'd not to the publick Ear,
 Or got about the Town: 

Nor came where Evening Beaux were met
O'er Billet-doux and Chocolate,
 Lest it destroy'd the House;
For in that Place, who cou'd dispence
(That wore his Cloaths with common Sense)
 With mention of a Spouse? 

'Twas put unto the Vote at last,
And in the Negative it past,
 None to her Aid shou'd move;
Yet since ARDELIA was a Friend,
Excuses 'twas agreed to send,
 Which plausible might prove: 

That Pegasus of late had been 
So often rid thro' thick and thin,
 With neither Fear nor Wit;
In Panegyrick been so spurr'd 
He cou'd not from the Stall be stirr'd,
 Nor wou'd endure the Bit. 

Melpomene had given a Bond, 
By the new House alone to stand,
 And write of War and Strife;
Thalia, she had taken Fees,
And Stipends from the Patentees,
 And durst not for her Life. 

Urania only lik'd the Choice; 
Yet not to thwart the publick Voice,
 She whisp'ring did impart:
They need no Foreign Aid invoke,
No help to draw a moving Stroke,
 Who dictate from the Heart. 

Enough! the pleas'd ARDELIA cry'd;
And slighting ev'ry Muse beside,
 Consulting now her Breast,
Perceiv'd that ev'ry tender Thought,
Which from abroad she'd vainly sought,
 Did there in Silence rest: 

And shou'd unmov'd that Post maintain,
Till in his quick Return again,
 Met in some neighb'ring Grove,
(Where Vice nor Vanity appear)
Her FLAVIO them alone might hear,
 In all the Sounds of Love. 

For since the World do's so despise
Hymen's Endearments and its Ties, 
 They shou'd mysterious be;
Till We that Pleasure too possess
(Which makes their fancy'd Happiness)
 Of stollen Secrecy. 



The full extremes of nature's force we find:
How heavenly virtue can exalt, or rage
Infernal how degrade the human mind.

While the fierce monk does at his trial stand,
He chews revenge, abjuring his offence:
Guile in his tongue, and murder in his hand, 
He stabs his judge, to prove his innocence.

The guilty stroke and torture of the steel
Infix'd, our dauntless Briton scarce perceives:
The wounds his country from his death must feel,
The patriot views; for those alone he grieves.

The barbarous rage that durst attempt thy life, 
Harley, great counsellor, extends thy fame;
And the sharp point of cruel Guiscard's knife,
In brass and marble carves thy deathless name.

Faithful assertor of thy country's cause,
Britain with tears shall bathe thy glorious wound;
She for thy safety shall enlarge her laws,
And in her statutes shall thy worth be found.

Yet 'midst her sighs she triumphs on the hand
Reflecting, that diffused the public wo;
A stranger to her altars, and her land;
No son of hers could meditate this bow,

Meantime thy pain is gracious Anna's are:
Softens thy anguish: in her powerful prayer
She pleads thy service, and forbids thy death.

Great as thou art, thou canst demand no more,
O breast bewail'd by earth, preserved by Heaven?
No higher can aspiring virtue soar:
Enough to thee of grief and fame is given. 


Success to James Scrymgeour,
He's a very good man,
And to gainsay it,
There's few people can; 

Because he makes the hearts
Of the poor o'erjoyed
By trying to find work for them
When they're unemployed. 

And to their complaints
He has always an attentive ear,
And ever ready to help them
When unto him they draw near. 

And no matter what your occupation is.
Or what is your creed.
He will try to help you
In the time of need; 

Because he has the fear
Always takes the poor's part. 

And blessed is the man
That is kind to the poor;
For his reward in heaven,

And I hope heaven will be
Mr James Sctymgeour's reward;
For his struggles on behalf of the poor
Are really vexatious and hard. 

For he is to be seen daily
Walking along our streets,
And a kind word to all he meets. 

Besides, he is void of all pride,
And wouldn't feel ashamed
To be seen with a beggar
Or a tinker walking by his side. 

Fellow-citizens of Dundee,
Isn't it really very nice
To think of James Scrymgeour trying
To rescue fallen creatures from the paths of vice? 

And in the winter he tries to provide
Hot dinners for the poor children of Dundee,
Who are starving with hunger no doubt,
And in the most abject poverty. 

He is a little deaf, no doubt,
But not deaf to the cries of hungry men,
No! he always tries to do his best
To procure bread for them. 

And at the Sabbath-morning free-breakfasts
He is often seen there,
Administering to the wants of the hungry,
And joining in prayer. 

He is a man of noble principles,
As far as can think,
And the noblest principle he has got
Is, he abhors the demon drink. 

And, in my opinion, he is right
As far as I can see,
And I hereby proclaim that such a man
Is an honour to Dundee: 

Because he is always working
For the poor people's good.
Kind soul, trying hard
To procure for them clothing and food 

Success to him and his family.
Why? fellow citizens of Dundee,
Because he is the poor man's friend. 

Cat! who hast pass’d thy grand climacteric,
How many mice and rats hast in thy days
Destroy’d? How many tit bits stolen? Gaze
With those bright languid segments green, and prick
Those velvet ears - but pr’ythee do not stick
Thy latent talons in me - and upraise
Thy gentle mew - and tell me all thy frays,
Of fish and mice, and rats and tender chick.
Nay, look not down, nor lick thy dainty wrists -
For all thy wheezy asthma - and for all
Thy tail’s tip is nick’d off - and though the fists
Of many a maid have given thee many a maul,
Still is that fur as soft, as when the lists
In youth thou enter’dest on glass bottled wall. 

Music: breathing of statues. Perhaps:
silence of paintings. You language where all language
ends. You time
standing vertically on the motion of mortal hearts.

Feelings for whom? O you the transformation
of feelings into what?--: into audible landscape.
You stranger: music. You heart-space
grown out of us. The deepest space in us,
which, rising above us, forces its way out,--
holy departure:
when the innermost point in us stands
outside, as the most practiced distance, as the other
side of the air:
pure,
boundless,
no longer habitable.




Somewhere in a strange land
An unknown heart throbs for me
Etching an amorous graffiti
On the blank walls of my mind
Where ever I am, I feel a pair of eyes 
Fondly surveying and scanning me, 
Speaking to me in silence
And keeps me awake in the night
I feel it all, I hear it all
Filling me with a sweet ache! 

When night birds croon in the woods
And their mates answer the serenade, 
When the moon begins her somnambulistic walk
And light beams percolate through pine needles, 
When a hundred eyes open in the blue heights
To watch over the sleeping Earth, 
When the whistle of a train is heard far away
And its music wanes into a monotonous drone, 
When the rooster makes his first clarion call
Breaking the serene silence of the night, 
When glow worms float in darkness
Like cruise ships over the sea, 
When night gales shake the slender coniferous trees
And wind whistles among their leaves, 
When sailing clouds blind the stars
And the night turns into an ebony shade, 
When the opening Jasmine secretly exults
In her own exotic scent, 


Sitting in my dimly lighted room
I draft this message of love
Pouring all my warmth into it
Thus emptying my love laden heart
That blazes with the fire of love
And encode it in cryptic script
To be mailed to you, my love! 

Oh, it might take much time
Better it be a whispered endearment
Sent through this perfumed night breeze
That shall carry it from this end to that end

So kindly leave your window open!

In our way to paradise. 

O my Cutie, you are the beauty
I searched until now
I came across you.

O my Cutie, you are the beauty
I dreamt ever and ever.
Giver gives me
To keep in touch
And forget never.

O my Cutie, you are the beauty
 To paint in my heart 
I tried thousand times.
Passed sleepless night
To write a few lines.

O my Cutie, you are the beauty
That keeps me alive
To have a sight
Makes me a dreamer
In broad day light.

O my Cutie, you are the beauty
 In seas of trouble 
That keeps away my pain
In the hottest day of summer
Gives me coolest rain.

O my Cutie, you are the beauty
 Be my wife now 
Listen to my last wish 
Be my comrade
In our way to paradise. 


To touch you is impossible, 
I hope you understand, 
I was so scared, but now regret, 
That I didn’t take your hand.
To spend around you so much time, 
And know that you’re not mine, 
It’s like the world is crushing me, 
And nothing can be fine.
I had so many chances, 
To tell you how I feel, 
But I was scared of what you’d say, 
Didn’t know if it’s real.
I miss you when you’re not around, 
Even just a day.
It breaks my heart to see you go, 
I really wish you’d stay.
But we both know that cannot be, 
We can’t be together, 
But even so, remember this, 
I’ll be with you forever.
I love you more that life itself, 
More than words can tell, 
I will love you no matter what, 
Without you my life is hell. 


Give me your hand, my brother, search my face; 
Look in these eyes lest I should think of shame; 
For we have made an end of all things base. 
We are returning by the road we came. 

Your lot is with the ghosts of soldiers dead, 
And I am in the field where men must fight. 
But in the gloom I see your laurell’d head 
And through your victory I shall win the light. 


Many the wonders I this day have seen:
The sun, when first he kissed away the tears
That filled the eyes of Morn;—the laurelled peers
Who from the feathery gold of evening lean;— 
The ocean with its vastness, its blue green,
Its ships, its rocks, its caves, its hopes, its fears,
Its voice mysterious, which whoso hears
Must think on what will be, and what has been.
E'en now, dear George, while this for you I write,
Cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping
So scantly, that it seems her bridal night,
And she her half-discovered revels keeping.
But what, without the social thought of thee,
Would be the wonders of the sky and sea

Brother, today I sit on the brick bench of the house,
where you make a bottomless emptiness.
I remember we used to play at this hour, and mama
caressed us: "But, sons..


Now I go hide
as before, from all evening
lectures, and I trust you not to give me away.
Through the parlor, the vestibule, the corridors.
Later, you hide, and I do not give you away.
I remember we made ourselves cry,
brother, from so much laughing.

Miguel, you went into hiding
one night in August, toward dawn,
but, instead of chuckling, you were sad.
And the twin heart of those dead evenings
grew annoyed at not finding you. And now
a shadow falls on my soul.


Listen, brother, don't be late
coming out. All right? Mama might worry. 


People wish to be settled. Only as long as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.
-- Thoreau


My life has been
the instrument
for a mouth
I have never seen,
breathing wind
which comes
from I know not
where,
arranging and changing
my moods,
so as to make
an opening
for his voice.

Or hers.
mother with invisible
milk,
androgynous god
in whose grip
I struggle,
turning this way and that,
believing that I chart
my life,
my loves,
when in fact
it is she, he,
who charts them--
all for the sake
of some
as yet unwritten poem.

Twisting in the wind,
twisting like a pirate
dangling in a cage
from a high seawall,
the wind whips
through my bones
making an instrument,
my back a xylophone,
my sex a triangle
chiming,
my lips stretched tight
as drumskins,

I no longer care
who is playing me,
but fear
makes the hairs
stand up
on the backs
of my hands
when I think
that she may stop.

And yet I long
for peace
as fervently as you do--
the sweet connubial bliss
that admits no
turbulence,
the settled life
that defeats poetry,
the hearth before which
children play--
not poets' children,
ragtag, neurotic, demon-ridden,
but the apple-cheeked children
of the bourgeoisie.

My daughter dreams
of peace
as I do:
marriage, proper house,
proper husband,
nourishing dreamless
sex,
love like a hot toddy,
or an apple pie.

But the muse
has other plans
for me
and you.

Puppet mistress,
dangling us
on this dark proscenium,
pulling our strings,
blowing us
toward Cornwall,
toward Venice, toward Delphi,
toward some lurching
counterpane,
a tent upheld
by one throbbing
blood-drenched pole--
her pen, her pencil,
the monolith
we worship,
underneath
the gleaming moon. 

The first time, we met; you treated me, 
Like a sibling, like a brother.
It was friendship; it was love at first sight; 
In a very short time, you became my faithful mentor, 
The good shepherd despite your prestigious might. 

You do not discriminate against anybody; 
You are the man that I yearn to emulate: 
The consummate professional, the prelate, 
Who fights the right battle, and who, eventually, 
Won justice for your sanity and for others.

When we worked together, you were not perfect, 
However, I could rely in you and trusted your ways; 
You had a way of dealing with the imperfect
World, you had a way to warn me of the dangers.

A man can love another man for his good character, 
For good morale, and unblemished behaviors.
Even now, you are still a brother, not an actor; 
You remain frank and truthful with me all the time.

My brother, you were the perfect employer, 
You stood by me in good time and in bad time.
When things got tough with the impostors, 
I stood by you, because I knew that you were innocent; 
Because I knew that you had strong work ethics
.
Family men like you and me, 
Quality men like you and me.
Even though that we look very different
From each other; 
You will forever
Remain my beloved brother.
I thank you for your understanding, 
You are my star; I thank you for everything.




Small, busy flames play through the fresh laid coals, 
And their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep 
Like whispers of the household gods that keep 
A gentle empire o'er fraternal souls. 
And while, for rhymes, I search around the poles, 
Your eyes are fix d, as in poetic sleep, 
Upon the lore so voluble and deep, 
That aye at fall of night our care condoles. 
This is your birth-day Tom, and I rejoice 
That thus it passes smoothly, quietly. 
Many such eves of gently whisp'ring noise 
May we together pass, and calmly try 
What are this world s true joys, ere the great voice, 
From its fair face, shall bid our spirits fly. 


If spicy-fringed pinks that blush and pale
 With passions of perfume, -- if violets blue
 That hint of heaven with odor more than hue, --
If perfect roses, each a holy Grail
Wherefrom the blood of beauty doth exhale
 Grave raptures round, -- if leaves of green as new
 As those fresh chaplets wove in dawn and dew
By Emily when down the Athenian vale
She paced, to do observance to the May,
 Nor dreamed of Arcite nor of Palamon, --
If fruits that riped in some more riotous play
 Of wind and beam that stirs our temperate sun, --
  If these the products be of love and pain,
  Oft may I suffer, and you love, again. 


You will smile all through your youthful life
Because I have chosen to make you happy
Do you have the charm and Charisma of a faithful wife? 
Please remain in the closet -that is where you belong

I will build you an empire to make you happy
For your happiness is drawn from worldly material
I will even buy you a grave- if you like
For I am here to make you happy
But please remain in the closet -that is where you belong

Your happiness is mine
For when you are happy; I am happy
I can extract the product of your happiness
As you extract my not dented wallet
But please remain in the closet -that is where you belong

I want to remind you that
My covenant with you
Shall last with you as long as I have my breathe
Do not claim inheritance when I am gone
For you belong to the closet

Do not claim paternity test when I am long gone
I want to be respected in death
I want my bones to rest traditionally in peace
For I have hidden you in a closet
Where only mistresses like you belong


Sweetheart the thought of you- never leaves me
Following me round every bend I turn
And though sometimes this world can be deceiving
You're my flame of truth that always burns 

Little Eagle so far up I can hardly see you
But there's a fire in your wings I can see
The laughter in your eyes always shines thru
And the love in your heart's like the sea. 

The blood in your veins, O it runs true
You're every dream I dreamed- silently.
Child of the wind and the wild blue-
Eagles were born to be free.

Little angel of mine- just a little crazy
Wild flower in the garden of time
My hair is graying, thoughts get hazy-
But I love you- daughter of mine. 

O little one, daughter, my dearest,
With your smiles and your beautiful curls,
And your laughter, the brightest and clearest,
O gravest and gayest of girls;

With your hands that are softer than roses,
And your lips that are lighter than flowers,
And that innocent brow that discloses
A wisdom more lovely than ours;

With your locks that encumber, or scatter
In a thousand mercurial gleams,
And those feet whose impetuous patter
I hear and remember in dreams;

With your manner of motherly duty,
When you play with your dolls and are wise;
With your wonders of speech, and the beauty
In your little imperious eyes;

When I hear you so silverly ringing
Your welcome from chamber or stair.
When you run to me, kissing and clinging,
So radiant, so rosily fair;

I bend like an ogre above you;
I bury my face in your curls;
I fold you, I clasp you, I love you.

If ever two were one, then surely we. 
     If ever man were lov'd by wife, then thee. 
     If ever wife was happy in a man, 
     Compare with me, ye women, if you can. 
     I prize thy love more than whole Mines of gold 
     Or all the riches that the East doth hold. 
     My love is such that Rivers cannot quench, 
     Nor ought but love from thee give recompetence. 
    Thy love is such I can no way repay.
   The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray. 
   Then while we live, in love let's so persever
   That when we live no more, we may live ever. 

This Book by Any yet vnread,
I leaue for yov when I am dead,
That, being gone, here yov may find
What was your liueing mother's mind.
Make vse of what I leaue in Loue

She. .., not my student.
But she's always submissive my words.
Whatever I force her, 
Ow! she could follow like a master.
I bet nothing can stop her glorious future.

She. .., not my teacher.
But I have to learn noble manners from her.
Whenever I glimpse her actions, 
Ow! they're full of precious lessons.
I bet no word is worth to mention.

She. .., not my girlfriend.
But her verses are straight to my heart.
Wherever I feel creations of her pen, 
Ow! thrill comes to me with rhythm.
I bet no beauty can compare her poems.

She. .., not my relative.
But we build up fantastic friendship.
Whoever asks me to stay away from her, 
Ow! why do I part my lovely pick-up sister? 
I bet our poetry will make us close forever. 

Oh slumber
You're a very interesting character.
You come when I'm in a rush
You leave when everything's in a hush.
In the night, 
You make me feel like I'm lying on tether
In daylight, 
My bed is softer than the turtle dove's feather.

Oh slumber
You're a very interesting character.
Do visit me, in the new year, 
Be sure to be here.
At the right time, please come.
Be my guest, you're always welcome. 

The spring dawned after the biting chill, 
Beams of sunlight filtered down, 
Flakes of snow melted away, 
 And the whole world bathed in brilliant glow.

He came, 
The dainty Darling of our dreams! 
With promises full and hopes in store, 
To fill the void, 
within our souls.
To burst the silence, 
with clatter of sounds.
To dispel the gloom, 
that hovered on.

High from Heaven, 
like a cherubim sent, 
with the glow of umpteen candles lit, 
He came, 
To gladden our doleful hearts, 
To deliver us of our blighted state.

He came, 
Like the first rain on parched ground, 
To drench the arid lands in splendid shower, 
To ease the prick of sweltering heat, 
And to put out the fire of growing drought.

Marvelling over the seizure of treasure, 
Long hidden within the crevices dark, 
We stood, so pleasantly taken aback, 
Over the gift, ere vouched, but long delayed.

Like an eagle in its aerial route, 
Flew my spirits in ecstatic rounds.
Like the Swallow, soaring high above, 
My fancy took wings and set to fly.

He lay close to me, the bundle of joy! 
His dark little eyes poised on my face, 
Full with words on silent lips, 
And wonder glistening his naive visage.

I peered into that cute little face, 
The face I had long fondled in my dreams, 
I whirled in the feel of prime feed, 
And swam in the glory of maternal bliss

Lets go outside, love is in the air
Don't be idle today sitting in the chair.
let's roam today with open heart.
Let's fly  far and far like a bird.
Be my close, look at my eyes.
Talk to me, never tell lies.
Let me hold you, don't be shy
Make me warm, don't say bye.
Lean on my breasts, listen to heart.
Really I love you, it's not flirt.
Believe me fair lady, o listen! 
Be seated a while and go then. 

Lets go outside, love is in the air
Don't be idle today sitting in the chair.
let's roam today with open heart.
Let's fly  far and far like a bird.
Be my close, look at my eyes.
Talk to me, never tell lies.
Let me hold you, don't be shy
Make me warm, don't say bye.
Lean on my breasts, listen to heart.
Really I love you, it's not flirt.
Believe me fair lady, o listen! 
Be seated a while and go then. 

This poem I devote to my student I dote, 
To my beautiful Sonya.
May be she’ll be a lawyer
As she hates deceivers
And think how to overcome rough rivers.
May be she’ll be an actress
As she can imitate anyone perfectly well
And her voice sounds like a bell.
So, may be she’ll be a famous singer
Or a well-known writer
As her imagination is great.
She would like to meet with the aliens
And get a residence on another planet.
I think if she now plans it
Without any debate
She’ll always be on a high rate
With a happy fate.
She could be a well-known designer
As her drawings are beautiful
With a lot of fantasy and still dutiful.
Life will show her which road to chose, 
But I am sure she will never lose.
She will use all her talents
Not for her parents
But for herself
Understanding and value
The beauty of life itself, 
Knowing that happiness is not in money
But in the days that are sunny, 
In that one who is a crony
With a stony and noble action, 
With the human attraction.
And here is, my dearest friend, 
Something I would like to portend: 
Your life road won’t be always easy, 
Some days can be stormy or breezy, 
But you must walk it with patience and valiance, 
Hating any violence
And if fighting then only for peace and love.
For a king calling you: You are my dove.

Is still your heritage from Deity,
And, still, the languid maidens’ eyes
Are turned to you as well intently.
So, play and sing, friends of my years!
Lose very quickly passing evening,
And, at your heedless joy and singing,
I will be smiling through my tears. 

Dear friends, and here I say friends
the broad sense of the word:
Wife, sister, associates, relatives,
Schoolmates of both sexes,
People seen only once
Or frequented all my life;
Provided that between us, for at least a moment,
A line has been stretched,
A well-defined bond.
I speak for you, companions of a crowded
Road, not without its difficulties,
And for you too, who have lost
Soul, courage, the desire to live;
Or no one, or someone, or perhaps only one person, or you
Who are reading me: remember the time
Before the wax hardened,
When everyone was like a seal.
Each of us bears the imprint
Of a friend met along the way;
In each the trace of each.
For good or evil
In wisdom or in folly
Everyone stamped by everyone.
Now that the time crowds in
And the undertakings are finished,
To all of you the humble wish
That autumn will be long and mild. 

In the night I climbed up the hill.
The rocky way was not hard
while I think of you always.

My heart will not come to peace

This  holy morning I reached the top
and call  you looking up to the heavens
I raise up my  hands to you.

Come and show me your face
Oh the faceless and bodyless one.



I leave for thee, beloved one, 
The home and friends of youth, 
Trusting my hopes, my happiness, 
Unto thy love and truth; 
I leave for thee my girlhood's joys, 
Its sunny, careless mirth, 
To bear henceforth my share amid 
The many cares of earth. 

And yet, no wild regret I give 
To all that now I leave, 
The golden dreams, the flow'ry wreaths 
That I no more may weave; 
The future that before me lies 
A dark and unknown sea -- 
Whate'er may be its storms or shoals, 
I brave them all with thee! 

I will not tell thee now of love 
Whose life, ere this, thou'st guessed, 
And which, like sacred secret, long 
Was treasured in my breast; 
Enough that if thy lot be calm, 
Or storms should o'er it sweep, 
Thou'lt learn that it is woman's love, 
Unchanging, pure and deep. 

If this life's sunshine gild thy lot, 
Bestowing wealth and pride, 
Its light enjoying, I shall stand, 
Rejoicing, at thy side; 
But, oh! if thou should'st prove the griefs 
That blight thy fellow-men, 
'Twill be my highest, dearest right, 
To be, love, with thee then. 

And thou, wilt thou not promise me 
Thy heart will never change, 
That tones and looks, so loving now, 
Will ne'er grow stern and strange? 
That thou'lt be kind, whatever faults 
Or failings may be mine, 
And bear with them in patient love, 
As I will bear with thine

We share secrets, we laugh and even cry, 
We have so much in common, 
Concerns, likes and dislikes.
Ours is a relationship joined by
Tender velvet chains that link our
Similar dreams of life and love.
A gentle intuition guides us in our
Individual struggles to succeed, 
To stand out from the crowd.
In you I have found so much of myself, 
Including many of the same
Insecurities and philosophies.
Complete inner-peace and happiness, 
These are the things I wish for you, 
In the present and in the future
Because you are my kindred spirit.

The amorous youth, whose tender breast
Was by his darling Cat possest,
Obtain'd of Venus his desire,
Howe'er irregular his fire:
Nature the power of love obey'd,
The Cat became a blushing maid,
And on the happy change the boy
Employ'd his wonder and his joy. 
Take care, O beauteous child, take care,
Lest thou prefer so rash a prayer,
Will e'er thy favourite's charms improve.
O quickly from her shrine retreat,
Or tremble for thy darling's fate.
Her own Adonis live in thee,
Will lightly her first loss deplore,
Will easily forgive the boar:
Her eyes with tears no more will flow,
With jealous rage her breast will glow, 
And on her tabby rival's face
She deep will mark a new disgrace. 




No  ‘dog’  were you for me; you were my family member; 
My darling dove you were, whom lifelong I’ll remember.
I know you loved me truly and understood me too; 
On getting the merest clue you knew well what to do! 

Whenever I wrapped your ears in readiness for your bath, 
Straight towards your bathroom you’d always lead my path! 
Fidgeting not, you’d freely let me shampoo you, 
As and when required turning around too! 

The bottle of your eardrops whene’er you saw me hold, 
You’d dropp down on your flank - without being told -
To receive the drops into your ear more easily; 
And then change flanks, your other ear to offer me! 

Should someone tease you, snatching away your favourite snacks, 
Rushing you’d come to me  - each moment looking back, -
Then ‘nose’ my knees and gurgle / grunt, with a paw pointing
Towards the ‘offender’ by way of complaining! 

When I myself to someone’s pranks, at times, was victim
Wouldn’t you howl and howl your head off at her or him? 
Your  ‘guardian’  was I but, as my  ‘guard’  - night and day -
You kept vigil, keeping harm out of my way! 

But now no more you are, my most faithful friend! 
Our happy times together have reached the rudest end.
No more for me the several signals of your love, 
Since still on earth I am and you’re in Heaven above! 

From outdoors when I return, you’ll receive me no more
With your typical ‘welcome whoops’ at the master door; 
Barring my way in, no more will you stand
And raise your right foreleg, offering a ‘shake-hand’! 

Your love knew no limits; you shared it with felines
As much as with humans and your brethren canines.
Numerous kittens hadn’t you suckled soulfully
And frisked about with many a cat mirthfully? 

Apart from me and other inmates of our house, 
You let our guests too - sans snarls or ‘whow-whows’ -
 Hold and pet your pups as soon as they were born! 
 Your faith in all was such, of mistrust wholly shorn.

Along with your puppies you suckled kittens too, 
And allowed cats to play with them! You well knew
No harm to them will even our feline fam’ly cause -
By keeping carefully in control their sharp claws.

But now when our kittens by street dogs are chased, 
You’ll spurt no more your ‘siren screams’ like one crazed! 
When Jimmy takes to tantrums, you’ll calm him down no more
By fondling his forehead with your soft and soothing paw! 

Your last four months, able not to eat on your own, 
- Your bloated belly having become as hard as stone -
Umpteen times, each hour, you’d ope’ your mouth for me
To spoon-feed you with liquids, despite your difficulty.

Cancer creates excruciating pain, I’m told; 
But not a single moan you uttered till you were cold! 
You hid from me your suff’ring lest I weep for you: 
At your selfless sufferance amazed were doctors too! 

Though day by day reduced you were to skin and bone, 
Hearing not from you, at any time, a groan
To indicate your subjection to intensive pain, 
Hardly could I believe that by Cancer you were slain! 

Six days before your death, didn’t you wag your tail
When a visitor greeted you, pretending you were hale? 
 Others in your plight would have whined and wailed.
Your courage and composure unknown heights had scaled! 

Although a ‘country’ dog not claiming any ‘breed’, 
In temper’ment and talents you matchless were indeed! 
Your lovely life’s story will soon become folklore.

With all our guests and visitors you were always friendly; 
All our cats and kittens you always treated kindly.
A dog so good and gracious, so loving and lovable, 
More than ‘one in a crore’ can be - is it believable? 

For over eleven years were you my prized possession.
Of letting us be together for at least a few years more.
But this was not to be; no points my prayers could score.

Miserable though I feel, at times I’m glad - realising
That rid you are for ever of severest suffering.
With liver, spleen and ut’rus all damaged beyond measure, 
Would hanging on to life have given you any pleasure? 

In your final moments, when people pulled me back, 
Preventing distraught me from clasping you - alack! -, 
What supernal source lent you sudden energy
To half lift yourself and crawl up towards me? 

Your laying your head upon my feet your last breath
To leave - I’ll forget not until my own death.
What surer proof of gratitude and loyal love
Than this star salute of yours, O Julie, my dove? 

In my heart you’ll live though bodily you’re no more; 
Of your many mem’ries my mind maintains a store.
My dreams revolve around you many a blessed night
When, of your living image I’m able to catch sight.

I often used to worry what will become of you
 Should I leave this world ere you could so do.
This perplexing problem thus to solve HE chose: -
Electing to grant you, first, everlasting repose.

Cruel though to me, to you kind HE was; 
 Each clause of HIS laws, is surely free of flaws? 
 In my care, Julie dear, though you were happy; 
In HIS eternal care, blissfu





I’m sorry you don’t love me, 
I’m sorry you don’t care.
I tried so hard to please you, 
But you were never there.
All I did, I did for you, 
I tried to make you proud.
But now, I feel I’d be better off, 
Covered in a shroud.
If I cried, you didn’t care, 
When I bled, you jeered.
I can find no help from you, 
It’s as I always feared.
So lead on your precious lives, 
Enjoy your disappointment.
I’ll survive without you somehow, 
I’m sorry I’m not heaven sent. 


Growing out from childish pranks, 
With the storm and stress of turbulent teens, 
I locked within my mind’s cupboard, 
A portrait vaguely sketched, but never finished.

Rough it was, though fancifully done, 
The silhouette of a masculine figure, 
The Gallant who would reach one day, 
To hold my hand and own me his.

I had no inkling who he would, 
He had dazzling eyes and sturdy limbs, 
With striking features, ravishing to view, 

Elusive ever to sight and touch, 
He remained an enigma, abstract to grasp.
At times his contours grew distinct, 
But soon blanched out into hazy lines, 

When a covert devouring look, 
Or a pair of intent adoring eyes, 
Sent a thrill down my fickle heart, 
I forced open my chest nut draw, 

And took out stealthily that half done sketch, 
Hidden out from world’s staring glance, 
To alter the features one by one, 
And make it resemble the man I met, 

Either within a moving train, 
Or sometimes in an elite gang, 
Who derailed my thoughts in pensive mood, 
And tickled my fancy to heave and sigh.

He made me turn and toss in bed, 
And left me, many a sleepless night, 
He stroked my heart with gladdening ache, 
And made me lose in sweet reverie.

In the nick of time, he solemnly came, 
To hold my hand and tie the knot, 
With pounding heart and quivering breath, 
I found him differ from the man I dreamt.

The fabulous fabric in my loom, 
Looked at variance from the one unfurled, 
Transfixed between fact and fallacy, 
I struggled to hide a falling tear.

Time marched on in silent haste, 
And I learnt to outgrow my childish whims, 
Sagacity dawned with passing age, 
Making me discern the real from the sham.

It made me admire his sanguine self.
On fathomed deep beyond external mien, 
I saw him unveiled in taint less worth, 
That made my heart pine in love.

Piecing together our halved selves, 
With the glue of love, our identities merged, 
Now he is with me in my blues, 
Consoling me with his balmy touch, 

He is with me in my joy, 
Making it resonant with a hearty laugh, 
He is there when storms rage, 
Whispering in my ear, not to fear, 

He taught me how to savour life, 
To meet the slings with radiant cheer, 
Now the image is etched deep, 
Never to erase, nor to revise! 

And the old portrait locked within, 
Grew so musty, bereft of use, 
In its place, I keep within, 
His solid figure in indelible print. 


Sometimes I know the words to say, 
To give thanks for all you’ve done, 
But they fly up and away, 
As quickly as they come. 

How could I thank you enough, 
The one who makes me whole, 
The one to whom I owe my life, 
And the forming of my soul. 

The one who tucked me in at night, 
The one who stopped me from crying, 
The one who was the expert
At picking up when I was lying. 

The one who drops me off at school, 
And spends every day at work, 
Yet magically can produce a smile, 
Even when I act like a jerk. 

The one who makes many sacrifices, 
To always put me first, 
Who lets me test my broken hearts, 
In spite of how much it hurts. 

Who paints my worlds with a rainbow, 
When its filled with broken dreams, 
Who explains it all so clearly, 
Even when everything is not what it seems. 

Are there really any words for this, 
I find this question though, 
Anything I want to say, 
Just doesn’t seem to be enough. 

How can I thank you, 
For your sweat, your heart and your tears, 
For the million things you’ve done for me, 
After all these amazing years. 

For changing with me when I changed, 
Accepting all my flaws, 
Not loving me ‘cause you had to, 
But loving just because. 

For never giving up on me, 
When your wits had reached their end, 
For always being proud of me
For being my best friend.

And so I have come to realize, 
The only way to say. 
It’s the only way to thank you
It's clear in one way. 

Look at me stand here before you, 
To see the person that I have become, 
Do you see yourself in me? 
The job that you have done


Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
      The angels, whispering to one another,
    Can find, among their burning terms of love,
      None so devotional as that of "Mother,"
    Therefore by that dear name I long have called you-
      You who are more than mother unto me,
    And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you
      In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
    My mother- my own mother, who died early,
      Was but the mother of myself; but you
    Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
      And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
    By that infinity with which my wife
      Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life. 


Most near, most dear, most loved and most far,
Under the window where I often found her
Sitting as huge as Asia, seismic with laughter,
Gin and chicken helpless in her Irish hand,
Irresistible as Rabelais, but most tender for
The lame dogs and hurt birds that surround her -
She is a procession no one can follow after
But be like a little dog following a brass band.

She will not glance up at the bomber, or condescend
To drop her gin and scuttle to a cellar,
But lean on the mahogany table like a mountain
Whom only faith can move, and so I send
O all my faith, and all my love to tell her
That she will move from mourning into morning. 

And I, for whom each day repeats all days
Continuously in ecstasy of praise,
Love's birthday lasting through the unending year,
Am dreaming how the spirit draws me sheer
From farthest wandering in the illusive maze
To that white centre whose creative blaze
Spun me aloft and sets me tremulous here.
And since all heaven is figured in my heart,
As in a dewdrop ere it change and live
There shines the glory of the eternal dome,
Mother, to you the showering meteors dart
Of free affection, fancies fugitive,
And flare, with increasing heat and splendour, home. 


I chose you.
I am my mother's baby, 
And you gladly raised me.

I am your daughter, 
Proud to call you my mother.

At times we don't see eye to eye, 
I know you will always remain in my life.
With you by my side, 
I'm always going to make you smile.

Always there giving great advice, 
You now can walk the streets with your head up high full of pride.

Because we both know you made an amazing child.



Wrapped around in my swaddling clothes, 
I saw her bright beaming face.
Lying helpless, still in a trance, 
I sensed her soft soothing touch.

Warm it was when huddled tight, 
Glad it was to be held close, 
Pleasure it was to be lifted up, 
And Heaven it was to be in her lap.

She took me in her gentle hands, 
She fed me with her nourishing milk, 
She made me sleep with lullabies sweet, 
And kept alert on day and night.

As time slowly glided past, 
I grew myself into a tiny tot.
I crawled around in sweeping haste, 
Reaching out to all I could touch.

It left my mother so hardly pressed.
She never had any time to sit, 
Cut down she, her afternoon nap, 
Cast aside she her rest and respite.

My teething time - a real hard time! 
For reasons none, I grew so irritable.
Itchy - fidgety, I cried on end, 
Futile went all her tricks to tame.

This made my mother grow jittery.
Consulted she every quack and doc, 
Administered she every harmless dope, 
And interceded to all divine help. 

It was only a passing phase, 
With consistent care, I grew to a buxom babe.
My childish pranks delighted all.
Too glad my mother grew to see me fare.

Soon I learnt to steady myself up, 
The Toddler placed the first faltering step.
It was always with abated breath, 
My mother watched my growing up.

She ever remained a pillar of strength, 
In whom I saw, a never failing friend.
She led me through the devious turns of life, 
Always there to lend her helping hand.

Wise it was to seek her counsel - 
In complex issues too hard to solve, 
Sane and sound, she ever remained.
To trials of life, she never surrendered.

She taught me the quintessence of life, 
She showed me the route to tread, 
Her zest for life, never once cease, 

Now my mother ceases to exist, 
But sure she will continue to live, 
In my hearts domain, she reigns supreme.
No force on Earth can cast her out.

As I look back to days of yore, 
All I wish is to conjure up the past, 
To be reborn a second time, 
To be my mother's darling child


The dawn broke, tearing the dark shroud of gloom, 
And lights turned on to greet another day, 
Life taking its new course all around, 
but in this room, life coming to an end! 
No stir except the sound of faint breathing, 
strangled hoarse within her feeble throat.
Walking over to the bed, I took her fragile hand, 
and stroked it mildly in slow rhythm, 
Smoothed the soft fleecy hair, lying dishevelled 
that remained once so neatly combed.


I watched life gently slipping away, 
The inevitable end to an eventful play! 
Breaking all bounds, memories cascaded out, 
and the mind changed into a river in spate, 
Fondly surveyed her features and the face, 
with a foreboding of never getting another chance.
Looked into the heart that held within, 
an ocean of love that ebbed and swelled.
Words struggled to fly out from my lips, 
Words never, ever said, 
but took for granted that she knew.
I sensed the dampness on my cheeks, 
and a lump forming within my throat.

This woman taught me once for all, 
I could do what ever I set my mind to, 
Who with wings out spread stood hovering, 
Over her chicks when eagles swooped down.
Exhorted to brave daringly ahead, 
through the dank and dark corridors of life
chasing the glimmer of light, 
at the threshold of a brighter world.
Insisted on not to beguile the just, 
But hold on to truth always.

 
I stood silent, my gaze fixed on the limp figure, 
Now resting calmly on a propped up bed, 
Her dried up bosom heaving high and low, 
I knew her breath slowly dying down.
With a strained belch, she turned her head sideways, 
With a sudden flutter, her sealed eyes were opened ajar.

Her benevolent eyes fixed on my face for once, 
Did a smile fleet across that pallid face? 
Oh! The eyeballs suddenly turned upwards, 
And her mouth, slightly opened to let out the breath

She went noiselessly with so much ease, 
like a feather, falling gently on the ground.

Vacantly I watched a solitary loon flying west ward, 
and beyond the horizon it disappeared like a mote


My sister writes her poems
	of the life that she is livin'
	She writes of people, places, things, 
	of memories once given.
	Her poems capture feelings, 
	Her poems capture life, 
	but never tell of anger, 
	and never talk of strife.

	She loves all things in nature, 
	soaring eagle, hooting owl.
	She pinned me to the bed
	when my tongue was mean and foul.
	She taught me to be good and kind, 
	and drink the bitter cup.
	She made me promise that I would
	before she let me up.

	She has touched the misty moonlight
	and the shady mountain glen, 
	and caressed the golden meadow
	with her ever-flowing pen.
	She has talked of things that have gone by, 
	of home-made fudge and 


	She has told us of our loved ones, 
	and set our hearts aglow.

	She writes of babies, fathers, mothers, 
	sunsets swirling pink.
	She captures precious moments, 
	and saves them in her ink.
	She writes of blossoms budding out, 
	of flowers on the hill.
	She tells of fishes in the pond, 
	and the vacant Glenwood mill.

	Her poetry is wonderful, 
	her poems are so fine.
	She writes of Rewards Royal, 
	and Dividends Divine.
	She writes of pretty flowers, 
	Marigold and Daffodil, 
	and captures all the freshness
	in the liquid of her quill.
 
	How I wish that I could emulate
	her wisdom and her grace, 
	and follow her to Heaven, 
	and again behold His face! 
	How I wish that I could capture
	but a portion of her skill, 
	and write of people, places, things, 
	and always do His will.

	Did she forgive me for the evil
	and the meanness of my ways? 
	Will she forever pay me tribute, 
	and always give me praise? 
	Will she continue to remember
	only happy things, not hate? 
	Will she continue now to guide me
	up and through the pearly gate? 

	She has raised her seven daughters, 
	nearly perfect, every one, 
	slow to anger, slow to marry, 
	but they'll all get the job done.
	When mother went to Heaven
	she was there to clean and cook.
	She writes of Robins in the tree, 
	and of the babbling brook.

	Will she write of things that are to come, 
	of peasants, kings, and crowds? 
	and descending from the clouds? 
	Will she write about the evil
	and destruction that's no fun, 
	or only of the greater love
	and kindness of the Son? 

	She has been a good example
	and a model for our lives.
	She has been a sister, mother, friend, 
	and reached out to our wives.
	She has taught us some great lessons, 
	and here I illustrate one: 
	Poems
	don't always
	need to rhyme! 
	I love you my sister.

To my mother
I can’t find the words that deserve to describe my feelings for you
You are greater than any description
Now I am a mother and I hardly understand how you wre so happy with us
Whatever we said, whatever we did..
You were and you are always the most patient and most wonderful mother.
You were our shelter in our hard times
You are still the great mother I have known
But, we have been so ungrateful
I know, you feel so lonely and helpless
So close so far from us
How I feel sorry about you
And can’t do much for you
Though you need us all
No one cares at all
Sorry mum
Whatever I do I’ll never do enough
To thank you for all the good things
You deprived yourself to give us
You were our heat in the freezing nights
You were our shadow in the hot days
I know, how you feel so lonely
So tired by the long nights of winter
And long days of the summer
I beg your pardon 
I am a mother now, and will be a grandmother soon
I know the feeling of love you had for us
The joy that filled your heart whenever we did something good



More than a catbird hates a cat,
Or a criminal hates a clue,
Or the Axis hates the United States,
That's how much I love you.

I love you more than a duck can swim,
And more than a grapefruit squirts,
I love you more than a gin rummy is a bore,
And more than a toothache hurts.

As a shipwrecked sailor hates the sea,
Or a juggler hates a shove,
As a hostess detests unexpected guests,
That's how much you I love.

I love you more than a wasp can sting,
And more than the subway jerks,
I love you as much as a beggar needs a crutch,
And more than a hangnail irks.

I swear to you by the stars above,
And below, if such there be,
As the High Court loathes perjurious oathes,
That's how you're loved by me. 

Twenty years of married life have rolled off fast! 
Our woes and trials are things of the past; 
Our earthly problems, strife cannot long last; 
The world of joys in store for us is vast! 


The love you gave to me was memorable; 
The care you gave us all was adorable; 
The timely words you spoke were admirable; 
The toil you gave for family – incomparable! 

We’ve learnt to live in piety, accord; 
Let’s call to Him aloud when in distress.

Let love be bond between the spouses two; 
Let fortitude be guide in things we do; 
Let heaven be our goal and dream always.

Let’s work unceasingly and without fear; 
Let peace prevail when end of life gets near; 

 The massive message of Beethoven tell
With thy ten fingers to the people's heart
 As if ten tongues told news of heaven and hell, --
Gazing on thee, I mark that not alone,
 Ah, not alone, thou sittest:  there, by thee,
Beethoven's self, dear living lord of tone,
 Doth stand and smile upon thy mastery.
Full fain and fatherly his great eyes glow:
 He says, "From Heaven, my child, I heard thee call
(For, where an artist plays, the sky is low):
 Yea, since my lonesome life did lack love's all,




"Each one is my dear valentine; 
Each unforgettable; 
Like sun and moon, you ever shine, 
You are admirable! 

Just share your love with all brethren; 
Your patients need much care; 
By sharing love, earth turns heaven; 
Then sufferings are rare! 

You nightingales can sing good songs, 
And make all dance to tune; 
Nevertheless, avoid all wrongs; 
To vice, become immune! 

Give love to unwanted babies; 
Comfort the dying ones; 
Give ailing people, mental peace; 
Let sweet words spill in tons! 

Spread happiness in every way, 
Be kind to all around; 
Love cures more illnesses each day, 
Like rain upon parched ground.

Dean has a place within his heart
For everyone of you; 
In earthly life, just do your part; 
Then success smiles on you.




Thou hast clomb aloft, and gazed
From the watch-towers of Helvellyn;
Awed, delighted, and amazed!

Potent was the spell that bound thee
Not unwilling to obey;
For blue Ether's arms, flung round thee,
Stilled the pantings of dismay.

Lo! the dwindled woods and meadows;
What a vast abyss is there! 
Lo! the clouds, the solemn shadows,
And the glistenings--heavenly fair!

And a record of commotion
Which a thousand ridges yield;
Ridge, and gulf, and distant ocean
Gleaming like a silver shield!

Maiden! now take flight;--inherit
Alps or Andes--they are thine!
With the morning's roseate Spirit,
Sweep their length of snowy line; 

Or survey their bright dominions
In the gorgeous colours drest
Flung from off the purple pinions,
Evening spreads throughout the west!

Thine are all the coral fountains
Warbling in each sparry vault
Of the untrodden lunar mountains;
Listen to their songs!--or halt,

To Niphates' top invited,
Whither spiteful Satan steered; 
Or descend where the ark alighted,
When the green earth re-appeared;

For the power of hills is on thee,
As was witnessed through thine eye
Then, when old Helvellyn won thee
To confess their majesty


Seraph! thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted far-off isle
In some tumultuous sea -
Some ocean vexed as it may be
With storms; but where, meanwhile,
Serenest skies continually
Just o'er that one bright island smile. 
For 'mid the earnest cares and woes
That crowd around my earthly path,
(Sad path, alas, where grows
Not even one lonely rose!)
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee; and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose. 


Thou wast all that to me, love,
         For which my soul did pine-
       A green isle in the sea, love,
         A fountain and a shrine,
       All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
         And all the flowers were mine.

       Ah, dream too bright to last!
         Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
       But to be overcast!
         A voice from out the Future cries,
       'On! on!'- but o'er the Past
         (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
       Mute, motionless, aghast!

       For, alas! alas! me
         For me the light of Life is over!
         'No more- no more- no more-'
       (Such language holds the solemn sea
         To the sands upon the shore)
       Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree
         Or the stricken eagle soar!

       And all my days are trances,
         And all my nightly dreams
       Are where thy grey eye glances,
         And where thy footstep gleams-
       In what ethereal dances,
         By what eternal streams. 

To one who has been long in city pent, 
         'Tis very sweet to look into the fair
         And open face of heaven,--to breathe a prayer
     Full in the smile of the blue firmament.
     Who is more happy, when, with heart's content,
         Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
         Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair
     And gentle tale of love and languishment?
     Returning home at evening, with an ear
         Catching the notes of Philomel,--an eye
     Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,
         He mourns that day so soon has glided by:
     E'en like the passage of an angel's tear
         That falls through the clear ether silently. 


I.
One word is too often profaned
For me to profane it,
One feeling too falsely disdained
For thee to disdain it;
One hope is too like despair
For prudence to smother,
And pity from thee more dear
Than that from another.

II.
I can give not what men call love,
But wilt thou accept not 
The worship the heart lifts above
And the Heavens reject not,--
The desire of the moth for the star,
Of the night for the morrow,
The devotion to something afar 
From the sphere of our sorrow



Friend by enemy I call you out.
You with a bad coin in your socket,
You my friend there with a winning air
Who palmed the lie on me when you looked
Brassily at my shyest secret,
Enticed with twinkling bits of the eye
Till the sweet tooth of my love bit dry,
Rasped at last, and I stumbled and sucked,
Whom now I conjure to stand as thief
In the memory worked by mirrors,
With unforgettably smiling act,
Quickness of hand in the velvet glove
And my whole heart under your hammer,
Were once such a creature, so gay and frank
A desireless familiar
I never thought to utter or think
While you displaced a truth in the air,


That though I loved them for their faults
As much as for their good,
My friends were enemies on stilts
With their heads in a cunning cloud. 

I snapped a twig beneath my shoe, 
and a startled bird flew o’er my head.
Crisp leaves were sprinkled on their tops with dew, 
coloured, each one, in an autumnal hue, 
and thickly spread.

Across the park, beneath the trees, 
helped by the breeze, they’d descended down.
Carpeting the ground with a cushioned layer.
A splendid scene of such impressive flair, 
in shades of brown.

A squirrel always so alert, 
stood, rigid, inert and listened hard.
Then with an impish look made fast retreat, 
by scuttling off, his tasty nuts to eat, 
but still on guard.

Silence fell, no sound pierced the ear, 
nothing to hear, quiet peace serene.
Then rutting stags called out to their new mates, 
each bellow from a powerful throat vibrates, 
their passions keen.

Strange that a twig beneath my toes, 
can scatter the sparrows into instant flight.
In a fragile locale these creatures dwell, 
to them it’s home and therefore they excel, 
To our delight. 



Again & again
I have read your books
without ever wishing to know you.

    I suck the alphabet of blood.
    I chew the iron filings of your words.
    I kiss your images like moist mouths
    while the black seeds of your syllables
    fly, fly, fly
    into my lungs.

Untranslated, untranslatable,
you are rooted inside me-
not you-but the you
of your poems:

    the man of his word,
    the lover who digs into the alien soil
    of one North American woman
    & plants a baby-
    love-child of Whitman
    crossed with the Spanish language,
    embryo, sapling, half-breed
    of my tongue.

I saw you once-
your flesh-
at Columbia.
My alma mater
& you the visiting soul.

    Buddha-like
    you sat before a Buddha;
    & the audience
    craned its neck
    to take you in.

Freak show-
visiting poet.
You sat clothed
in your thick
imperious flesh.

    I wanted to comfort you
    & not to stare.
    Our words knew each other.
    That was enough.

Now you are dead
of fascism & cancer-
your books scattered,
the oil cruet on the floor.

    The sea surges through your house
    at Isla Negra,
    & the jackboots
    walk on water.

Poet of cats & grapefruits,
of elephant saints;
poet of broken dishes
& Machu Picchu;
poet of panthers
& pantheresses;
poet of lemons,
poet of lemony light.

    The flies swarm
    thicker than print on a page,
    & poetry blackens
    like overripe bananas.
    The fascists you hated,
    the communists you loved,
    obscure the light, the lemons
    with their buzzing.

We were together
on the side of light.
We walked together
though we never met.

    The eyes are not political,
    nor the tastebuds,
    & the flesh tastes salty always
    like the sea;
    & the sea
    turns back the flies. 



O Peace! For ages haven't we invoked
Your grace by chanting your name ceaselessly? 
We're sorely tired; our voices are choked: 
Must you still evade us mercilessly? 

What will you accept as our libation? 
In vain we've offered you, at various stages, 
Of Faith and Hope a sweet distillation.
'Labour' too failed to win you as 'wages'.

Ah! You're too precious to be won cheaply! 
For you costlier things we need to barter.
We must place, one by one, successively, 
The rarest things at your holy alter-
   These being Love, Sacrifice, Selflessness, 
   Compassion, Contentment and Generousness. 



I have been travelling these
Untrodden paths
All alone
I never acknowledged; you were there
Always heard you as a common name
Echoing in my little-lateral brain
Endorsed by my Psychiatrist that it is fake
Proving it to be a first-rank symptom
Just to establish a working diagnosis
And wrote ample pills to quench my throat
Only to validate a new hypothesis
Is my life a hypothetical situation too? 
If it is
Then how come
That echoing green
Has come to life once again
It is little late though
But
Never too late
Today
I can proudly decree
I have not lived in vain
You have not lived in vain
We have not lived in vain



A fountain remains
the only durable object from those
two years of night-shifts, drunk nights, 
nightmares in single rooms. Two years, 
a continuous descent
to a source of myself that I couldn't
define. Almost everything was closed-off.
And I really thought it was all leading
to a source like that of the waves
where the quick water feeds
from the pollen
of melted snow.
I would come and sit in the garden
below tall flames of the unfallen maple
and watch the leaves blurred with dusk
in the shallow fountain shell.
And the night-shifts, the drunk nights, 
nightmares in single rooms, the sirens, 
the renewed leaves that depressed me― 
everything― dissolved in that water.
I passed those years like some unborn
cicada, ripening underground. I passed
those years wrapped in a thick larval blanket.
And the cicada that sometimes does not emerge
before seventeen years, the cicada rises
to play a tune on its drum
which is a marriage song to its mate. 
Through the years, the false ripenings
and the real ones, the jobs, and the endless travels, 
I have risen like that toward one woman, 
she is my pollen of melted snow, 
my tall unfallen flame. 
But from the other time― a fountain remains
the only durable thing, the only thing
that had no desire
to exceed or decrease
the small music that it made, 
the only thing connected
to its source


A smile or a wave
As I catch your eye
Just makes my day
As I pass by

Your smile in my dreams
Has the starring part
It sticks in my head
And touches my heart

Love? I don't know you
But I love what I see
I'd love to know more
And for you to know me

Please try not to worry
To be admired's just fine
I want to make your day
Like you maketh mine

To praise your beauty
I cannot tell lies.
As I become dumb
When I look at your eyes.


So here are few words
That I guessed once
When we were at river-bank
To have some romance.


Eyes are fine but
I cannot compare them.
For you will laugh at 
And  there's no fame.


I wonder every time
When you smile
And watch more
There's no guile.


I cannot call you
A fine fresh lily
It would be fine
But idea is silly.


You are more lovely
Than the morning rose.
With few dew drops
As the winter goes.


A cuckoo even listens
When you  sweetly talk.
Mild breeze starts
As you gently walk.


I cannot call you Mermaid
Your hairs are dry.
As clean as the white clouds
At evening summer sky.


I hear a sweet music
When you laugh.
These are the words
For you my love. 


The fine delight that fathers thought; the strong 
Spur, live and lancing like the blowpipe flame, 
Breathes once and, quenched faster than it came, 
Leaves yet the mind a mother of immortal song. 
Nine months she then, nay years, nine years she long
Within her wears, bears, cares and moulds the same: 
The widow of an insight lost she lives, with aim 
Now known and hand at work now never wrong. 
Sweet fire the sire of muse, my soul needs this; 
I want the one rapture of an inspiration.
O then if in my lagging lines you miss 
The roll, the rise, the carol, the creation, 
My winter world, that scarcely breathes that bliss 
Now, yields you, with some sighs, our explanation. 


You are young, and I am older;
You are hopeful, I am not -
Enjoy life, ere it grow colder -
Pluck the roses ere they rot.

Teach your beau to heed the lay -
That sunshine soon is lost in shade -
That now's as good as any day -
To take thee, Rosa, ere she fade. 


I would like to sing someone to sleep,
have someone to sit by and be with.
I would like to cradle you and softly sing,
be your companion while you sleep or wake.
I would like to be the only person
in the house who knew: the night outside was cold.
And would like to listen to you
and outside to the world and to the woods.

The clocks are striking, calling to each other,
and one can see right to the edge of time.
Outside the house a strange man is afoot
and a strange dog barks, wakened from his sleep.
Beyond that there is silence.

My eyes rest upon your face wide-open;
and they hold you gently, letting you go
when something in the dark begins to move. 

Never, never again?
Not on nights filled with quivering stars,
or during dawn's maiden brightness
or afternoons of sacrifice?

Or at the edge of a pale path
that encircles the farmlands,
or upon the rim of a trembling fountain,
whitened by a shimmering moon?

Or beneath the forest's
luxuriant, raveled tresses
where, calling his name,
I was overtaken by the night?
Not in the grotto that returns
the echo of my cry?

Oh no. To see him again --
it would not matter where --
in heaven's deadwater
or inside the boiling vortex,
under serene moons or in bloodless fright!

To be with him. 
every springtime and winter,
united in one anguished knot
around his bloody neck

To seem the stranger lies my lot, my life
Among strangers. Father and mother dear,
And he my peace my parting, sword and strife.
  England, whose honour O all my heart woos, wife
To my creating thought, would neither hear
Me, were I pleading, plead nor do I: I wear-
y of idle a being but by where wars are rife. 

  I am in Ireland now; now I am at a third
Remove. Not but in all removes I can
Kind love both give and get. Only what word
Wisest my heart breeds dark heaven's baffling ban
Bars or hell's spell thwarts. This to hoard unheard,
Heard unheeded, leaves me a lonely began. 


Most tuneful singer, lover tenderest,
Most sad, most piteous, and most musical,
Thine is the shrine more pilgrim-worn than all
The shrines of singers; high above the rest
Thy trumpet sounds most loud, most manifest.
Yet better were it if a lonely call
Of woodland birds, a song, a madrigal,
Were all the jetsam of thy sea's unrest.

For now thy praises have become too loud
On vulgar lips, and every yelping cur
Yaps thee a paean ; the whiles little men,
Not tall enough to worship in a crowd,
Spit their small wits at thee. Ah ! better then
The broken shrine, the lonely worshipper. 


Convince me to shoot, 
And I will be whole, 
For my shot displeases you, 
Like the innocence of the nation.

Fall and farewell to you, 
The falling of you is signed
By my sins, and your physical act
That is so heavy of your weight.

Fancy my laughter, my jokes, 
That face me everyday, 
Like the lights and sights
So good. 

Let me shoot you now, 
Justice will melt and I will be Hell, 
The heavy fall you suffer
Exacts the crime perfectly. 

To shoot ducks as a sport is
an abomination

Mainly, males thinking it 
enhances manhood

They are the hunters who
are so cruel

To rob nature of a natural
wonder

Flying above to their destiny
but falling mortally wounded

By bullets that no decent man
would fire


To sins I relax my shoulders, 
My heads are two and they are single, 
For I am not evil as can be, 
From sins and religion that bit into flesh, 
Forbidden flesh that clings to the teeth.

Teeth are stolen, and their dice are stronger than more, 
For the sinning is the killing and I know more.
More is the sight and hearing of a good man, 
He is man enough for me. 


To sing in the remotest regions is safe, 
A musical harmony enlightens the very safe.
I sell my goods for profit and hope to gain
From them in the ways of your generosity.
I safely groan, I employ masters for a price, 
The far storms arrive and enjoy me, 
When do the periods of festivity come? 
The price of peace is significant, 
For peaceful men did all their tasks well. 


FAR from our home by Grasmere's quiet Lake,
From the Vale's peace which all her fields partake,
Here on the bleakest point of Cumbria's shore
We sojourn stunned by Ocean's ceaseless roar;
While, day by day, grim neighbour! huge Black Comb
Frowns deepening visibly his native gloom,
Unless, perchance rejecting in despite
What on the Plain 'we' have of warmth and light,
In his own storms he hides himself from sight.
Rough is the time; and thoughts, that would be free 
From heaviness, oft fly, dear Friend, to thee;
Turn from a spot where neither sheltered road
Nor hedge-row screen invites my steps abroad;
Where one poor Plane-tree, having as it might
Attained a stature twice a tall man's height,
Hopeless of further growth, and brown and sere
Through half the summer, stands with top cut sheer,
Like an unshifting weathercock which proves
How cold the quarter that the wind best loves,
Or like a Centinel that, evermore 
Darkening the window, ill defends the door
Of this unfinished house--a Fortress bare,
Where strength has been the Builder's only care;
Whose rugged walls may still for years demand
The final polish of the Plasterer's hand.
--This Dwelling's Inmate more than three weeks space
And oft a Prisoner in the cheerless place,
I--of whose touch the fiddle would complain,
Whose breath would labour at the flute in vain,
In music all unversed, nor blessed with skill 
A bridge to copy, or to paint a mill,
Tired of my books, a scanty company!
And tired of listening to the boisterous sea--
Pace between door and window muttering rhyme,
An old resource to cheat a froward time!
Though these dull hours (mine is it, or their shame?)
Would tempt me to renounce that humble aim.
--But if there be a Muse who, free to take
Her seat upon Olympus, doth forsake
Those heights (like Phoebus when his golden locks 
He veiled, attendant on Thessalian flocks)
And, in disguise, a Milkmaid with her pail
Trips down the pathways of some winding dale;
Or, like a Mermaid, warbles on the shores
To fishers mending nets beside their doors;
Or, Pilgrim-like, on forest moss reclined,
Gives plaintive ditties to the heedless wind,
Or listens to its play among the boughs
Above her head and so forgets her vows--
If such a Visitant of Earth there be 
And she would deign this day to smile on me
And aid my verse, content with local bounds
Of natural beauty and life's daily rounds,
Thoughts, chances, sights, or doings, which we tell
Without reserve to those whom we love well--
Then haply, Beaumont! words in current clear
Will flow, and on a welcome page appear
Duly before thy sight, unless they perish here.
What shall I treat of? News from Mona's Isle?
Such have we, but unvaried in its style; 
No tales of Runagates fresh landed, whence
And wherefore fugitive or on what pretence;
Of feasts, or scandal, eddying like the wind
Most restlessly alive when most confined.
Ask not of me, whose tongue can best appease
The mighty tumults of the HOUSE OF KEYS;
The last year's cup whose Ram or Heifer gained,
What slopes are planted, or what mosses drained:
An eye of fancy only can I cast
On that proud pageant now at hand or past, 
When full five hundred boats in trim array,
With nets and sails outspread and streamers gay,
And chanted hymns and stiller voice of prayer,
For the old Manx-harvest to the Deep repair,
Soon as the herring-shoals at distance shine
Like beds of moonlight shifting on the brine.
Mona from our Abode is daily seen,
But with a wilderness of waves between;
And by conjecture only can we speak
Of aught transacted there in bay or creek; 
No tidings reach us thence from town or field,
Only faint news her mountain sunbeams yield,
And some we gather from the misty air,
And some the hovering clouds, our telegraph, declare.
But these poetic mysteries I withhold;
For Fancy hath her fits both hot and cold,
And should the colder fit with You be on
When You might read, my credit would be gone.
Let more substantial themes the pen engage,
And nearer interests culled from the opening stage 
Of our migration.--Ere the welcome dawn
Had from the east her silver star withdrawn,
The Wain stood ready, at our Cottage-door,
Thoughtfully freighted with a various store;
And long or ere the uprising of the Sun
O'er dew-damped dust our journey was begun,
A needful journey, under favouring skies,
Through peopled Vales; yet something in the guise
Of those old Patriarchs when from well to well
They roamed through Wastes where now the tented Arabs
dwell. 
Say first, to whom did we the charge confide,
Who promptly undertook the Wain to guide
Up many a sharply-twining road and down,
And over many a wide hill's craggy crown,
Through the quick turns of many a hollow nook,
And the rough bed of many an unbridged brook?
A blooming Lass--who in her better hand
Bore a light switch, her sceptre of command
When, yet a slender Girl, she often led,
Skilful and bold, the horse and burthened sled 
From the peat-yielding Moss on Gowdar's head.
What could go wrong with such a Charioteer
For goods and chattels, or those Infants dear,
A Pair who smilingly sate side by side,
Our hope confirming that the salt-sea tide
Whose free embraces we were bound to seek,
Would their lost strength restore and freshen the pale cheek?
Such hope did either Parent entertain
Pacing behind along the silent lane.
Blithe hopes and happy musings soon took flight, 
For lo! an uncouth melancholy sight--
On a green bank a creature stood forlorn
Just half protruded to the light of morn,
Its hinder part concealed by hedge-row thorn
The Figure called to mind a beast of prey
Stript of its frightful powers by slow decay,
And, though no longer upon rapine bent,
Dim memory keeping of its old intent.
We started, looked again with anxious eyes,
And in that griesly object recognise 
The Curate's Dog--his long-tried friend, for they,
As well we knew, together had grown grey.
The Master died, his drooping servant's grief
Found at the Widow's feet some sad relief;
Yet still he lived in pining discontent,
Sadness which no indulgence could prevent;
Hence whole day wanderings, broken nightly sleeps
And lonesome watch that out of doors he keeps;
Not oftentimes, I trust, as we, poor brute!
Espied him on his legs sustained, blank, mute, 
And of all visible motion destitute,
So that the very heaving of his breath
Seemed stopt, though by some other power than death.
Long as we gazed upon the form and face,
A mild domestic pity kept its place,
Unscared by thronging fancies of strange hue
That haunted us in spite of what we knew.
Even now I sometimes think of him as lost
In second-sight appearances, or crost
By spectral shapes of guilt, or to the ground, 
On which he stood, by spells unnatural bound,
Like a gaunt shaggy Porter forced to wait
In days of old romance at Archimago's gate.
Advancing Summer, Nature's law fulfilled,
The choristers in every grove had stilled;
But we, we lacked not music of our own,
For lightsome Fanny had thus early thrown,
Mid the gay prattle of those infant tongues,
Some notes prelusive, from the round of songs
With which, more zealous than the liveliest bird 
That in wild Arden's brakes was ever heard,
Her work and her work's partners she can cheer,
The whole day long, and all days of the year.
Thus gladdened from our own dear Vale we pass
And soon approach Diana's Looking-glass!
To Loughrigg-tarn, round clear and bright as heaven,
Such name Italian fancy would have given,
Ere on its banks the few grey cabins rose
That yet disturb not its concealed repose
More than the feeblest wind that idly blows. 
Ah, Beaumont! when an opening in the road
Stopped me at once by charm of what it showed,
The encircling region vividly exprest
Within the mirror's depth, a world at rest--
Sky streaked with purple, grove and craggy bield,
And the smooth green of many a pendent field,
And, quieted and soothed, a torrent small,
A little daring would-be waterfall,
One chimney smoking and its azure wreath,
Associate all in the calm Pool beneath, 
With here and there a faint imperfect gleam
Of water-lilies veiled in misty steam--
What wonder at this hour of stillness deep,
A shadowy link 'tween wakefulness and sleep,
When Nature's self, amid such blending, seems
To render visible her own soft dreams,
If, mixed with what appeared of rock, lawn, wood,
Fondly embosomed in the tranquil flood,
A glimpse I caught of that Abode, by Thee
Designed to rise in humble privacy, 
A lowly Dwelling, here to be outspread,
Like a small Hamlet, with its bashful head
Half hid in native trees. Alas 'tis not,
Nor ever was; I sighed, and left the spot
Unconscious of its own untoward lot,
And thought in silence, with regret too keen,
Of unexperienced joys that might have been;
Of neighbourhood and intermingling arts,
And golden summer days uniting cheerful hearts.
But time, irrevocable time, is flown. 
And let us utter thanks for blessings sown
And reaped--what hath been, and what is, our own.
Not far we travelled ere a shout of glee,
Startling us all, dispersed my reverie;
Such shout as many a sportive echo meeting
Oft-times from Alpine 'chalets' sends a greeting.
Whence the blithe hail? behold a Peasant stand
On high, a kerchief waving in her hand!
Not unexpectant that by early day
Our little Band would thrid this mountain way, 
Before her cottage on the bright hill side
She hath advanced with hope to be descried.
Right gladly answering signals we displayed,
Moving along a tract of morning shade,
And vocal wishes sent of like good will
To our kind Friend high on the sunny hill--
Luminous region, fair as if the prime
Were tempting all astir to look aloft or climb;
Only the centre of the shining cot
With door left open makes a gloomy spot, 
Emblem of those dark corners sometimes found
Within the happiest breast on earthly ground.
Rich prospect left behind of stream and vale,
And mountain-tops, a barren ridge we scale;
Descend, and reach, in Yewdale's depths, a plain
With haycocks studded, striped with yellowing grain--
An area level as a Lake and spread
Under a rock too steep for man to tread,
Where sheltered from the north and bleak northwest
Aloft the Raven hangs a visible nest, 
Fearless of all assaults that would her brood molest.
Hot sunbeams fill the steaming vale; but hark,
At our approach, a jealous watch-dog's bark,
Noise that brings forth no liveried Page of state,
But the whole household, that our coming wait.
With Young and Old warm greetings we exchange,
And jocund smiles, and toward the lowly Grange
Press forward by the teasing dogs unscared.
Entering, we find the morning meal prepared:
So down we sit, though not till each had cast 
Pleased looks around the delicate repast--
Rich cream, and snow-white eggs fresh from the nest,
With amber honey from the mountain's breast;
Strawberries from lane or woodland, offering wild
Of children's industry, in hillocks piled;
Cakes for the nonce, and butter fit to lie
Upon a lordly dish; frank hospitality
Where simple art with bounteous nature vied,
And cottage comfort shuned not seemly pride.
Kind Hostess! Handmaid also of the feast, 
If thou be lovelier than the kindling East,
Words by thy presence unrestrained may speak
Of a perpetual dawn from brow and cheek
Instinct with light whose sweetest promise lies,
Never retiring, in thy large dark eyes,
Dark but to every gentle feeling true,
As if their lustre flowed from ether's purest blue.
Let me not ask what tears may have been wept
By those bright eyes, what weary vigils kept,
Beside that hearth what sighs may have been heaved 
For wounds inflicted, nor what toil relieved
By fortitude and patience, and the grace
Of heaven in pity visiting the place.
Not unadvisedly those secret springs
I leave unsearched: enough that memory clings,
Here as elsewhere, to notices that make
Their own significance for hearts awake,
To rural incidents, whose genial powers
Filled with delight three summer morning hours.
More cold my pen report of grave or gay 
That through our gipsy travel cheered the way;
But, bursting forth above the waves, the Sun
Laughs at my pains, and seems to say, 'Be done.'
Yet, Beaumont, thou wilt not, I trust, reprove
This humble offering made by Truth to Love,
Nor chide the Muse that stooped to break a spell
Which might have else been on me yet:


To slump and slay shall be the decision, 
To get the rest needs rest itself, as the basket
Is carried by the limped workers.
Sleep pokes at you from the higher reaches, 
Positions of splendour exist for those who wait
And persevere like the bison and cattle of that nation.


It rests on a premise, and it rests on splendour, 
For hearts may conquer the beloved, 
He revolves around a circle 
And the circle revolves around him, 
Holding a foot with a hand
And a hand made useful feet. 


O SOFT embalmer of the still midnight!
Shutting, with careful fingers and benign,
Our gloom-pleas'd eyes, embower'd from the light,
     Enshaded in forgetfulness divine;
O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close,
     In midst of this thine hymn, my willing eyes.
Or wait the Amen, ere thy poppy throws
     Around my bed its lulling charities;
     Then save me, or the passed day will shine
Upon my pillow, breeding many woes;
     Save me from curious conscience, that still hoards
Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole;
     Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards,
And seal the hushed casket of my soul.


Ah, Sleep, to me thou com'st not in the guise
Of one who brings good gifts to weary men,
Balm for bruised hearts and fancies alien
To unkind truth, and drying for sad eyes.
I dread the summons to that fierce assize
Of all my foes and woes, that waits me when
Thou mak'st my soul the unwilling denizen
Of thy dim troubled house where unrest lies.

My soul is sick with dreaming, let it rest.
False Sleep, thou hast conspired with Wakefulness,
I will not praise thee, I too long beguiled
With idle tales. Where is thy soothing breast ?
Thy peace, thy poppies, thy forgetfulness ?
Where is thy lap for me so tired a child 



To sleep
perchance to.  

snore! 

I can only dream
of peaceful sleep
you've murdered sleep.

My sleep! 
Ay, there's the rub! 

I lie awake
misquoting Shakespeare


to myself. 


O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell, 
     Let it not be among the jumbled heap 
     Of murky buildings; climb with me the steep, -- 
Nature's observatory -- whence the dell, 
Its flowery slopes, its river's crystal swell, 
     May seem a span; let me thy vigils keep 
     'Mongst boughs pavilion'd, where the deer's swift leap 
Startles the wild bee from the foxglove bell. 
But though I'll gladly trace these scenes with thee, 
     Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind, 
     Whose words are images of thoughts refin'd, 
Is my soul's pleasure; and it sure must be 
     Almost the highest bliss of human-kind, 
When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee. 


What though while the wonders of nature exploring, 
I cannot your light, mazy footsteps attend; 
Nor listen to accents, that almost adoring, 
Bless Cynthia's face, the enthusiast’s friend: 

Yet over the steep, whence the mountain stream rushes, 
With you, kindest friends, in idea I rove; 
Mark the clear tumbling crystal, its passionate gushes, 
Its spray that the wild flower kindly bedews. 

Why linger you so, the wild labyrinth strolling? 
Why breathless, unable your bliss to declare? 
Ah! you list to the nightingale’s tender condoling, 
Responsive to sylphs, in the moon beamy air. 

'Tis morn, and the flowers with dew are yet drooping, 
I see you are treading the verge of the sea: 
And now! ah, I see it--you just now are stooping 
To pick up the keep-sake intended for me. 

If a cherub, on pinions of silver descending, 
Had brought me a gem from the fret-work of heaven; 
And smiles, with his star-cheering voice sweetly blending, 
The blessings of Tighe had melodiously given; 

It had not created a warmer emotion 
Than the present, fair nymphs, I was blest with from you 
Than the shell, from the bright golden sands of the ocean 
Which the emerald waves at your feet gladly threw. 


For, indeed, 'tis a sweet and peculiar pleasure, 
(And blissful is he who such happiness finds,) 
To possess but a span of the hour of leisure, 
In elegant, pure, and aerial minds. 

The limbs of the saviour congratulate me 
Since they are drunken with stupid words
Vilifying my actions then rescuing me.

The curious men among us stridently condemn me, 
For my limbs are in limbo
Inwardly afire.


See the intrigue of the drum we call peace, 
After the fires of our whims have sung, 
The intrigue of day falling connects with my light soul.

I see with an interim, the grasped landscape
Of solutions and metaphors, 
The relaxed splendour of our own majesty.

This intercourse with the crests and troughs of life
Are like the seas and lands together, 
For even mountains of hatred condemn me.

To be brief is to be life, inward barriers must collide, 
And depart to the fore forming Me in reactions, 
This to malign the mollifying spirit. 


I.
Thou art fair, and few are fairer
Of the Nymphs of earth or ocean;
They are robes that fit the wearer--
Those soft limbs of thine, whose motion
Ever falls and shifts and glances 
As the life within them dances.

II.
Thy deep eyes, a double Planet,
Gaze the wisest into madness
With soft clear fire,--the winds that fan it
Are those thoughts of tender gladness
Which, like zephyrs on the billow,
Make thy gentle soul their pillow.

III.
If, whatever face thou paintest
In those eyes, grows pale with pleasure,
If the fainting soul is faintest 
When it hears thy harp’s wild measure,
Wonder not that when thou speakest
Of the weak my heart is weakest.

IV.
As dew beneath the wind of morning,
As the sea which whirlwinds waken,
As the birds at thunder’s warning,
As aught mute yet deeply shaken,
As one who feels an unseen spirit
Is my heart when thine is near it.


'It is the future generation that presses into being by means of
these exuberant feelings and supersensible soap bubbles of ours.'
- Schopenhauer

'The hot night makes us keep our bedroom windows open.
Our magnolia blossoms. Life begins to happen.
My hopped up husband drops his home disputes,
and hits the streets to cruise for prostitutes,
free-lancing out along the razor's edge.
This screwball might kill his wife, then take the pledge.
Oh the monotonous meanness of his lust. 
It's the injustice.  he is so unjust- 
whiskey-blind, swaggering home at five.
My only thought is how to keep alive.
What makes him tick? Each night now I tie
ten dollars and his car key to my thigh
Gored by the climacteric of his want,
he stalls above me like an elephant.


'Up to the end of the year stay put, 
Living in a twist of the atmosphere, stay put.

I gather words and breath of oxygen, 
Indeed the stay on Earth is to adhere, stay put.

My empire needs growing every day, 
This garden of the soul can appear and stay put.

The air is eerie and cool, once a day, 
The nights are clear with the biosphere, they stay put.

The slumber of ooze is such that the night is dear, 
When years function I am absent with beer, just stay put.

You must decide the life to fetch and burrow, 
A year takes shape, my enemy is to disappear, I still stay put. 


While, Stella, to your lasting praise
The Muse her annual tribute pays,
While I assign myself a task
Which you expect, but scorn to ask;
If I perform this task with pain,
Let me of partial fate complain;
You every year the debt enlarge,
I grow less equal to the charge:
In you each virtue brighter shines,
But my poetic vein declines;
My harp will soon in vain be strung,
And all your virtues left unsung.
For none among the upstart race
Of poets dare assume my place;
Your worth will be to them unknown,
They must have Stellas of their own;
And thus, my stock of wit decay'd,
I dying leave the debt unpaid,
Unless Delany, as my heir,
Will answer for the whole arrear. 

Pallas, observing Stella's wit
Was more than for her sex was fit,
And that her beauty, soon or late,
Might breed confusion in the state,
In high concern for human kind,
Fix'd honour in her infant mind.
But (not in wrangling to engage
With such a stupid, vicious age)
If honour I would here define,
It answers faith in things divine.
As natural life the body warms,
And, scholars teach, the soul informs,
So honour animates the whole,
And is the spirit of the soul.
Those numerous virtues which the tribe
Of tedious moralists describe,
And by such various titles call,
True honour comprehends them all.
Let melancholy rule supreme,
Choler preside, or blood, or phlegm,
It makes no difference in the case,
Nor is complexion honour's place.
But, lest we should for honour take
The drunken quarrels of a rake:
Or think it seated in a scar,
Or on a proud triumphal car;
Or in the payment of a debt
We lose with sharpers at piquet;
Or when a whore, in her vocation,
Keeps punctual to an assignation;
Or that on which his lordship swears,
When vulgar knaves would lose their ears;
Let Stella's fair example preach
A lesson she alone can teach.
In points of honour to be tried,
All passions must be laid aside:
Ask no advice, but think alone;
Suppose the question not your own.
How shall I act, is not the case;
But how would Brutus in my place?
In such a case would Cato bleed?
And how would Socrates proceed?
Drive all objections from your mind,
Else you relapse to human kind:
Ambition, avarice, and lust,
A factious rage, and breach of trust,
And flattery tipt with nauseous fleer,
And guilty shame, and servile fear,
Envy, and cruelty, and pride,
Will in your tainted heart preside.
Heroes and heroines of old,
By honour only were enroll'd
Among their brethren in the skies,
To which (though late) shall Stella rise.
Ten thousand oaths upon record
Are not so sacred as her word:
The world shall in its atoms end,
Ere Stella can deceive a friend.
By honour seated in her breast
She still determines what is best:
What indignation in her mind
Against enslavers of mankind!
Base kings, and ministers of state,
Eternal objects of her hate!
She thinks that nature ne'er design'd
Courage to man alone confined.
Can cowardice her sex adorn,
Which most exposes ours to scorn?
She wonders where the charm appears
In Florimel's affected fears;
For Stella never learn'd the art
At proper times to scream and start;
Nor calls up all the house at night,
And swears she saw a thing in white.
Doll never flies to cut her lace,
Or throw cold water in her face,
Because she heard a sudden drum,
Or found an earwig in a plum.
Her hearers are amazed from whence
Proceeds that fund of wit and sense;
Which, though her modesty would shroud,
Breaks like the sun behind a cloud;
While gracefulness its art conceals,
And yet through every motion steals.
Say, Stella, was Prometheus blind,
And, forming you, mistook your kind?
No; 'twas for you alone he stole
The fire that forms a manly soul;
Then, to complete it every way,
He moulded it with female clay:
To that you owe the nobler flame,
To this the beauty of your frame.
How would Ingratitude delight,
And how would Censure glut her spite,
If I should Stella's kindness hide
In silence, or forget with pride!
When on my sickly couch I lay,
Impatient both of night and day,
Lamenting in unmanly strains,
Call'd every power to ease my pains;
Then Stella ran to my relief,
With cheerful face and inward grief;
And, though by Heaven's severe decree
She suffers hourly more than me,
No cruel master could require,
From slaves employ'd for daily hire,
What Stella, by her friendship warm'd
With vigour and delight perform'd:
My sinking spirits now supplies
With cordials in her hands and eyes:
Now with a soft and silent tread
Unheard she moves about my bed.
I see her taste each nauseous draught,
And so obligingly am caught;
I bless the hand from whence they came,
Nor dare distort my face for shame.
Best pattern of true friends! beware;
You pay too dearly for your care,
If, while your tenderness secures
My life, it must endanger yours;
For such a fool was never found,
Who pull'd a palace to the ground,
Only to have the ruins made
Materials for a house decay'd. 

As, when a lofty pile is raised,
We never hear the workmen praised,
Who bring the lime, or place the stones;
But all admire Inigo Jones:
So, if this pile of scattered rhymes
Should be approved in aftertimes;
If it both pleases and endures,
The merit and the praise are yours.
Thou, Stella, wert no longer young,
When first for thee my harp was strung,
Without one word of Cupid's darts,
Of killing eyes, or bleeding hearts;
With friendship and esteem possest,
I ne'er admitted Love a guest.
In all the habitudes of life,
The friend, the mistress, and the wife,
Variety we still pursue,
In pleasure seek for something new;
Or else, comparing with the rest,
Take comfort that our own is best;
The best we value by the worst,
As tradesmen show their trash at first;
But his pursuits are at an end,
Whom Stella chooses for a friend.
A poet starving in a garret,
Invokes his mistress and his Muse,
And stays at home for want of shoes:
Should but his Muse descending drop
A slice of bread and mutton-chop;
Or kindly, when his credit's out,
Surprise him with a pint of stout;
Or patch his broken stocking soles;
Or send him in a peck of coals;
Exalted in his mighty mind,
He flies and leaves the stars behind;
Counts all his labours amply paid,
Adores her for the timely aid.
Or, should a porter make inquiries
For Chloe, Sylvia, Phillis, Iris;
Be told the lodging, lane, and sign,
The bowers that hold those nymphs divine;
Fair Chloe would perhaps be found
With footmen tippling under ground;
The charming Sylvia beating flax,
Her shoulders marked with bloody tracks;
Bright Phyllis mending ragged smocks:
And radiant Iris in the pox.
These are the goddesses enrolled
In Curll's collection, new and old,
Whose scoundrel fathers would not know 'em,
If they should meet them in a poem.
True poets can depress and raise,
Are lords of infamy and praise;
They are not scurrilous in satire,
Nor will in panegyric flatter.
Unjustly poets we asperse;
Truth shines the brighter clad in verse,
And all the fictions they pursue
Do but insinuate what is true.
Now, should my praises owe their truth
To beauty, dress, or paint, or youth,
What stoics call without our power,
They could not be ensured an hour;
'Twere grafting on an annual stock,
That must our expectation mock,
And, making one luxuriant shoot,
Die the next year for want of root:
Before I could my verses bring,
Perhaps you're quite another thing.
So Maevius, when he drained his skull
To celebrate some suburb trull,
His similes in order set,
And every crambo he could get;
Had gone through all the common-places
Worn out by wits, who rhyme on faces;
Before he could his poem close,
The lovely nymph had lost her nose.
Your virtues safely I commend;
They on no accidents depend:
Let malice look with all her eyes,
She dare not say the poet lies.
Stella, when you these lines transcribe,
Lest you should take them for a bribe,
Resolved to mortify your pride,
I'll here expose your weaker side.
Your spirits kindle to a flame,
Moved by the lightest touch of blame;
And when a friend in kindness tries
To show you where your error lies,
Conviction does but more incense;
Perverseness is your whole defence;
Truth, judgment, wit, give place to spite,
Regardless both of wrong and right;
Your virtues all suspended wait,
Till time has opened reason's gate;
And, what is worse, your passion bends
Its force against your nearest friends,
Which manners, decency, and pride,

Have taught from you the world to hide;
In vain; for see, your friend has brought
To public light your only fault;
And yet a fault we often find
Mixed in a noble, generous mind:
And may compare to Etna's fire,
Which, though with trembling, all admire;
The heat that makes the summit glow,
Enriching all the vales below.
Those who, in warmer climes, complain
From Phoebus' rays they suffer pain,
Must own that pain is largely paid
By generous wines beneath a shade.
Yet, when I find your passions rise,
And anger sparkling in your eyes,
I grieve those spirits should be spent,
For nobler ends by nature meant.
One passion, with a different turn,
Makes wit inflame, or anger burn:
So the sun's heat, with different powers,
Ripens the grape, the liquor sours:
Thus Ajax, when with rage possest,
By Pallas breathed into his breast,
His valour would no more employ,
Which might alone have conquered Troy;
But, blinded be resentment, seeks
For vengeance on his friends the Greeks.
You think this turbulence of blood
From stagnating preserves the flood,
Which, thus fermenting by degrees,
Exalts the spirits, sinks the lees.
Stella, for once your reason wrong;
For, should this ferment last too long,
By time subsiding, you may find
Nothing but acid left behind;
From passion you may then be freed,
When peevishness and spleen succeed.
Say, Stella, when you copy next,
Will you keep strictly to the text?
Dare you let these reproaches stand,
And to your failing set your hand?
Or, if these lines your anger fire,
Shall they in baser flames expire?
Whene'er they burn, if burn they must,
They'll prove my accusation just. 

To take a chance breaking your leg
Is futile and obsolete an act; 
The sort of complexion found in laughter
Is an arm of the meal called breakfast.
Living among the rich found me heaven, 
Keeping these bound to torture 
As the keeper of fire was abiding here.
To wound around forty on the rope
Was considered a displeasure
Of the righteous actions not so.

I slept all night in the whole physics
And chemistry, 
The whole of science bloomed with flowering
Plants that coincided with lightning
And the thunder following.
Excuse the wrong manners from above, 
Pickings are rare and well educated. 

To take his place you are against him, 
Three more rushed to take his muscle, 
His hands were on his head and they were big, 
His hands shook like feathers and more.
Many escaped and exposed their face, 
Like a captain stepping closer.
Because that’s the name of science, 
As if an old woman snarls and purses her mouth
From an awe or thought, an action.
All we had was more knowledge, 
Kicking its madness and skimming the pages
Of thought. 

Truly My Satan thou art but a Dunce
And dost not know the Garment from the Man
Every Harlot was a Virgin once
Nor canst thou ever change Kate into Nan

Tho thou art Worship'd by the Names Divine 
The Son of Morn in weary Nights decline
The lost Travellers Dream under the Hill


Your peaks are beautiful, ye Apennines!
In the soft light of these serenest skies;
From the broad highland region, black with pines,
Fair as the hills of Paradise they rise,
Bathed in the tint Peruvian slaves behold
In rosy flushes on the virgin gold.

There, rooted to the aerial shelves that wear
The glory of a brighter world, might spring
Sweet flowers of heaven to scent the unbreathed air,
And heaven's fleet messengers might rest the wing,
To view the fair earth in its summer sleep,
Silent, and cradled by the glimmering deep.

Below you lie men's sepulchres, the old
Etrurian tombs, the graves of yesterday;
The herd's white bones lie mixed with human mould--
Yet up the radiant steeps that I survey
Death never climbed, nor life's soft breath, with pain,
Was yielded to the elements again.

Ages of war have filled these plains with fear;
How oft the hind has started at the clash
Of spears, and yell of meeting, armies here,
Or seen the lightning of the battle flash
From clouds, that rising with the thunder's sound,
Hung like an earth-born tempest o'er the ground!

Ah me! what armed nations--Asian horde,
And Libyan host--the Scythian and the Gaul,
Have swept your base and through your passes poured,
Like ocean-tides uprising at the call
Of tyrant winds--against your rocky side
The bloody billows dashed, and howled, and died.

How crashed the towers before beleaguering foes,
Sacked cities smoked and realms were rent in twain;
And commonwealths against their rivals rose,
Trode out their lives and earned the curse of Cain!
While in the noiseless air and light that flowed
Round your far brows, eternal Peace abode.

Here pealed the impious hymn, and altar flames
Rose to false gods, a dream-begotten throng,
Jove, Bacchus, Pan, and earlier, fouler names;
While, as the unheeding ages passed along,
Ye, from your station in the middle skies,
Proclaimed the essential Goodness, strong and wise.

In you the heart that sighs for freedom seeks
Her image; there the winds no barrier know,
Clouds come and rest and leave your fairy peaks;
While even the immaterial Mind, below,
And thought, her winged offspring, chained by power,
Pine silently for the redeeming hour. 


Beachcomber on the shores of tears
Limning the gestures of defeat
In dancers, whores, and opera-stars –
The lonely, lighted various street

You sauntered through, oblique, perverse,
In your home territory a spy,
Accosted you and with a curse
You froze it with your Gorgon’s eye.

With what tense patience you refine
The everyness of everyday
And with free colour and a line
Make my mysteries of flaccid clay!

By what strange enterprise you live!
Edgy, insatiably alone,
You choose your tenderness to give
To showgirls whom you turn to stone –

But stone that moves, tired stone that leans
To ease involuntarily the toe
Of ballet-girls like watering-cans
(Those arguers at the bar) as though

In their brief pause you found relief
From posed dilemmas of the mind-
Your grudging aristocratic grief,
The wildcat cares of going blind.

Well, walk your evening streets and look
Each last eleven at the show:
The darkening pleasures you forsook
Look back like burning windows now. 


By Sylvia if thy charming self be meant;
If friendship be thy virgin vows' extent,
O! let me in Aminta's praises join,
Hers my esteem shall be, my passion thine.
When for thy head the garland I prepare,
A second wreath shall bind Aminta's hair;
And when my choicest songs thy worth proclaim,
Alternate verse shall bless Aminta's name; 
My heart shall own the justice of her cause,
And Love himself submit to Friendship's laws.
But if beneath thy numbers' soft disguise
Some favour'd swain, some true Alexis, lies;
If Amaryllis breathes thy secret pains,
And thy fond heart beats measure to thy strains,
May'st thou, howe'er I grieve, for ever find
The flame propitious and the lover kind;
May Venus long exert her happy power,
And make thy beauty like thy verse endure:
May every god his friendly aid afford,
Pan guard thy flock, and Ceres bless thy board.
But if, by chance, the series of thy joys
Permit one thought less cheerful to arise,
Piteous transfer it to the mournful swain,
Who loving much, who not beloved again,
Feels an ill-fated passion's last excess,
And dies in wo that thou may'st live in peace. 


HOW, Liberty! girl, can it be by thee nam'd?
Equality too! hussey, art not asham'd?
Free and Equal indeed, while mankind thou enchainest,
And over their hearts a proud Despot so reignest. 


Blest were he, O Bio-Bio!
Who could dwell forevermore
In a deep grove, cool and shady,
Upon thine enchanted shore!

Just a lowly thatched-roofed cottage
Where thy limpid waters are seen
Pouring their calm flood in silence
Amid foliage fresh and green;

Where, instead of shifting changes
In the fickle things of state,
Wind-stirred oaks and maitens murmur,
And the forest peace is great;

Where the bird amid the branches,
In the early dawning gray,
Sings its untaught, artless music,
Greeting thus the new-born day.

In that humble thatched-roof cottage,
Oh, how happy were my lot,
In the peace that nothing troubles,
Envied not and envying not!

This to me in truth were sweeter
Than the Babel wild and loud
Where in chase of a chimera
All are rushing in a crowd;

Where dark treachery and falsehood
Near the quaking altar stay
That the people's favor raises
To the idols of a day.

Sweet repose, most blissful quiet,
Earthly paradise divine!
Has the palm of war or wisdom
Worth which can outrival thine?

Truth I love, not adulation—
Truth all unadorned and plain,
Not the clamorous applauses
That are raised in Fortune's train.

Growing old, for that false treasure
I would cease my soul to fret—
Say 'Farewell to disappointments!
The forgetful I forget.

'Others call excitement pleasure,
Madly seeking fame or pelf;
I in earth's most hidden corner
Wish to live now for myself.'


I used to be afraid of you, 
heard you eat up girls and boys.
I didn't want the lights turned out
and I was scared to play with toys.

Then Mommy asked you over.
She told me you're just sad.
You have no one to play with
and you aren't really bad.

You never come to dinner.
We still set a place for you, 
a plate, a spoon, a glass for milk, 
just in case you do. 

To the bright east she flies,
Brothers of Paradise
Remit her home,
Without a change of wings,
Or Love's convenient things,
Enticed to come.

Fashioning what she is,
Fathoming what she was,
We deem we dream - 
And that dissolves the days
Through which existence strays
Homeless at home. 


What charms you have, from what high race you sprung,
Have been the pleasing subjects of my song:
Unskill'd and young, yet something still I writ 
Of Ca'ndish' beauty, join'd to Cecil's wit.
But when you please to show the labouring muse
What greater theme your music can produce,
My babbling praises I repeat no more,
But hear, rejoice, stand silent, and adore.
The Persians thus, first gazing on the sun,
Admired how high 'twas placed, how bright it shone;
But as his power was known their thoughts were raised,
And soon they worshipp'd what at first they praised.
Eliza's glory lives in Spenser's song,
And Cowley's verse keeps fair Orinda young;
That as in birth and beauty you excel,
The muse might dictate and the poet tell:
Your art no other art can speak; and you 
To show how well you play, must play anew:
Your music's power your music must disclose,
For what light is 'tis only light that shows.
Strange force of harmony that thus controls
Our thoughts, and turns and sanctifies our souls. 
While with its utmost art your sex could move 
Our wonder only or at best our love,
You far above both these your god did place,
That your high power might worldly thoughts destroy,
That with your numbers you our zeal might raise,
And like himself communicate your joy. 
When to your native heaven you shall repair,
And with your presence crown the blessings there,
Your lute may wind its strings but little higher
To tune their notes to that immortal quire.
Your art is perfect here; your numbers do
More than our books make the rude atheist know
That there's a heaven by what he hears below. 
A cunning angel came and drew the rest,
So when you play, some godhead does impart
Harmonious aid; divinity helps art;
Some cherub finishes what you begun, 
And to a miracle improves a tune.
To burning Rome when frantic Nero play'd,
Viewing that face, no more he had survey'd
The raging flames, but, struck with strange surprise,
Confess'd them less than those of Anna's eyes;
But, had he heard thy lute, he soon had found
His rage eluded and his crime atoned:
Thine, like Amphion's hand, had waked the stone
And from destruction call'd the rising town;
Malice to music had been forced to yield,
Nor could he burn so fast as thou couldst build. 


You are with me in grief and happiness, 
You are with me in joy and loneliness, 
You are the One who gives me shelter and support, 
You are my love and my reward.
You are the beginning of all and the end, 
There is no one you ever offend.
You are my consolation, 
You are my celebration, 
You are my light
In the dark night.
In my perishable heart
I find the answers with your help, 
You tell me which door to open, 
You tell me how to dwell.
You tell me: 
The sense of life is in one word: 
Trust, 
You tell me: 
Don’t fuss, be cussed! 
I can see my reflection in my children, 
It means I am needed on this Land.


I follow you for many years, 
And still i don’t remember, 
What you are? 
Well recently i found, 
 
After surviving your pesters, 
Now i outbreak to say, 
For heaven’s sake
Put down your pen.

I wonder why you stopped me once, 
And asked, what book i have read recently.
What will you understand? 

I only tried to say, 
Dark man, dark man. 
Mind your business, 
And you started writing.


I accept Shakespeare, Dante, 
Russell, Eliot and Chekov, 
To be great writers, 
But not you.  You dark man! 
You are an obnoxious writer, 
Trying to amuse with your trivialities.
The jokes that you crack, 
And with the words that you play, 
Honestly. 
I don’t even smile man.
It is time, 
You drop down your pen, 
And pull out the weeds.
Don’t try to make your progenies, 
Write commentaries on cricket, 
It; s still worse and nauseating.
Take my advice, 
For goodness’ sake, 
Stop writing, 
And go to bed.
It is not time for you to wake up, 
I will definitely let you know, 
When you grow up.



You, the omnivorous

Eating our days and nights
Drinking our rivers and seas
Biting our present and future
sucking our hopes and dreams
Licking our lands and sky

Laughing demon you are
And your desire

We thought you a deity
We couldn't recognize you

But new generation would come to
Make your monument of hatred. 

you did not know you were Afrika

When you set out for Afrika
you did not know you were going.
Because
you did not know you were Afrika.
You did not know the Black continent
that had to be reached
was you.

I could not have told you then that some sun
would come,
somewhere over the road,
would come evoking the diamonds
of you, the Black continent--
somewhere over the road.
You would not have believed my mouth.


When I told you, meeting you somewhere close
to the heat and youth of the road,
liking my loyalty, liking belief,
you smiled and you thanked me but very little believed me.

Here is some sun. Some.
Now off into the places rough to reach.
Though dry, though drowsy, all unwillingly a-wobble,
into the dissonant and dangerous crescendo.
Your work, that was done, to be done to be done to be done. 

Gloomy and dark art thou, O chief of the mighty Omahas;
Gloomy and dark as the driving cloud, whose name thou hast taken!
Wrapt in thy scarlet blanket, I see thee stalk through the city's
Narrow and populous streets, as once by the margin of rivers
Stalked those birds unknown, that have left us only their
footprints.
What, in a few short years, will remain of thy race but the
footprints?

How canst thou walk these streets, who hast trod the green turf
of the prairies!
How canst thou breathe this air, who hast breathed the sweet air
of the mountains!
Ah! 't is in vain that with lordly looks of disdain thou dost
challenge
Looks of disdain in return,, and question these walls and these
pavements,
Claiming the soil for thy hunting-grounds, while down-trodden
millions
Starve in the garrets of Europe, and cry from its caverns that
they, too,
Have been created heirs of the earth, and claim its division!

Back, then, back to thy woods in the regions west of the Wabash!
There as a monarch thou reignest.  In autumn the leaves of the
maple
Pave the floors of thy palace-halls with gold, and in summer
Pine-trees waft through its chambers the odorous breath of their
branches.
There thou art strong and great, a hero, a tamer of horses!
There thou chasest the stately stag on the banks of the Elkhorn,
Or by the roar of the Running-Water, or where the Omaha
Calls thee, and leaps through the wild ravine like a brave of the
Blackfeet!

Hark! what murmurs arise from the heart of those mountainous
deserts?
Is it the cry of the Foxes and Crows, or the mighty Behemoth,
Who, unharmed, on his tusks once caught the bolts of the thunder,
And now lurks in his lair to destroy the race of the red man?
Far more fatal to thee and thy race than the Crows and the Foxes,
Far more fatal to thee and thy race than the tread of Behemoth,
Lo! the big thunder-canoe, that steadily breasts the Missouri's
Merciless current! and yonder, afar on the prairies, the
camp-fires
Gleam through the night; and the cloud of dust in the gray of the
daybreak
Marks not the buffalo's track, nor the Mandan's dexterous
horse-race;
It is a caravan, whitening the desert where dwell the Camanches!
Ha! how the breath of these Saxons and Celts, like the blast of
the east-wind,
Drifts evermore to the west the scanty smokes of thy wigwams


Dream fluently, still brothers, who when young
Took with your mother's milk the mother tongue,

In which pure matrix, joining world and mind,
You strove to leave some line of verse behind

Like still fresh tracks across a field of snow,
Not reckoning that all could melt and go. 


Thou fair-haired angel of the evening,
Now, whilst the sun rests on the mountains, light
Thy bright torch of love; thy radiant crown
Put on, and smile upon our evening bed!
Smile on our loves, and while thou drawest the
Blue curtains of the sky, scatter thy silver dew
On every flower that shuts its sweet eyes
In timely sleep. Let thy west wing sleep on
The lake; speak silence with thy glimmering eyes,
And wash the dusk with silver. Soon, full soon,
Dost thou withdraw; then the wolf rages wide,
And the lion glares through the dun forest.
The fleeces of our flocks are covered with
Thy sacred dew; protect with them with thine influence. 

Fair lovely Maid, or if that Title be
Too weak, too Feminine for Nobler thee,
Permit a Name that more Approaches Truth:
And let me call thee, Lovely Charming Youth.
This last will justifie my soft complaint,
While that may serve to lessen my constraint;
And without Blushes I the Youth persue,
When so much beauteous Woman is in view.
Against thy Charms we struggle but in vain
With thy deluding Form thou giv'st us pain,
While the bright Nymph betrays us to the Swain.
In pity to our Sex sure thou wer't sent,
That we might Love, and yet be Innocent:
For sure no Crime with thee we can commit;
Or if we shou'd - thy Form excuses it.
For who, that gathers fairest Flowers believes
A Snake lies hid beneath the Fragrant Leaves.

Though beauteous Wonder of a different kind,
Soft Cloris with the dear Alexis join'd;
When e'er the Manly part of thee, wou'd plead
Though tempts us with the Image of the Maid,
While we the noblest Passions do extend
The Love to Hermes, Aphrodite the Friend. 

v


O fighters, where are you all? 
Awake again with your clarion call, 
For real freedom of this land, 
To move towards hands in hand.

O the fighters, awake and raise yours voice
Like a thunder upon the mass and stop all noise, 
What you dreamt of and what we see! 
Hunger, injustice and riots.  infront of thee.
You cannot stand still like a stone, 
Come again, with all might that you shone.
Your dreams are dying as days pass, 
Became foul and rotten to the mass.
Leaders born- all are fake, 
They do all for their sake, 
Loot money, do injustice and what not! 
Live a luxury and travel a lot.
Here we poor mass cry for food, 
There they do all what seem good.
We have none to hear our voice, 
Fruitless all cries, die our noise.
We dream of you  in summer like a rain, 
O saviours of the land, come again. 


Thou blossom bright with autumn dew, 
And colored with the heaven's own blue, 
That openest when the quiet light 
Succeeds the keen and frosty night. 

Thou comest not when violets lean 
O'er wandering brooks and springs unseen, 
Or columbines, in purple dressed, 
Nod o'er the ground-bird's hidden nest. 

Thou waitest late and com'st alone, 
When woods are bare and birds are flown, 
And frosts and shortening days portend 
The aged year is near his end. 

Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye 
Look through its fringes to the sky, 
Blue--blue--as if that sky let fall 
A flower from its cerulean wall. 

I would that thus, when I shall see 
The hour of death draw near to me, 
Hope, blossoming within my heart, 
May look to heaven as I depart. 

my neck wreathed with rosebuds,
my head filled with visions of infants,
my palms open to your silver nails,
my eyes open to your rays of illumination,
my vagina & my womb gaping
to be filled by your radiance

O goddess, I would be a worthy vessel.


Impermanence- all is impermanence.
The cock rises to fall again;
the woman fills only to empty
in a convulsion that shakes the world;
the poet grows to become a voice
only to lose that voice when death takes her.
A stroke cancels her upon the page-
& yet I open her book & a chill wind blows from eternity.

wreathed in tears, in losses, in whistling winds.
I wrap the witch's herbs around my neck
to ward off the impermanence that is our common fate.
The herbs dry & crumble,
as my face grows the map of my anxieties,
& my daughter leaps up like a vine
twining around the trellis of impermanence.

O goddess, teach me to praise loss,
death & the passing of all things- for from this flux
I know your blessings flow. 

As is your name, so is your comely face
Touch'd every where with such diffused grace,
As that in all that admirable round,
There is not one least solecism found;
And as that part, so every portion else
Keeps line for line with beauty's parallels. 


I wanted to be sure to reach you;
though my ship was on the way it got caught
in some moorings. I am always tying up
and then deciding to depart. In storms and
at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide
around my fathomless arms, I am unable
to understand the forms of my vanity
or I am hard alee with my Polish rudder
in my hand and the sun sinking. To
you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage
of my will. The terrible channels where
the wind drives me against the brown lips
of the reeds are not all behind me. Yet
I trust the sanity of my vessel; and
if it sinks it may well be in answer
to the reasoning of the eternal voices,
the waves which have kept me from reaching you. 

Not confident Eros of his look of deep purple
out of his own excitment, 
scared of calling to mind running blood's memories
changed his colour not to astound, 
not to be thought  approaching red fiery flood.
Disguised the untrusted purple into yellow wanness
tο cover the  igneus thrill under accessible excuse
and thus to rely on the advantage  of a bashful lover.
Positive the reaction to the purified provoking scarlet.
Delighted, moved  on  the critical step: 
Let himself fall
into the lap of the awaiting pretext, 
into the adventure
of the flaming
to the heaven process. 


Howe'er, 'tis well that, while mankind
Through fate's perverse meander errs,
He can imagined pleasures find 
To combat against real cares.

Fancies and notions he pursues,
Which ne'er had being but in thought;
Each, like the Grecian artist, wooes,
The image he himself has wrought.

Against experience he believes;
He argues against demonstration:
Pleased when his reason he deceives,
And sets his judgement by his passion.

The hoary fool, who many days
Has struggled with continued sorrow,
Renew's his hope, and blindly lays
The desperate bet upon to-morrow.

To-morrow comes: 'tis noon, 'tis night:
This day like all the former flies;
Yet on he runs to seek delight
To-morrow, till to-night he dies.

Our hopes like towering falcons aim
At objects in an airy height:
The little pleasure of the game
Is from afar to view the flight.

Our anxious pains we all the day
In search of what we like employ;
Scorning at night the worthless prey,
We find the labour gave the joy.

At distance through an artful glass
To the mind's eye things well appear;
They lose their forms, and make a mass
Confused and black, if brought too near.

If we see right we see our woes:
Then what avails it to have eyes?
From ignorance our comfort flows:
The only wretched are the wise.

We weary'd should lie down in death:
This cheat of life would take no more
If you thought fame but empty breath,
I Phillis but a perjured whore. 


YOUR subjects hope, dread Sire--
The crown upon your brows may flourish long,
O may your sceptre num'rous nations sway,
And all with love and readiness obey!
   But how shall we the British king reward!
Rule thou in peace, our father, and our lord!
Midst the remembrance of thy favours past,
The meanest peasants most admire the last*
May George, beloved by all the nations round,
Live with heav'ns choicest constant blessings crown'd!
And from his head let ev'ry evil fly!
And may each clime with equal gladness see
A monarch's smile can set his subjects free!

 


WHAT is there in the universal Earth
More lovely than a Wreath from the bay tree?
Haply a Halo round the Moon a glee
Circling from three sweet pair of Lips in Mirth;
And haply you will say the dewy birth
Of morning Roses ripplings tenderly
Spread by the Halcyon's breast upon the Sea
But these Comparisons are nothing worth
Then is there nothing in the world so fair?
The silvery tears of April? Youth of May? 
Or June that breathes out life for butterflies?
No none of these can from my favourite bear
Away the Palm yet shall it ever pay
Due Reverence to your most sovereign eyes. 


Why, Madam, will ye longer weep,
Whenas your baby's lull'd asleep?
And, pretty child, feels now no more
Those pains it lately felt before.

All now is silent; groans are fled;
Your child lies still, yet is not dead,
But rather like a flower hid here,
To spring again another year. 

Here reading how fond Adam was betray'd,
And how by sin Eve's blasted charms decay'd,
Our common loss unjustly you complain,
So small that part of it which you sustain.

You still, fair mother, in your offspring trace
The stock of beauty destined for the race;
Kind Nature forming them, the pattern took
From heaven's first work, and Eve's original look.

You, happy saint, the serpent's power control;
Scarce any actual guilt defiles your soul;
And hell does o'er that mind vain triumphs boast
Which gains does o'er that mind vain triumphs boast

With virtue strong as yours had Eve been arm'd,
In vain the fruit had blush'd, or serpent charm'd;
Nor had our bliss by penitence been bought,
Nor had frail Adam fall'n, nor Milton wrote. 


to the light
we aim ourselves
away from darkness
we swear

but i guess 
not too much light
in the same manner
that i do not 
have so much of 
this darkness

to both
we shall be blinded
let us settle
midway

to dusk let us toast
this drink
of gray


I.
Thy country's curse is on thee, darkest crest
Of that foul, knotted, many-headed worm
Which rends our Mother’s bosom—Priestly Pest!
Masked Resurrection of a buried Form!

II.
Thy country's curse is on thee! Justice sold,
Truth trampled, Nature’s landmarks overthrown,
And heaps of fraud-accumulated gold,
Plead, loud as thunder, at Destruction's throne.

III.
And whilst that sure slow Angel which aye stands
Watching the beck of Mutability 
Delays to execute her high commands,
And, though a nation weeps, spares thine and thee,

IV.
Oh, let a father's curse be on thy soul,
And let a daughter's hope be on thy tomb;
Be both, on thy gray head, a leaden cowl
To weigh thee down to thine approaching doom.

V.
I curse thee by a parent's outraged love,
By hopes long cherished and too lately lost,
By gentle feelings thou couldst never prove,
By griefs which thy stern nature never crossed;

VI.
By those infantine smiles of happy light,
Which were a fire within a stranger's hearth,
Quenched even when kindled, in untimely night
Hiding the promise of a lovely birth:

VII.
By those unpractised accents of young speech,
Which he who is a father thought to frame
To gentlest lore, such as the wisest teach--
THOU strike the lyre of mind!--oh, grief and shame!

VIII.
By all the happy see in children's growth--
That undeveloped flower of budding years--
Sweetness and sadness interwoven both,
Source of the sweetest hopes and saddest fears--

IX.
By all the days, under an hireling's care,
Of dull constraint and bitter heaviness,--
O wretched ye if ever any were,--
Sadder than orphans, yet not fatherless!

X.
By the false cant which on their innocent lips
Must hang like poison on an opening bloom,
By the dark creeds which cover with eclipse
Their pathway from the cradle to the tomb--

XI.
By thy most impious Hell, and all its terror;
By all the grief, the madness, and the guilt
Of thine impostures, which must be their error--
That sand on which thy crumbling power is built--

XII.
By thy complicity with lust and hate--
Thy thirst for tears—thy hunger after gold--
The ready frauds which ever on thee wait--
The servile arts in which thou hast grown old--

XIII.
By thy most killing sneer, and by thy smile--
By all the arts and snares of thy black den,
And—for thou canst outweep the crocodile--
By thy false tears—those millstones braining men--

XIV.
By all the hate which checks a father's love--
By all the scorn which kills a fathe's care--
By those most impious hands which dared remove
Nature’s high bounds--by thee--and by despair--

XV.
Yes, the despair which bids a father groan,
And cry, 'My children are no longer mine--
The blood within those veins may be mine own,
But--Tyrant--their polluted souls are thine;— XVI.
I curse thee--though I hate thee not.--O slave!
If thou couldst quench the earth-consuming Hell
Of which thou art a daemon, on thy grave
This curse should be a blessing. Fare thee well


Come, sit we under yonder tree,
Where merry as the maids we'll be;
And as on primroses we sit,
We'll venture, if we can, at wit;
If not, at draw-gloves we will play,
So spend some minutes of the day;
Or else spin out the thread of sands,
Playing at questions and commands:
Or tell what strange tricks Love can do,
By quickly making one of two.
Thus we will sit and talk, but tell
No cruel truths of Philomel,
Or Phillis, whom hard fate forced on
To kill herself for Demophon;
But fables we'll relate; how Jove
Put on all shapes to get a Love;
As now a satyr, then a swan,
A bull but then, and now a man.
Next, we will act how young men woo,
And sigh and kiss as lovers do;
And talk of brides; and who shall make
That wedding-smock, this bridal-cake,
That dress, this sprig, that leaf, this vine,
That smooth and silken columbine.
This done, we'll draw lots who shall buy
And gild the bays and rosemary;
What posies for our wedding rings;
What gloves we'll give, and ribbonings;
And smiling at our selves, decree
Who then the joining priest shall be;
What short sweet prayers shall be said,
And how the posset shall be made
With cream of lilies, not of kine,
And maiden's-blush for spiced wine.
Thus having talk'd, we'll next commend
A kiss to each, and so we'll end. 


Now leave the check-reins slack,
The seed is flying far today -
The seed like stars against the black
Eternity of April clay.


This seed is potent as the seed
Of knowledge in the Hebrew Book,
So drive your horses in the creed

Forget the men on Brady's Hill.
Forget what Brady's boy may say.
For destiny will not fulfil
Unless you let the harrow play.

Forget the worm's opinion too
Of hooves and pointed harrow-pins,
For you are driving your horses through
The mist where Genesis begins. 

The day returns again, my natal day;
What mix'd emotions with the Thought arise!
Beloved friend, four years have pass'd away
Since thou wert snatch'd forever from our eyes.


The day, commemorative of my birth
Bestowing Life and Light and Hope on me,
Brings back the hour which was thy last on Earth.
Oh! bitter pang of torturing Memory!-- 

Angelic Woman! past my power to praise
In Language meet, thy Talents, Temper, mind.
Thy solid Worth, they captivating Grace!--
Thou friend and ornament of Humankind!-- 

At Johnson's death by Hamilton t'was said,
'Seek we a substitute--Ah! vain the plan,
No second best remains to Johnson dead--
None can remind us even of the Man.' 

So we of thee--unequall'd in thy race
Unequall'd thou, as he the first of Men.
Vainly we wearch around the vacant place,
We ne'er may look upon thy like again. 

Come then fond Fancy, thou indulgant Power,--
--Hope is desponding, chill, severe to thee!--
Bless thou, this little portion of an hour,
Let me behold her as she used to be. 

I see her here, with all her smiles benign,
Her looks of eager Love, her accents sweet.
That voice and Countenance almost divine!--
Expression, Harmony, alike complete.-- 

I listen--'tis not sound alone--'tis sense,
'Tis Genius, Taste and Tenderness of Soul.
'Tis genuine warmth of heart without pretence
And purity of Mind that crowns the whole. 

She speaks; 'tis Eloquence--that grace of Tongue
So rare, so lovely!--Never misapplied
By her to palliate Vice, or deck a Wrong,
She speaks and reasons but on Virtue's side. 

Her's is the Engergy of Soul sincere.
Seeks but to comfort, heal, enlighten, chear,
Confer a pleasure, or prevent a pain.-- 

Can ought enhance such Goodness?--Yes, to me,
Her partial favour from my earliest years
Consummates all.--Ah! Give me yet to see
Her smile of Love.--the Vision diappears. 

'Tis past and gone--We meet no more below.
Short is the Cheat of Fancy o'er the Tomb.
Oh! might I hope to equal Bliss to go!
To meet thee Angel! in thy future home!-- 

Fain would I feel an union in thy fate,
Fain would I seek to draw an Omen fair
From this connection in our Earthly date.
Indulge the harmless weakness --
Reason, spare.


By duty bound, and not by custome led
To celebrate the praises of the dead,
My mournfull mind, sore prest, in trembling verse
Presents my Lamentations at his Herse,
Who was my Father, Guide, Instructer too,
To whom I ought whatever I could doe:
Nor is't Relation near my hand shall tye;
For who more cause to boast his worth then I?
Who heard or saw, observ'd or knew him better?
Or who alive then I, a greater debtor?
Let malice bite, and envy knaw its fill,
He was my Father, and Ile praise him still.
Nor was his name, or life lead so obscure
That pitty might some Trumpeters procure.
Who after death might make him falsly seem
Such as in life, no man could justly deem.
Well known and lov'd, where ere he liv'd, by most
Both in his native, and in foreign coast,
These to the world his merits could make known,
So needs no Testimonial from his own;
But now or never I must pay my Sum;
While others tell his worth, I'le not be dumb:
One of thy Founders, him New-England know,
Who staid thy feeble sides when thou wast low,
Who spent his state, his strength, & years with care
That After-comers in them might have share.
True Patriot of this little Commonweal,
Who is't can tax thee ought, but for thy zeal?
Truths friend thou wert, to errors still a foe,
Which caus'd Apostates to maligne so.
Thy love to true Religion e're shall shine,
Upon the earth he did not build his nest,
But as a Pilgrim, what he had, possest.
High thoughts he gave no harbour in his heart,
Nor honours pufft him up, when he had part:
Those titles loath'd, which some too much do love
For truly his ambition lay above.
His humble mind so lov'd humility,
He left it to his race for Legacy:
And oft and oft, with speeches mild and wise,
Gave his in charge, that Jewel rich to prize.
No ostentation seen in all his wayes,
As in the mean ones, of our foolish dayes,
Which all they have, and more still set to view,
Their greatness may be judg'd by what they shew.
His thoughts were more sublime, his actions wise,
Such vanityes he justly did despise.
Nor wonder 'twas, low things ne'r much did move
For he a Mansion had, prepar'd above,
For which he sigh'd and pray'd & long'd full sore
He might be cloath'd upon, for evermore.
Oft spake of death, and with a smiling chear,
He did exult his end was drawing near,
Now fully ripe, as shock of wheat that's grown,
Death as a Sickle hath him timely mown,
And in celestial Barn hath hous'd him high,
Where storms, nor showrs, nor ought can damnifie.
His Generation serv'd, his labours cease;
And to his Fathers gathered is in peace.
Ah happy Soul, 'mongst Saints and Angels blest,
VVho after all his toyle, is now at rest:
His hoary head in righteousness was found:
As joy in heaven on earth let praise resound.
Forgotten never be his memory,
His blessing rest on his posterity:
His pious Footsteps followed by his race,
At last will bring us to that happy place
Where we with joy each others face shall see,
And parted more by death shall never be.
His Epitaph.
Within this Tomb a Patriot lyes
That was both pious, just and wise,
To Truth a shield, to right a Wall,
To Sectaryes a whip and Maul,
A Magazine of History,
A Prizer of good Company
In manners pleasant and severe
The Good him lov'd, the bad did fear,
And when his time with years was spent
If some rejoyc'd, more did lament. 

And live I still to see Relations gone,
And yet survive to sound this wailing tone;
Ah, woe is me, to write thy Funeral Song,
Who might in reason yet have lived long,
I saw the branches lopt the Tree now fall,
I stood so nigh, it crusht me down withal;
My bruised heart lies sobbing at the Root,
That thou dear Son hath lost both Tree and fruit:
Thou then on Seas sailing to forreign Coast;
Was ignorant what riches thou hadst lost.
But ah too soon those heavy tydings fly,
To strike thee with amazing misery;
Oh how I simpathize with thy sad heart,
And in thy griefs still bear a second part:
I lost a daughter dear, but thou a wife,
Who lov'd thee more (it seem'd) then her own life.
Thou being gone, she longer could not be,
Because her Soul she'd sent along with thee.
One week she only past in pain and woe,
And then her sorrows all at once did go;
A Babe she left before, she soar'd above,
The fifth and last pledg of her dying love,
E're nature would, it hither did arrive,
No wonder it no longer did survive.
So with her Children four, she's now a rest,
All freed from grief (I trust) among the blest;
She one hath left, a joy to thee and me,
The Heavens vouchsafe she may so ever be.
Chear up, (dear Son) thy fainting bleeding heart,
In him alone, that caused all this smart;
What though thy strokes full sad & grievous be,
He knows it is the best for thee and me. 


CALVERT! it must not be unheard by them
Who may respect my name, that I to thee
Owed many years of early liberty.
This care was thine when sickness did condemn
Thy youth to hopeless wasting, root and stem--
That I, if frugal and severe, might stray
Where'er I liked; and finally array
My temples with the Muse's diadem.
Hence, if in freedom I have loved the truth;
If there be aught of pure, or good, or great, 
In my past verse; or shall be, in the lays
Of higher mood, which now I meditate;--
It gladdens me, O worthy, short-lived, Youth!
To think how much of this will be thy praise.


Men of England, wherefore plough
For the lords who lay ye low?
Wherefore weave with toil and care
The rich robes your tyrants wear?

Wherefore feed and clothe and save,
From the cradle to the grave,
Those ungrateful drones who would
Drain your sweat -- nay, drink your blood?

Wherefore, Bees of England, forge
Many a weapon, chain, and scourge,
That these stingless drones may spoil
The forced produce of your toil?

Have ye leisure, comfort, calm,
Shelter, food, love's gentle balm?
Or what is it ye buy so dear
With your pain and with your fear?

The seed ye sow another reaps;
The wealth ye find another keeps;
The robes ye weave another wears;
The arms ye forge another bears.

Sow seed, -- but let no tyrant reap;
Find wealth, -- let no imposter heap;
Weave robes, -- let not the idle wear;
Forge arms, in your defence to bear.

Shrink to your cellars, holes, and cells;
In halls ye deck another dwells.
Why shake the chains ye wrought? Ye see
The steel ye tempered glance on ye.

With plough and spade and hoe and loom,
Trace your grave, and build your tomb,
And weave your winding-sheet, till fair
England be your sepulchre


OCTOBER VANGUARD of Liberty, ye men of Kent,
Ye children of a Soil that doth advance
Her haughty brow against the coast of France,
Now is the time to prove your hardiment!
To France be words of invitation sent!
They from their fields can see the countenance
Of your fierce war, may ken the glittering lance
And hear you shouting forth your brave intent.
Left single, in bold parley, ye, of yore,
Did from the Norman win a gallant wreath; 
Confirmed the charters that were yours before;--
No parleying now! In Britain is one breath;
We all are with you now from shore to shore:--
Ye men of Kent, 'tis victory or death

Thou living light that in thy rainbow hues
Clothest this naked world; and over Sea
And Earth and air, and all the shapes that be
In peopled darkness of this wondrous world
The Spirit of thy glory dost diffuse 
.  truth
thou Vital Flame
Mysterious thought that in this mortal frame
Of things, with unextinguished lustre burnest
Now pale and faint now high to Heaven upcurled
That eer as thou dost languish still returnest
And ever
Before the
before the Pyramids


So soon as from the Earth formless and rude
One living step had chased drear Solitude
Thou wert, Thought; thy brightness charmed the lids
Of the vast snake Eternity, who kept
The tree of good and evil.--Art thou pale for weariness
Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,
Wandering companionless
Among the stars that have a different birth, - 
And ever changing, like a joyless eye
That finds no object worth its constancy


I.
Moonbeam, leave the shadowy vale,
To bathe this burning brow.
Moonbeam, why art thou so pale,
As thou walkest o'er the dewy dale,
Where humble wild-flowers grow? 
Is it to mimic me?
But that can never be;
For thine orb is bright,
And the clouds are light,
That at intervals shadow the star-studded night.

II.
Now all is deathy still on earth;
Nature’s tired frame reposes;
And, ere the golden morning’s birth
Its radiant hues discloses,
Flies forth its balmy breath. 
But mine is the midnight of Death,
And Nature's morn
To my bosom forlorn
Brings but a gloomier night, implants a deadlier thorn.

III.
Wretch! Suppress the glare of madness
Struggling in thine haggard eye,
For the keenest throb of sadness,
Pale Despair's most sickening sigh,
Is but to mimic me;
And this must ever be,
When the twilight of care,
And the night of despair,
Seem in my breast but joys to the pangs that rankle there. 


To the most beautiful girl that I've known
Whose unconventional charms are so sweet
And whose laugh is the highlight of my day
How I wish I could sweep you off your feet

To the most beautiful girl that I've known
Whose smile brightens my day and warms my heart
And whose energy encapsulates me
Oh, how I miss you when we are apart

To the most beautiful girl that I've known
Who, though I have not known for long at all
Has, somehow made my heart so fond of hers
How very magically I am enthralled

To the most beautiful girl that I've known
I wish I could assemble the right words
To tell you the feelings I have for you
But, dear, if I told you, would it be heard? 

To the most beautiful girl that I've known
I am trying to be a better man
For you deserve only the best
Being the best, for you, is in my plans

To the most beautiful girl that I've known
You may never know how I feel for you
I wish I had the courage to tell you
That I've been waiting for a girl like you



We have been mentally tortured, we have been torched
By the incredibly heinous acts of this sick and convoluted villain.
We are sad, uncomfortable, crushed beyond belief; we are in pain.
It is not right; too many angels have been cowardly executed.
Too many good people with glorious dreams and aspirations
Have been annihilated. This time, we want our officials to take actions, 
To make serious decisions regarding gun control. We are flabbergasted, 
We are sick in our stomach. Too many deaths, too many funerals, 
Too many tears, too much hurts, too much suffering, too much sadness.
The world is not the same anymore, this is a nightmarish madness.
We need healing, we are very sad every time a leaf falls, 
Every time we hear the cries of a child from dawn to sunset.
We are beyond ourselves, we are not happy, we are very upset.
Our world is upside down. We are praying that the Almighty help us
To move on, and to protect us in the future against every conceivable force.
We are deeply wounded, we yearn to live better days under the sun.


Whether on Ida's shady brow, 
         Or in the chambers of the East,
     The chambers of the sun, that now
         From ancient melody have ceas'd;

     Whether in Heav'n ye wander fair,
         Or the green corners of the earth,
     Or the blue regions of the air,
         Where the melodious winds have birth;

     Whether on crystal rocks ye rove,
       Beneath the bosom of the sea
   Wand'ring in many a coral grove,
       Fair Nine, forsaking Poetry!

   How have you left the ancient love
      That bards of old enjoy'd in you!
   The languid strings do scarcely move!
       The sound is forc'd, the notes are few




O Time's titanic offspring come to earth, 
A marvel is your own stupendous womb
Wherefrom a thousand sons shall take their birth
To raise, on Hade's immigrants here a tomb? 

Send to rid, through your children's aid, the world
Of all the countless apples of discord -
By Satan being relentlessly hurled? 

May your first-born be a War-exporter, 
Exporting War to Hell by fastest planes! 
May the next one be a Peace-importer, 
Importing Peace from Heaven by dove-trains! 
  This wondrous ware could be our magic wand
  To exorcise all evils from our land. 




If Life be a Sea and your are a Wave, 
O kind New Year, will you not save
Us from sinking, by letting us ride
Atop your apex, taming the tide? 

If Life be a Book and a Page you are, 
O neat New Year, let us not mar
With blots and blotches, your fresh fair face, 
Nor waste, with blanks, you scanty space.

If Life be a Play and you are a Scene, 
Help us enact some roles that are clean, 
O noble New Year, during your term.
Be fair sans favour, forgiving but firm.

If Life be a Travel and a Train you be, 
O New Year dear, please hear my plea: 
Carry us not, through rancid routes, 
To stalls that sell forbidden fruits.

If Life be a Game and you are a Ball, 
O smart New Year, fail not to fall
In goals like Health, courage, compassion; 
Avoid such goals as pelf and passion.
I
f Life be a Prayer and you are His proxy
Bringing us alms, O New Year, mercy! 
Place some crumbs of Peace in our bowls
To feed our hungry hearts and souls. 


With what stillness at last
you appear in the valley
your first sunlight reaching down
to touch the tips of a few
high leaves that do not stir
as though they had not noticed
and did not know you at all
then the voice of a dove calls
from far away in itself
to the hush of the morning

so this is the sound of you
here and now whether or not
anyone hears it this is
where we have come with our age
our knowledge such as it is
and our hopes such as they are
invisible before us
untouched and still possible


Tender caresses of kind little sisters
Are ready for you.
With the birds' songs, O the charmed prince,
We're waiting for you.
Branch drunk with sun, you grew, visage of heaven
Before my eyes.
Like a girl tender, like a child quiet,
All - surprise.
They'll often say: 'These sisters are treacherous
In each reply!'
Cocky with daring ones, kids with a boy, timid
With someone shy.
We love, like you, melting clouds and birches
And melted snow.
We love the tales about grandmother's daughters,
Little and slow!
Pitiful is the wind, spring remembering,
Gems in the skies..
We wait for you, one that knows nothing of life,
And has blue eyes


Son of the old Moon-mountains African!
Chief of the Pyramid and Crocodile!
We call thee fruitful, and that very while
A desert fills our seeing's inward span:
Nurse of swart nations since the world began,
Art thou so fruitful? or dost thou beguile
Such men to honour thee, who, worn with toil,
Rest for a space 'twixt Cairo and Decan?
O may dark fancies err! They surely do;
'Tis ignorance that makes a barren waste
Of all beyond itself. Thou dost bedew
Green rushes like our rivers, and dost taste
The pleasant sunrise. Green isles hast thou too,
And to the sea as happily dost haste. 


How shall I know, unless I go
To Cairo and Cathay,
Whether or not this blessed spot
Is blest in every way?

Now it may be, the flower for me
Is this beneath my nose:
How shall I tell, unless I smell
The Carthaginian rose?

The fabric of my faithful love
No power shall dim or ravel
Whilst I stay here,—but oh, my dear,
If I should ever travel


One scene away from the river Atrai
In past, present and future
You, the old palm tree
tell me: 

Why water is the main title of
Our grief? 

Why birds come to you for shelter? 
Why they leave you alone and
Fly away towards unknown


To the one I love, the one I adore, 
My only goal in life, the one I live for -
Though we might fight more than we get along, 
I hope our relationship will never go wrong.
I love to be with you, I love you around; 
I'm so glad I'm the one you found.
Though you may not see what you mean to me, 
My love for you will always be.
I know you love me and I know you care; 
That's why I treasure the love we share.
I want you to know I'm here for you, 
Whatever it is I'll help you through.
To the one I love, the one I adore, 
My love grows every day more and more. 


Sister and mother and diviner love,
And of the sisterhood of the living dead
Most near, most clear, and of the clearest bloom,
And of the fragrant mothers the most dear
And flame and summer and sweet fire, no thread
Of cloudy silver sprinkles in your gown
Its venom of renown, and on your head
No crown is simpler than the simple hair. 

Now, of the music summoned by the birth
That separates us from the wind and sea,
Yet leaves us in them, until earth becomes,
By being so much of the things we are,
Gross effigy and simulacrum, none
Gives motion to perfection more serene
Than yours, out of our own imperfections wrought,
Most rare, or ever of more kindred air
In the laborious weaving that you wear. 

For so retentive of themselves are men
That music is intensest which proclaims
The near, the clear, and vaunts the clearest bloom,
And of all the vigils musing the obscure,
That apprehends the most which sees and names,
As in your name, an image that is sure,
Among the arrant spices of the sun,
O bough and bush and scented vine, in whom
We give ourselves our likest issuance. 

Yet not too like, yet not so like to be
Too near, too clear, saving a little to endow
Our feigning with the strange unlike, whence springs
The difference that heavenly pity brings.
For this, musician, in your girdle fixed
Bear other perfumes. On your pale head wear
A band entwining, set with fatal stones.
Unreal, give back to us what once you gave:
The imagination that we spurned and crave.


do I baffle you, do I make you despair?
I, Americus, the American,
wrought from the dark in my mother long ago,
from the dark of ancient Europa--
Why are you staring at me now
in the dusk of our civilization--
Why are you staring at me
as if I were America itself
the new Empire
vaster than any in ancient days
with its electronic highways
carrying its corporate monoculture
around the world
And English the Latin of our days--


Great Oracle, sleeping through the centuries, 
Awaken now at last
And tell us how to save us from ourselves
and how to survive our own rulers 
who would make a plutocracy of our democracy 
in the Great Divide
between the rich and the poor
in whom Walt Whitman heard America singing

O long-silent Sybil, 
you of the winged dreams, 
Speak out from your temple of light 
as the serious constellations 
with Greek names
still stare down on us 
as a lighthouse moves its megaphone 
over the sea
Speak out and shine upon us 
the sea-light of Greece 
the diamond light of Greece

Far-seeing Sybil, forever hidden, 
Come out of your cave at last 
And speak to us in the poet's voice 
the voice of the fourth person singular 
the voice of the inscrutable future 
the voice of the people mixed
with a wild soft laughter--
And give us new dreams to dream, 
Give us new myths to live by


Dear dark-brown waters full of all the stain 
  Of sombre spruce-woods and the forest fens,
  Laden with sound from far-off northern glens
  Where winds and craggy cataracts complain,
  Voices of streams and mountain pines astrain,
  The pines that brood above the roaring foam
  Of La Montagne or Les Erables; thine home
  Is distant yet, a shleter far to gain.
  Aye still to eastward, past the shadowy lake
  And the long slopes of Rigaud toward the sun,
  The mightier stream, thy comrade, waits for thee,
  The beryl waters that espouse and take
  Thine in thei deep embrace, and bear thee on
  In that great bridal journey to the sea. 


You strop my anger, especially
when I find you in restaurant or bar
and pay for the same liquid, coming and going.
In bus depots and airports and turnpike plazas
some woman is dragging in with three kids hung off her
shrieking their simple urgency like gulls.
She's supposed to pay for each of them
and the privilege of not dirtying the corporate floor.
Sometimes a woman in a uniform's on duty
black or whatever the prevailing bottom is
getting thirty cents an hour to make sure
no woman sneaks her full bladder under a door.
Most blatantly you shout that waste of resources
for the greatest good of the smallest number
where twenty pay toilets line up glinty clean
and at the end of the row one free toilet
oozes from under its crooked door,
while a row of weary women carrying packages and babies
wait and wait and wait to do
what only the dead find unnecessary. 


The blank parchment is wordlessly taunting me
Shall I write out a Will? Or a Plea? 
The troops of Santa Anna surround us, 
Should I surrender unconditionally? 
No! I've replied with the cannon! 
I'm determined to here make my Stand.
My life and my honor for Texas, 
My beloved adopted homeland.
Their red flag of no quarter is flying.
So far I have not lost a man.
Ceaseless is their cannonading, 
"Victory or Death! "- My command. 


BARD of the Fleece, whose skilful genius made
That work a living landscape fair and bright;
Nor hallowed less with musical delight
Than those soft scenes through which thy childhood strayed,
Those southern tracts of Cambria, 'deep embayed,
With green hills fenced, with ocean's murmur lulled;'
Though hasty Fame hath many a chaplet culled
For worthless brows, while in the pensive shade
Of cold neglect she leaves thy head ungraced,
Yet pure and powerful minds, hearts meek and still, 
A grateful few, shall love thy modest Lay,
Long as the shepherd's bleating flock shall stray
O'er naked Snowdon's wide aerial waste;
Long as the thrush shall pipe on Grongar Hill

and also you are in store for many more
i can't hardly wait to see what's next

yes, you out there that write

with words 
just as i do too


What are these bustlers at the gate
Of now or yesterday,
These playthings in the hand of Fate,
That pass, and point no way;

These clinging bubbles whose mock fires
For ever dance and gleam,
Vain foam that gathers and expires
Upon the world's dark stream;

These gropers betwixt right and wrong,
That seek an unknown goal,
Most ignorant, when they seem most strong;
What are they, then, O Soul,

That thou shouldst covet overmuch
A tenderer range of heart,
And yet at every dreamed-of touch
So tremulously start?

Thou with that hatred ever new
Of the world's base control,
That vision of the large and true,
That quickness of the soul;

Nay, for they are not of thy kind,
But in a rarer clay
Thou canst not be as they.

Be strong therefore; resume thy load,
And forward stone by stone
Go singing, though the glorious road
Thou travellest alone. 


O loyal to the royal in thyself, 
And loyal to thy land, as this to thee-- 
Bear witness, that rememberable day, 
When, pale as yet, and fever-worn, the Prince 
Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again 
From halfway down the shadow of the grave, 
Past with thee through thy people and their love, 
And London rolled one tide of joy through all 
Her trebled millions, and loud leagues of man 
And welcome! witness, too, the silent cry, 
The prayer of many a race and creed, and clime-- 
Thunderless lightnings striking under sea 
From sunset and sunrise of all thy realm, 
And that true North, whereof we lately heard 
A strain to shame us 'keep you to yourselves; 
So loyal is too costly! friends--your love 
Is but a burthen:  loose the bond, and go.' 
Is this the tone of empire? here the faith 
That made us rulers? this, indeed, her voice 
And meaning, whom the roar of Hougoumont 
Left mightiest of all peoples under heaven? 
What shock has fooled her since, that she should speak 
So feebly? wealthier--wealthier--hour by hour! 
The voice of Britain, or a sinking land, 
Some third-rate isle half-lost among her seas? 
THERE rang her voice, when the full city pealed 
Thee and thy Prince!  The loyal to their crown 
Are loyal to their own far sons, who love 
Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes 
For ever-broadening England, and her throne 
In our vast Orient, and one isle, one isle, 
That knows not her own greatness:  if she knows 
Not for itself, but through thy living love 
For one to whom I made it o'er his grave 
Sacred, accept this old imperfect tale, 
New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul, 
Ideal manhood closed in real man, 
Rather than that gray king, whose name, a ghost, 
Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak, 
And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him 
Of Geoffrey's book, or him of Malleor's, one 
Touched by the adulterous finger of a time 
That hovered between war and wantonness, 
And crownings and dethronements:  take withal 
Thy poet's blessing, and his trust that Heaven 
Will blow the tempest in the distance back 
From thine and ours:  for some are sacred, who mark, 
Or wisely or unwisely, signs of storm, 
Waverings of every vane with every wind, 
And wordy trucklings to the transient hour, 
And fierce or careless looseners of the faith, 
And Softness breeding scorn of simple life, 
Or Cowardice, the child of lust for gold, 
Or Labour, with a groan and not a voice, 
Or Art with poisonous honey stolen from France, 
And that which knows, but careful for itself, 
And that which knows not, ruling that which knows 
To its own harm:  the goal of this great world 
Lies beyond sight:  yet--if our slowly-grown 
And crowned Republic's crowning common-sense, 
That saved her many times, not fail--their fears 
Are morning shadows huger than the shapes 
That cast them, not those gloomier which forego 
The darkness of that battle in the West, 
Where all of high and holy dies away. 


Princess, descended from that noble race
Which still in danger held the imperial throne,
Who human nature and thy sex dost grace,
Whose virtues even thy foes are forced to own.
 
The generous French, as fierce as they're polite,
Who to true glory constantly aspire;
Whilst obstinately they against thee fight,
Thy virtue and great qualities admire.
 
The French and Germans leagued by wondrous ties,
And from their friendship greater ills arise,
Than e'er did from their longest quarrels flow.
 
Thus from the equator and the frozen pole,
The impetuous winds drive on with headlong force
Two clouds, which as they on each other roll,
Forth from their sable skirts the thunder force.
 
Do virtuous kings such ruin then ordain?
A calm they promise, but excite a storm:
Felicity we hope for from their reign,
Whilst they with slaughter dire the earth deform.
 
Oh! Fleury, wise and venerable sage,
Whom good ne'er dazzles, danger ne'er alarms;
Who dost exceed the ancient Nestor's age:
Must Europe never cease to be in arms?
 
Would thou couldst hold with prudent, steady hand,
Europa's balance, shut up Janus' shrine;
Make feuds and discords cease at thy command,
And bring from heaven Astrea, maid divine.
 
Would France's treasures were dispersed no more,
But prudently within the realm applied;
Opulence to our cities to restore,
And make them flourishing on every side.
 
You arts from heaven, and from the muses sprung,
Whom Louis brought triumphant into France;
Too long your hands are idle, lyres unstrung,
'Tis time to start from so profound a trance.
 
Your labors are of lasting glory sure,
Whilst warlike pomps, the triumphs of a day,
Blaze for a moment, never long endure,
But soon like fleeting shadows pass away. 


As you read, a white bear leisurely
pees, dyeing the snow
saffron,

and as you read, many gods
lie among lianas: eyes of obsidian
are watching the generations of leaves,

and as you read
the sea is turning its dark pages,
turning
its dark pages. 


TO cultivate in ev'ry noble mind
Habitual grace, and sentiments refin'd,
Thus while you strive to mend the human heart,
Thus while the heav'nly precepts you impart,
O may each bosom catch the sacred fire,
And youthful minds to Virtue's throne aspire!
And Virtue shines in all her native light,
In vain would Vice her works in night conceal,
For Wisdom's eye pervades the sable veil.
  Artists may paint the sun's effulgent rays,
While his great works in Amory's pages shine,
And while he proves his essence all divine,
The Atheist sure no more can boast aloud
As if the clay without the potter's aid
Should rise in various forms, and shapes self-made,
Or worlds above with orb o'er orb profound
Self-mov'd could run the everlasting round.
It cannot be--unerring Wisdom guides
With eye propitious, and o'er all presides.
  Still prosper, Amory! still may'st thou receive
The warmest blessings which a muse can give,
And when this transitory state is o'er,
When kingdoms fall, and fleeting Fame's no more,
May Amory triumph in immortal fame,
A nobler title, and superior name


HAIL, happy day, when, smiling like the morn,
Fair Freedom rose New-England to adorn:
The northern clime beneath her genial ray,
Dartmouth, congratulates thy blissful sway:
Elate with hope her race no longer mourns,
Each soul expands, each grateful bosom burns,
While in thine hand with pleasure we behold
The silken reins, and Freedom's charms unfold.
Long lost to realms beneath the northern skies
She shines supreme, while hated faction dies:
Sick at the view, she languish'd and expir'd;
Thus from the splendors of the morning light
The owl in sadness seeks the caves of night.
  No more, America, in mournful strain
Of wrongs, and grievance unredress'd complain,
No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain,
Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand
Had made, and with it meant t' enslave the land.
  Should you, my lord, while you peruse my song,
Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung,
Whence flow these wishes for the common good,
By feeling hearts alone best understood,
I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate
Was snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy seat:
What pangs excruciating must molest,
What sorrows labour in my parent's breast?
Steel'd was that soul and by no misery mov'd
That from a father seiz'd his babe belov'd:
Such, such my case.  And can I then but pray
Others may never feel tyrannic sway?
  For favours past, great Sir, our thanks are due,
And thee we ask thy favours to renew,
Since in thy pow'r, as in thy will before,
To sooth the griefs, which thou did'st once deplore.
May heav'nly grace the sacred sanction give
To all thy works, and thou for ever live
Not only on the wings of fleeting Fame,
Though praise immortal crowns the patriot's name,
But to conduct to heav'ns refulgent fane,
May fiery coursers sweep th' ethereal plain,
And bear thee upwards to that blest abode


Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
        Of crystal, wandering water,
      Thou art an emblem of the glow
          Of beauty- the unhidden heart-
          The playful maziness of art
      In old Alberto's daughter;

      But when within thy wave she looks-
        Which glistens then, and trembles-
      Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
        Her worshipper resembles;
      For in his heart, as in thy stream,
        Her image deeply lies-
      His heart which trembles at the beam
        Of her soul-searching eyes. 


Old garden of grayish and ochre lichen,
How long a rime since the brown people who have vanished from
here
Built fires beside you and nestled by you
Out of the ranging sea-wind? A hundred years, two hundred,
You have been dissevered from humanity
And only known the stubble squirrels and the headland rabbits,
Or the long-fetlocked plowhorses
Breaking the hilltop in December, sea-gulls following,
Screaming in the black furrow; no one
Touched you with love, the gray hawk and the red hawk touched
you
Where now my hand lies. So I have brought you
Wine and white milk and honey for the hundred years of famine
And the hundred cold ages of sea-wind.

I did not dream the taste of wine could bind with granite,
Nor honey and milk please you; but sweetly
They mingle down the storm-worn cracks among the mosses,
Interpenetrating the silent
Wing-prints of ancient weathers long at peace, and the older
Scars of primal fire, and the stone
Endurance that is waiting millions of years to carry
A corner of the house, this also destined.
Lend me the stone strength of the past and I will lend you
The wings of the future, for I have them.
How dear you will be to me when I too grow old, old comrade. 


Go, happy Rose, and interwove
With other flowers, bind my Love.
Tell her, too, she must not be
Longer flowing, longer free,
That so oft has fetter'd me.

Say, if she's fretful, I have bands
Of pearl and gold, to bind her hands;
Tell her, if she struggle still,
I have myrtle rods at will,
For to tame, though not to kill.

Take thou my blessing thus, and go
And tell her this,--but do not so!--
Lest a handsome anger fly
Like a lightning from her eye,
And burn thee up, as well as I


ENOUGH of climbing toil!--Ambition treads
Here, as 'mid busier scenes, ground steep and rough,
Or slippery even to peril! and each step,
As we for most uncertain recompence
Mount toward the empire of the fickle clouds,
Each weary step, dwarfing the world below,
Induces, for its old familiar sights,
Unacceptable feelings of contempt,
With wonder mixed--that Man could e'er be tied,
In anxious bondage, to such nice array 
And formal fellowship of petty things!
--Oh! 'tis the 'heart' that magnifies this life,
Making a truth and beauty of her own;
And moss-grown alleys, circumscribing shades,
And gurgling rills, assist her in the work
More efficaciously than realms outspread,
As in a map, before the adventurer's gaze--
Ocean and Earth contending for regard.
The umbrageous woods are left--how far beneath!
But lo! where darkness seems to guard the mouth 
Of yon wild cave, whose jagged brows are fringed
With flaccid threads of ivy, in the still
And sultry air, depending motionless.
Yet cool the space within, and not uncheered
(As whoso enters shall ere long perceive)
By stealthy influx of the timid day
Mingling with night, such twilight to compose
As Numa loved; when, in the Egerian grot,
From the sage Nymph appearing at his wish,
He gained whate'er a regal mind might ask, 
Or need, of counsel breathed through lips divine.
Long as the heat shall rage, let that dim cave
Protect us, there deciphering as we may
Diluvian records; or the sighs of Earth
Interpreting; or counting for old Time
His minutes, by reiterated drops,
Audible tears, from some invisible source
That deepens upon fancy--more and more
Drawn toward the centre whence those sighs creep forth
To awe the lightness of humanity: 
Or, shutting up thyself within thyself,
There let me see thee sink into a mood
Of gentler thought, protracted till thine eye
Be calm as water when the winds are gone,
And no one can tell whither. Dearest Friend!
We two have known such happy hours together
That, were power granted to replace them (fetched
From out the pensive shadows where they lie)
In the first warmth of their original sunshine,
Loth should I be to use it: passing sweet 
Are the domains of tender memory


TO THE SLEEPLESS BELLS
(TO THE POET CHUMMED UP
WITH A VERSEZ. )          


The melody – the element of poetry-
A song to the poet
Chummed up with a verse-
That all the dreams
Flower at night
Poets knows better 
Than anyone else-

They know that the dull notes
Of all the broken hearts
Can’t humble the treasured rhyme, 
The rhyme they can’t lower-

They know that inspiration
And the nine heavenly gates
Brighten up the rhythm, 
And make it flower-

The same with the major, 
With the sacred remoteness, 
The everlasting life, 
Or the first word, 
The honored word 
Uttered in time-

The song to the poet
Chummed up with a verse, 
Who was taken ill, 
And by the verse was healed-

The sleepless bells
Rang in the chapel-
And I prayed to the 



PANSIES, lilies, kingcups, daisies,
Let them live upon their praises;
Long as there's a sun that sets,
Primroses will have their glory;
Long as there are violets,
They will have a place in story:
There's a flower that shall be mine,
'Tis the little Celandine.

Eyes of some men travel far
For the finding of a star; 
Up and down the heavens they go,
Men that keep a mighty rout!
I'm as great as they, I trow,
Since the day I found thee out,
Little Flower!--I'll make a stir,
Like a sage astronomer.

Modest, yet withal an Elf
Bold, and lavish of thyself;
Since we needs must first have met
I have seen thee, high and low, 
Thirty years or more, and yet
'Twas a face I did not know;
Thou hast now, go where I may,
Fifty greetings in a day.

Ere a leaf is on a bush,
In the time before the thrush
Has a thought about her nest,
Thou wilt come with half a call,
Spreading out thy glossy breast
Like a careless Prodigal; 
Telling tales about the sun,
When we've little warmth, or none.

Poets, vain men in their mood!
Travel with the multitude:
Never heed them; I aver
That they all are wanton wooers;
But the thrifty cottager,
Who stirs little out of doors,
Joys to spy thee near her home;
Spring is coming, Thou art come! 

Comfort have thou of thy merit,
Kindly, unassuming Spirit!
Careless of thy neighbourhood,
Thou dost show thy pleasant face
On the moor, and in the wood,
In the lane;--there's not a place,
Howsoever mean it be,
But 'tis good enough for thee.

Ill befall the yellow flowers,
Children of the flaring hours! 
Buttercups, that will be seen,
Whether we will see or no;
Others, too, of lofty mien;
They have done as worldlings do,
Taken praise that should be thine,
Little, humble Celandine!

Prophet of delight and mirth,
Ill-requited upon earth;
Herald of a mighty band,
Of a joyous train ensuing, 
Serving at my heart's command,
Tasks that are no tasks renewing,
I will sing, as doth behove,
Hymns in praise of what I love



Green Snake, when I hung you round my neck
and stroked your cold, pulsing throat
as you hissed to me, glinting
arrowy gold scales, and I felt
the weight of you on my shoulders,
and the whispering silver of your dryness
sounded close at my ears --

Green Snake--I swore to my companions that certainly
you were harmless! But truly
I had no certainty, and no hope, only desiring
to hold you, for that joy, 
which left
a long wake of pleasure, as the leaves moved
and you faded into the pattern
of grass and shadows, and I returned
smiling and haunted, to a dark morning. 



COMPOSED WHILE WE WERE LABOURING TOGETHER IN HIS PLEASURE-GROUND

SPADE! with which Wilkinson hath tilled his lands,
And shaped these pleasant walks by Emont's side,
Thou art a tool of honour in my hands;
I press thee, through the yielding soil, with pride.


Rare master has it been thy lot to know;
Long hast Thou served a man to reason true;
Whose life combines the best of high and low,
The labouring many and the resting few;

Health, meekness, ardour, quietness secure,
And industry of body and of mind; 
And elegant enjoyments, that are pure
As nature is; too pure to be refined.

Here often hast Thou heard the Poet sing
In concord with his river murmuring by;
Or in some silent field, while timid spring
Is yet uncheered by other minstrelsy.

Who shall inherit Thee when death has laid
Low in the darksome cell thine own dear lord?
That man will have a trophy, humble Spade!
A trophy nobler than a conqueror's sword. 

If he be one that feels, with skill to part
False praise from true, or, greater from the less,
Thee will he welcome to his hand and heart,
Thou monument of peaceful happiness!

He will not dread with Thee a toilsome day--
Thee his loved servant, his inspiring mate!
And, when thou art past service, worn away,
No dull oblivious nook shall hide thy fate.

His thrift thy uselessness will never scorn;
An 'heir-loom' in his cottage wilt thou be:-- 
High will he hang thee up, well pleased to adorn
His rustic chimney with the last of Thee


Stone-cutters fighting time with marble, you foredefeated
Challengers of oblivion
Eat cynical earnings, knowing rock splits, records fall down,
The square-limbed Roman letters
Scale in the thaws, wear in the rain. The poet as well
Builds his monument mockingly;
For man will be blotted out, the blithe earth die, the brave sun
Die blind and blacken to the heart:
Yet stones have stood for a thousand years, and pained thoughts found
The honey of peace in old poems. 


Good evening, Sir Priest, and so late as you ride,
With your mule so fair, and your mantle so wide; 
But ride you through valley, or ride you o'er hill. 
There is one that has warrant to wait on you still. 
Back, back, 
The volume black! 
I have a warrant to carry it back.

What, ho! Sub-Prior, and came you but here 
To conjure a book from a dead woman's bier? 
Sain you, and save you, be wary and wise, 
Ride back with the book, or you'll pay for your prize. 
Back, back. 
There's death in the track! 
In the name of my master I bid thee bear back.

'In the name of MY Master,' said the astonished monk, 'that name before which all things created tremble, I conjure thee to say what thou art that hauntest me thus?' 
The same voice replied,- 

That which is neither ill nor well,
That which belongs not to Heaven nor to hell, 
A wreath of the mist, a bubble of the stream, 
'Twixt a waking thought and a sleeping dream; 
A form that men spy 
With the half-shut eye. 
In the beams of the setting sun, am I.

Vainly, Sir Prior, wouldst thou bar me my right! 
Like the star when it shoots, I can dart through the night; 
I can dance on the torrent and ride on the air, 
And travel the world with the bonny night-mare. 
Again, again, 
At the crook of the glen, 
Where bickers the burnie, I'll meet thee again.


Men of good are bold as sackless
Men of rude are wild and reckless, 
Lie thou still 
In the nook of the hill. 
For those be before thee that wish thee ill. 


THE prayers I make will then be sweet indeed
If Thou the spirit give by which I pray:
My unassisted heart is barren clay,
That of its native self can nothing feed:
Of good and pious works thou art the seed,
That quickens only where thou say'st it may:
Unless Thou show to us thine own true way
No man can find it: Father! Thou must lead.
Do Thou, then, breathe those thoughts into my mind
By which such virtue may in me be bred 
That in thy holy footsteps I may tread;
The fetters of my tongue do Thou unbind,
That I may have the power to sing of thee,
And sound thy praises everlastingly. 

Come with rain. O loud Southwester! 
Bring the singer, bring the nester; 
Give the buried flower a dream; 
Make the settled snowbank steam; 
Find the brown beneath the white; 
But whate'er you do tonight, 
Bath my window, make it flow, 
Melt it as the ice will go; 
Melt the glass and leave the sticks 
Like a hermit's crucifix; 
Burst into my narrow stall; 
Swing the picture on the wall; 
Run the rattling pages o'er; 
Scatter poems on the floor; 
Turn the poet out of door. 


O' man thou erecteth palaces, castles and courts
while on death a mere grave sufficeth thee
How magnificent and formidable thou maketh thy forts
in thy wish to make both future and history.

Thou who art' accustomed to marble walls
and mansions of mirror, silver and gold
Thy grave shalt be small compared to palatial halls
even if a thousand demons it may hold.

Not a coin or even  half a coin of gold 
wilt thou take with thee to thy grave
All that shalt ye leave behind for others to behold
and now shalt ye fear though ere thou hath been brave.


Thy innards shalt merge with mere earth soil and sand
No matter now if ye dwelled in huts or palaces of gold
Thy grave shalt occupy the tiniest portion of thy land
From the warmth of quilted beds wilt thee lie in the cold.
Thus ere ye consider founding, building thy imposing edifice
a homeless vagrant if ye shelter in thine care
Knowing our lives art' but on a mere precipice
while the joy of giving doth give a joy beyond compare! 


Death's a journey but no provisions can ye take along and fold
How are ye to respond when it inevitably calls? 
A simple ditch our skeletal bones shalt hold
as the living walk all over us with gentle footfalls.

Shakespeare too returned to dust as hath saith he
and while many might abandon his archaic style
yet his quill shalt vie for soul-like immortality
for his works might flow on as does the old Nile. 


Gather ye rose-buds while ye may:
Old Time is still a-flying; 
And this same flower that smiles to-day,
To-morrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the Sun,
The higher he's a-getting,
The sooner will his race be run,
And nearer he's to setting.


That age is best, which is the first,
When youth and blood are warmer; 
But being spent, the worse, and worst
Times, still succeed the former.

- Then be not coy, but use your time,
And while ye may, go marry; 
For having lost but once your prime,
You may for ever tarry. 

Reach with your whiter hands to me
Some crystal of the spring;
And I about the cup shall see
Fresh lilies flourishing.

Or else, sweet nymphs, do you but this--
To th' glass your lips incline;
And I shall see by that one kiss
The water turn'd to wine. 

SWEET western wind, whose luck it is, 
   Made rival with the air, 
To give Perenna's lip a kiss, 
   And fan her wanton hair: 

Bring me but one, I'll promise thee, 
   Instead of common showers, 
Thy wings shall be embalm'd by me, 
   And all beset with flowers. 


some say we should keep personal remorse from the 
poem,
stay abstract, and there is some reason in this,
but jezus;
twelve poems gone and I don't keep carbons and you have
my
paintings too, my best ones; its stifling:
are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?
why didn't you take my money? they usually do
from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.
next time take my left arm or a fifty
I'm not Shakespeare
but sometime simply
there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise; 
there'll always be mony and whores and drunkards
down to the last bomb,
crossing his legs,
I see where I have made plenty of poets
but not so very much
poetry. 


Thou art to all lost love the best,
The only true plant found,
Wherewith young men and maids distrest
And left of love, are crown'd.

When once the lover's rose is dead
Or laid aside forlorn,
Then willow-garlands, 'bout the head,
Bedew'd with tears, are worn.

When with neglect, the lover's bane,
Poor maids rewarded be,
For their love lost their only gain
Is but a wreath from thee.

And underneath thy cooling shade,
When weary of the light,
The love-spent youth, and love-sick maid,
Come to weep out the night. 


Some fragments of her heart
That was shattered long ago
Swam to the winter burrow
With broken angelic wings

Some sailed a forlorn vessel
Of desires, of wants and needs
A complex obsession that lies
Thumping on adobe of fantasy

Some swirled mutely on brooks
Of veracity’s enchanting tale
Bitter sweet on daylight’s arm
Yet warm on silver moon’s charm


O stay, sweet warbling wood-lark, stay,
Nor quit for me the trembling spray,
A hapless lover courts thy lay,
     Thy soothing fond complaining.

Again, again that tender part,
That I may catch thy melting art,
For surely that wad touch her heart,
     Wha kills me wi' disdaining.

Say, was thy little mate unkind,
And heard thee as the careless wind?
Oh, nocht but lobve and sorrow join'd,

Thou tells o' never-ending care;
O' speechless grief, and dark despair;
For pity's sake, sweet bird, nae mair!
     Or my poor heart is broken


To Thee Thou hast drawn my love, O Fakir! 
I was sleeping in my own chamber, 
and Thou didst awaken me; 
  striking me with Thy voice, O Fakir! 
I was drowning in the deeps of the ocean of this world, and
  Thou didst save me: upholding me with Thine arm, O Fakir! 
Only one word and no second-
and Thou hast made me tear off all
  my bonds, O Fakir! 
Kabîr says, 'Thou hast united Thy heart to my heart, O Fakir! 


'To think of your lover, 
how could there be any other? 
Another soul to stay near you, 
so you won't be blue.

Another heart, 
that would break if you were to part.
How could you leave someone like this? 
With them life is bliss.

To think of your lover, 
is to think of no other.
That one person that holds your hand, 
the one that takes you to a different land.

Someone to have for Valentine's.
Someone you can call 'mine'.
A true heart to stand by you.
Someone only for you. 


I must have seen your face a million times
Since the day you called me and said goodbye
Never imagined I'd still think of you
Yet, still, I awaken to those green eyes

A million times I've thought of you and why
Why you left me all alone in the dark
Jigsaw puzzle of a million pieces
Questions, no answers: How'd I miss the mark? 

Once in my life, I felt I had it all
You by my side I could conquer the world
Now with you gone away, all my strength fades
‘Fraid of the storms, to the corner I curl

I should be so happy you found a man
Who cares for you as I once cared, so true
He's the kind of guy you always wanted
He's a guy that's truly worthy of you

But, I am left here all alone, sweetheart
And, to this day, I don't know what to do



You arrived; 
The end is way afar yet.
And you have already relinquished; 
All your days of juvenile hopes, 
And all your nights of wet dreams.


Strippers, Dancers and Hookers, 
Crying, 
While awake or asleep; 
Money, Money and Money-
Professors, Doctors and Philosophers, 
Whispering, 
In the ears of their confused minds; 
Money, Money and Money-
Priests, Pandits and Sheikhs, 
Praying, 
In the abodes of their delusional holiness; 
Money, Money and Money-
Artists, Poets and Thinkers, 
Talking, 
To an imagery of their animated desires; 
Money, Money and Money-
Revolutionists, Extremists and Politicians, 
Shouting, 
In the minds of the naive adolescence; 
Money, Money and Money-

Hey, 
Why are you saying so? 
Are you out of your mind? 
Are you not one of us? 
Hey, 
We got you; 
You penniless filth, 
You say things about Money; 
When, 
Can’t get it any more-
Before, 
You were like us; 
Crying, whispering, praying, talking and shouting for
Money, Money and Money-


Listen to me; 
My brothers and sisters, 
For I would not speak again.
I, 
Who is one like you; 
Is no different, 
From your own flesh and blood.
Which runs through your veins, 
And which you don’t even mind to eat; 
When ravenous.
Lend me your ears; 
My brothers and sisters, 
For I would not speak again.
Do not misjudge me, 
And do not deny me; 
As I am one of you.
This world is a false metaphor; 
Created millions of years back, 
With the darkness of Light.
An examination venue, 
Designed like a ball room; 
Where men and women, 
Come; make pairs, dance and leave.
But before leaving; 
They are acknowledged with a testimony, 
Of their orgasmic love; 
In the form of the angelic divinity.


Men and Women of our mother earth; 
Here creeps an illusive ambiguity-
If we all were angels once; 
And if we were nothing, 
But a part of eternal divinity-
Then, 
Why we have become devils today? 
Needs, Desires, Beliefs, Hatreds, and underneath all; 
Our Ego-


I am neither a prophet nor a saint, 
I am like you, just an ordinary man; 
I know nothing, 
Except the internal fact; 
And that is what you fear to listen-
If you can kill your Ego, 
For another man or woman; 
If you can sacrifice your inner-self, 
For the sake of the other soul; 
You can salvage, 
The Spirit Forfeited; 
And you can retrieve, 
The Paradise Lost; 
On this planet of living misery, 
And in this world of dying humanity.



To this World she returned.
But with a tinge of that—
A Compound manner,
As a Sod
Espoused a Violet,
That chiefer to the Skies
Than to himself, allied,
Dwelt hesitating, half of Dust,
And half of Day, the Bride. 




    I have made for you a song
    And it may be right or wrong,
But only you can tell me if it's true.
    I have tried for to explain
    Both your pleasure and your pain,
And, Thomas, here's my best respects to you!

    O there'll surely come a day
    When they'll give you all your pay,
    So, until that day comes round,
    Heaven keep you safe and sound,
And, Thomas, here's my best respects to you


TO my friend Butts I write  
My first vision of light,  
On the yellow sands sitting.  
The sun was emitting  
His glorious beams          
From Heaven’s high streams.  
Over sea, over land,  
My eyes did expand  
Into regions of air,  
Away from all care;         
Into regions of fire,  
Remote from desire;  
The light of the morning  
Heaven’s mountains adorning:  
In particles bright,        
The jewels of light  
Distinct shone and clear.  
Amaz’d and in fear  
I each particle gazed,  
Astonish’d, amazed;         
For each was a Man  
Human-form’d. Swift I ran,  
For they beckon’d to me,  
Remote by the sea,  
Saying: ‘Each grain of sand,         
Every stone on the land,  
Each rock and each hill,  
Each fountain and rill,  
Each herb and each tree,  
Mountain, hill, earth, and sea,         
Cloud, meteor, and star,  
Are men seen afar.’  
I stood in the streams  
Of Heaven’s bright beams,  
And saw Felpham sweet         
Beneath my bright feet,  
In soft Female charms;  
And in her fair arms  
My Shadow I knew,  
And my wife’s Shadow too,         
And my sister, and friend.  
We like infants descend  
In our Shadows on earth,  
Like a weak mortal birth.  
My eyes, more and more,         
Like a sea without shore,  
Continue expanding,  
The Heavens commanding;  
Till the jewels of light,  
Heavenly men beaming bright,         
Appear’d as One Man,  
Who complacent began  
My limbs to enfold  
In His beams of bright gold;  
Like dross purg’d away         
All my mire and my clay.  
Soft consum’d in delight,  
In His bosom sun-bright  
I remain’d. Soft He smil’d,  
And I heard His voice mild,         
Saying: ‘This is My fold,  
O thou ram horn’d with gold,  
Who awakest from sleep  
On the sides of the deep.  
On the mountains around         
The roarings resound  
Of the lion and wolf,  
The loud sea, and deep gulf.  
These are guards of My fold,  
O thou ram horn’d with gold!’         
And the voice faded mild;  
I remain’d as a child;  
All I ever had known  
Before me bright shone:  
I saw you and your wife         
By the fountains of life.  
Such the vision to me  
Appear’d on the sea. 



it was an obstinate hill to climb:
How toilsome--nay, how dire--it was, by thee
Is known; by none, perhaps, so feelingly:
But thou, who, starting in thy fervent prime,
Didst first lead forth that enterprise sublime,
Hast heard the constant Voice its charge repeat,
Which, out of thy young heart's oracular seat,
First roused thee.--O true yoke-fellow of Time,
Duty's intrepid liegeman, see, the palm
Is won, and by all Nations shall be worn! 
The blood-stained Writing is for ever torn;
And thou henceforth wilt have a good man's calm,
A great man's happiness; thy zeal shall find
Repose at length, firm friend of human kind


Cruel of heart, lay down my song,
Your reading eyes have done me wrong,
Not for you was the pen bitten,
And the mind wrung, and the song written. 

Whate'er is Born of Mortal Birth
Must be consumed with the Earth
To rise from Generation free:
Then what have I to do with thee?

The Sexes sprung from Shame & Pride,
Blow'd in the morn, in evening died;
But Mercy chang'd Death into Sleep;
The Sexes rose to work & weep.

Thou, Mother of my Mortal part,
With cruelty didst mould my Heart,
And with false self-deceiving tears
Didst bind my Nostrils, Eyes, & Ears:

Didst close my Tongue in senseless clay,
And me to Mortal Life betray.
Then what have I to do with thee


The skies they were ashen and sober;
          The leaves they were crisped and sere-
          The leaves they were withering and sere;
      It was night in the lonesome October
          Of my most immemorial year;
      It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
          In the misty mid region of Weir-
      It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
          In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

      Here once, through an alley Titanic,
          Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul-
          Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
      There were days when my heart was volcanic
          As the scoriac rivers that roll-
          As the lavas that restlessly roll
      Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
          In the ultimate climes of the pole-
      That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
          In the realms of the boreal pole.

      Our talk had been serious and sober,
          But our thoughts they were palsied and sere-
          Our memories were treacherous and sere-
      For we knew not the month was October,
          And we marked not the night of the year-
          (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
      We noted not the dim lake of Auber-
          (Though once we had journeyed down here),
      Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
          Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

      And now, as the night was senescent,
          And star-dials pointed to morn-
          As the star-dials hinted of morn-
      At the end of our path a liquescent
          And nebulous lustre was born,
      Out of which a miraculous crescent
          Arose with a duplicate horn-
      Astarte's bediamonded crescent
          Distinct with its duplicate horn.

      And I said- 'She is warmer than Dian:
          She rolls through an ether of sighs-
          She revels in a region of sighs:
      She has seen that the tears are not dry on
          These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
      And has come past the stars of the Lion,
          To point us the path to the skies-
          To the Lethean peace of the skies-
      Come up, in despite of the Lion,
          To shine on us with her bright eyes-
      Come up through the lair of the Lion,
          With love in her luminous eyes.'

      But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
          Said- 'Sadly this star I mistrust-
          Her pallor I strangely mistrust:-
      Oh, hasten!- oh, let us not linger!
          Oh, fly!- let us fly!- for we must.'
      In terror she spoke, letting sink her
          Wings until they trailed in the dust-
      In agony sobbed, letting sink her
          Plumes till they trailed in the dust-
          Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

      I replied- 'This is nothing but dreaming:
          Let us on by this tremulous light!
          Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
      Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
          With Hope and in Beauty to-night:-
          See!- it flickers up the sky through the night!
      Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
          And be sure it will lead us aright-
      We safely may trust to a gleaming
          That cannot but guide us aright,
          Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.'

      Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
          And tempted her out of her gloom-
          And conquered her scruples and gloom;
      And we passed to the end of the vista,
          But were stopped by the door of a tomb-
          By the door of a legended tomb;
      And I said- 'What is written, sweet sister,
          On the door of this legended tomb?'
          She replied- 'Ulalume- Ulalume-
          'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!'

      Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
          As the leaves that were crisped and sere-
          As the leaves that were withering and sere-
      And I cried- 'It was surely October
          On this very night of last year
          That I journeyed- I journeyed down here-
          That I brought a dread burden down here-
          On this night of all nights in the year,
          Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
      Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber-
          This misty mid region of Weir-
      Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,
          This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.


          'To venerate the simple days
Which lead the seasons by,
Needs but to remember
That from you or I,
They may take the trifle
Termed mortality


Return to greet me, colours that were my joy, 
Not in the woeful crimson of men slain, 
But shining as a garden; come with the streaming 
Banners of dawn and sundown after rain. 

I want to fill my gaze with blue and silver, 
Radiance through living roses, spires of green 
Rising in young-limbed copse and lovely wood, 
Where the hueless wind passes and cries unseen. 

I am not sad; only I long for lustre, -- 
Tired of the greys and browns and the leafless ash. 
I would have hours that move like a glitter of dancers 
Far from the angry guns that boom and flash. 

Return, musical, gay with blossom and fleetness, 
Days when my sight shall be clear and my heart rejoice; 
Come from the sea with breadth of approaching brightness, 
When the blithe wind laughs on the hills with uplifted voice. 


Welcome, maids of honour,
You do bring
In the Spring;
And wait upon her.

She has virgins many,
Fresh and fair;
Yet you are
More sweet than any.

You're the maiden posies;
And so graced,
To be placed
'Fore damask roses.

--Yet, though thus respected,
By and by
Ye do lie,
Poor girls, neglected. 




Roman Virgil, thou that singest
Ilion's lofty temples robed in fire,
Ilion falling, Rome arising,
wars, and filial faith, and Dido's pyre;

Landscape-lover, lord of language
more than he that sang the Works and Days,
All the chosen coin of fancy
flashing out from many a golden phrase;

Thou that singest wheat and woodland,
tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd;
All the charm of all the Muses
often flowering in a lonely word;

Poet of the happy Tityrus
piping underneath his beechen bowers;
Poet of the poet-satyr
whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers;

Chanter of the Pollio, glorying
in the blissful years again to be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow,
unlaborious earth and oarless sea;

Thou that seest Universal
Nature moved by Universal Mind;
Thou majestic in thy sadness
at the doubtful doom of human kind;

Light among the vanished ages;
star that gildest yet this phantom shore;
Golden branch amid the shadows,
kings and realms that pass to rise no more;

Now thy Forum roars no longer,
fallen every purple Caesar's dome - 
Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm
sound for ever of Imperial Rome - 

Now the Rome of slaves hath perished,
and the Rome of freemen holds her place,
I, from out the Northern Island
sundered once from all the human race,

I salute thee, Mantovano,
I that loved thee since my day began,
Wielder of the stateliest measure
ever moulded by the lips of man. 



I 
Calm was the sea to which your course you kept, 
Oh, how much calmer than all southern seas! 
Many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze 
Wafted from mothers that of old have wept. 
All souls of children taken as they slept 
Are your companions, partners of your ease, 
And the green souls of all these autumn trees 
Are with you through the silent spaces swept. 
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath 
Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve, 
But that we merit not your holy death? 
We shall not loiter long, your friends and I; 
Living you made it goodlier to live, 
Dead you will make it easier to die. 

II 

With you a part of me hath passed away; 
For in the peopled forest of my mind 
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind 
Shall never don again its green array. 
Chapel and fireside, country road and bay, 
Have something of their friendliness resigned; 
Another, if I would, I could not find, 
And I am grown much older in a day. 
But yet I treasure in my memory 
Your gift of charity, your mellow ease, 
And the dear honour of your amity; 
For these once mine, my life is rich with these. 
And I scarce know which part may greater be,— 
What I keep of you, or you rob of me. 

III 

Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight 
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail; 
Your docile spirit, winged by this gale, 
Hath at the dawning fled into the light. 
And I half know why heaven deemed it right 
Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail; 
Eternity hath borrowed that delight. 
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run 
Where all the great things live that lived of yore, 
And in eternal quiet float and soar; 
There all my loves are gathered into one, 
Where change is not, nor parting any more, 
Nor revolution of the moon and sun. 

IV 

In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung 
To toll your passing, had you not been dead; 
For time a sadder mask than death may spread 
Over the face that ever should be young. 
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung 
Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head 
Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed 
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung. 
And though the after world will never hear 
The happy name of one so gently true, 
Nor chronicles write large this fatal year, 
Yet we who loved you, though we be but few, 
Keep you in whatsoe’er is good, and rear 
In our weak virtues monuments to you.


To wait an Hour—is long—
If Love be just beyond—
To wait Eternity—is short—
If Love reward the end—

To want, 
with every fibre, every breath.
to want, 
every thought all consuming, 
every wish unfulfilled.
to want
to let it become greater then you, 
lose your sense, your self, your soul.
to want
this is what you have done to me. 


To what serves mortal beauty ' —dangerous; does set danc- 
ing blood—the O-seal-that-so ' feature, flung prouder form 
Than Purcell tune lets tread to? ' See: it does this: keeps warm 
Men’s wits to the things that are; ' what good means—where a glance
Master more may than gaze, ' gaze out of countenance.
Those lovely lads once, wet-fresh ' windfalls of war’s storm, 
How then should Gregory, a father, ' have gleaned else from swarm-
To man, that needs would worship ' block or barren stone, 
Our law says: Love what are ' love’s worthiest, were all known;
World’s loveliest—men’s selves. Self ' flashes off frame and face. 
What do then? how meet beauty? ' Merely meet it; own, 
Home at heart, heaven’s sweet gift; ' then leave, let that alone. 


TO what shall I compare her,
That is as fair as she?
For she is fairer - fairer
Than the sea.
What shall be likened to her,
The sainted of my youth?
For she is truer - truer
Than the truth.

As the stars are from the sleeper,
Her heart is hid from me;
For she is deeper - deeper
Than the sea.
Yet in my dreams I view her
Flush rosy with new ruth -
Dreams!  Ah, may these prove truer
Than the truth. 

In Autumn,
as in Spring,
the sap flows,
the sap wishes to race
against heartbeats
before the winter,
before the winter
buries us
in her usual shroud of ice.

I turn to you
knowing that
unrequited love
is good
for poetry,
knowing that pain
will nudge the muse
as well as anything,
knowing that you
are afraid, fettered
to a life
you do not love,
& so unfree
that freedom seems
more fearful even
than the familiar
business
of being
a grumbling slave.



I lived
that way
once,
& I know
that freedom
is its own reward,
that it propagates
itself
by means
of runners,

that nobody
gives it to you,
not even me
to you,

but that you
must seize it
with your own
two quaking hands
& pluck
the strawberry
it bears
in the green
ungrumbling

Spring. 



Watch 
The purple clouds 
Dance together
In the midnight blue skies
And wonder
Whose holding 
The paintbrush 


Is Aphrodite sullen
Or Athena thoughtful
Is Aries planning war
Or Hephaestus forging 
Just dreaming

Could it be a nightmare 
My existence
Sure seems to be
A million 
Pardons and apologies
For being a plague
That can write

See your Little Brother
That cherub boy
Taunts me so
And will not let
Me go

Not to Tartarus
Or Elysium 
Where all souls go
Though my place
I do not know

Could you speak to him
On my behalf
I’ve begged your mother
And simply
Heard her laugh

Tyranny and dictatorship
Your patrons
Only seem to know
But with time
My age begins 
To show

The cycles of the moon
Haven’t affected you
But I grow old
And like the roses
In your garden
I do wilt
In the snow

A misconception
From so long ago
I am only mortal
I do not posses
Your glow

Nor your heart
Or thoughts
So tell that little creature
To ready his bow
And change 
The arrow

If I am to die alone
Then so be it
I’ll go
With so many things
Unknown


And maybe it’s for the best
For what good is there
In loving gold
When fate
Only feeds your heart
Stone

Take no offense
This oversight
Was not your own
But one
A mythology 
In the making



Both arrows
Couldn’t have been gold
Such
Would have been a travesty
An oddity and miscalculation
Of epic proportions
We are
Apollo and Daphne 
Yet
I do not shine

The next chance you get
Please
Equip that cherub demon
And correct the error
Of his ways
Let me go
In peace
Or pieces
Which ever
Works best


You won’t shed a tear
Nor even draw a breath
When the marksman
Has hit his target
And I have left



I’ve seen you do it
Plenty of times
One more won’t hurt
Only me
Like those two days in June
When I would’ve stayed
Had you asked me to

But the question
Died on your lips
Before it ever 
Entered your mind
Now I beg of you
One more time

Toss it away
Burn it if you must
Four years
There was never
Any lust

Simply an emotion
I can’t control
Until my neural pathways
Disappear 
Like I wish I could

I no long dream
In color
Just black and white wishes
Of things
That could have been

I do not ask 
For salvation
Now a drastic change
Let’s simply follow our routine
But this spring
Don’t revive me


Let be death be sweet
Let that much mercy
I’ve never known
Be sweet
And should your heartbeat
Come find me

But till then
Break this hold
Over me
Don’t breathe
Your seed ever eternal
Into me 
Till the winds change
Along with the tide

I will forever be Pygmalion
After Galatea ran away
With the prince of her dreams
Miserable Amphitrite 
Once your siren call
Is gone

Just let him know
This mortal
Can withstand it

No more


Careless whispers, heartless talk
Where are you going with this? 
"Daddy was not a man for me, mother was everything"
Ignorance breeds ugly talk
Mothers beware of crazy sounds bites
Of crazy gossip at the dinner table when daddy was gone
Sow not evil in the hearts of these young ones

Listen to her: 
"Happy father’s day to all the great fathers out there 
And to all the mothers who had to pick up the slack
From the not so great fathers -
Yes, so that means happy father’s day to my mother"

Daddy had his problems, we all know that
Daddy was daddy, taking you day care, changing your diaper
At your graduation, daddy was there
At the center of so much love was daddy
Yes daddy had his problems
But now mother says daddy was crazy 
And daughter thinks father was a loser

"Daddy was a slacker, mother was everything"
Hearts drinking from a poisoned chalice
Gullible minds, stamped with resentment
Daughter talk in gossip conversation
Did not mother tell you the truth? 
That daddy had his problems, but daddy will always love you
And daddy will never abandon you

Be careful daughter as you go on into the world
Think not of the world as without a man worthy of your praise or admiration
Or that you can take on the world by yourself - 
Deep in the heart of every family is love
See the world with clear motives for survival
And realize that we weren’t born bad, neither were you or your mother
But most importantly, that daddy will always be here for you


Youth now flees on feathered foot
Faint and fainter sounds the flute,
Rarer songs of gods; and still
Somewhere on the sunny hill,
Or along the winding stream,
Through the willows, flits a dream;
Flits but shows a smiling face,
Flees but with so quaint a grace,
None can choose to stay at home,
All must follow, all must roam.


This is unborn beauty: she
Now in air floats high and free,
Takes the sun and breaks the blue;--
Late with stooping pinion flew

Raking hedgerow trees, and wet
Her wing in silver streams, and set
Shining foot on temple roof:
Now again she flies aloof,
Coasting mountain clouds and kiss't
By the evening's amethyst.

In wet wood and miry lane,
Still we pant and pound in vain;
Still with leaden foot we chase
Waning pinion, fainting face;
Still with gray hair we stumble on,
Till, behold, the vision gone!
Where hath fleeting beauty led?
To the doorway of the dead.
Life is over, life was gay:
We have come the primrose way. 


If two may read aright 
These rhymes of old delight 
And house and garden play, 
You too, my cousins, and you only, may. 

You in a garden green 
Were hunter, soldier, tar, 
And all the thousand things that children are. 

Now in the elders' seat 
We rest with quiet feet, 
And from the window-bay 
We watch the children, our successors, play. 

"Time was," the golden head 
Irrevocably said; 
But time which one can bind, 
While flowing fast away, leaves love behind. 


O Winter! bar thine adamantine doors:
The north is thine; there hast thou built thy dark
Deep-founded habitation. Shake not thy roofs,
Nor bend thy pillars with thine iron car.'
He hears me not, but o'er the yawning deep
Rides heavy; his storms are unchain'd, sheathed
In ribbed steel; I dare not lift mine eyes,
For he hath rear'd his sceptre o'er the world.

Lo! now the direful monster, whose skin clings
To his strong bones, strides o'er the groaning rocks:
He withers all in silence, and in his hand
Unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life.

He takes his seat upon the cliffs,--the mariner
Cries in vain. Poor little wretch, that deal'st
With storms!--till heaven smiles, and the monster
Is driv'n yelling to his caves beneath mount Hecla. 


Thou grim physician, armed with septic shears, 
Thou that dissemblest even in death's repose 
Earth's quiet pulse and her remedial throes, 
How dull thy visage on this day appears! 
Let now the dismal heaven give vent, its tears 
Come frozen ever; no gale coeval blows 
Filled with the ravaged perfume of the rose; 
And keep not all fair things forsaken biers? 
O haste, then, spiritless minister, thy pains 
To charge the sources of the unfruitful earth 
For harvests blest in wood, in plot and lawn! 
O laggard, on! till fire re-flood the veins 
Of Spring here, ay, to trip the vales with Mirth, 
As, long night over, does the exulting dawn


The good and the bad
An angel’s fight against the devil’s work
When and how, where to whom
No one knows behind the blinking doom

Good ones have compassionate heart
Thoughtful and gentle, sharing all what he has
From that weakness of, pictures a fragile persona 
The devil’s mind grin to test kindred’s antenna

In different ways, in different stage
Storms will come into the cape of faith
In adversities call, howling winds rage
Turmoil swirl, tears flow to the brave

From the devil’s work, we stumble and fall
Dine on his plate, marking our teeth from mistakes
Tartar molds - bacteria swarming to our veins
Thus, we need a brush to clean and pat our self


We need cleanser, utensils 
To wipe off those germs that eat our existence



I asked my heart to say
Some word whose worth my love's devoir might pay
      Upon my Lady's natal day.

      Then said my heart to me:
`Learn from the rhyme that now shall come to thee
      What fits thy Love most lovingly.'

      This gift that learning shows;
For, as a rhyme unto its rhyme-twin goes,
      I send a rose unto a Rose. 


I hear you will not fall in love with me
because I come without a guarantee,
because someday I may depart at whim
and leave you desolate, abandoned, grim.
If that's the case, what use to be alive?
In loving life you love what can't survive:
and if you grow too fond and lose your head,
it's all for nought-for someday you'll be dead.
Maintain a cool detachment through the years.
Wear blinders, dear, put cotton in your ears.
Since worms will taste the tongue that tastes the wine,
burst not the grape against your palate fine.
With care, your puny heart will still be whole
the day they come to fetch your tepid soul.
And as that strumpet, Life, deals her last blow,
you'll have this final consolatio:
you'll snap your flippant fingers as you fall,
and say, 'I never cared for her at all!


'When the world spins 'round
With it's rushed pace and little time
It is always nice to sit and know
I am yours and you are mine
Sometimes I get caught up
In what the world would have me do
But, with a simple smile or glance
My heart, again, is true to you
I've found what's important
Through all of the rest
It is to find the one you'll love
And learn to love them the best
There is so much I've already learned
It is your heart I'm longing for
And for your heart I'll yearn
You've taken my life from nothing
And built it into a dream come true
And for that I owe you everything
My heart, my dreams, to you



That will solve a murder case unsolved for years
Because the murderer left it in the snow beside a window
Through which he saw her head, connecting with
Her shoulders by a neck, and laid a red
Roof in her heart. For this we live a thousand years;
For this we love, and we live because we love, we are not
Inside a bottle, thank goodness! I love you as a
Kid searches for a goat; I am crazier than shirttails
In the wind, when you’re near, a wind that blows from
The big blue sea, so shiny so deep and so unlike us;
I think I am bicycling across an Africa of green and white fields
Always, to be near you, even in my heart
When I’m awake, which swims, and also I believe that you
Are trustworthy as the sidewalk which leads me to
The place where I again think of you, a new
Harmony of thoughts! I love you as the sunlight leads the prow
Of a ship which sails
From Hartford to Miami, and I love you
Best at dawn, when even before I am awake the sun
Receives me in the questions which you always pose.


Again returns the day.
On this occasion, 
Few words wanna to say.
Be happy this day, 
And days to come.
Keep smiling always, 
With pure fun.
Like the flow of a stream, 
Taking all pebbles to hole
Meets the sea as its goal.
To overcome any bar
And achive what's your aim, 
By all means and in time.
Without pain and depression not a bit.
Now, wishing you a happy birth day.
Be happy Brother!  sincerely I pray. 


That afternoon the dream of the toads 
rang through the elms by Little River
and affected the thoughts of men, 
though they were not conscious that 
they heard it.



The dream of toads: we rarely 
credit what we consider lesser 
life with emotions big as ours, 
but we are easily distracted, 
abstracted. People sit nibbling 
before television's flicker watching 
ghosts chase balls and each other 
while the skunk is out risking grisly 
death to cross the highway to mate; 
while the fox scales the wire fence 
where it knows the shotgun lurks 
to taste the sweet blood of a hen. 
Birds are greedy little bombs 
bursting to give voice to appetite. 
I had a cat who died of love.
Dogs trail their masters across con-
tinents. We are far too busy 
to be starkly simple in passion. 
We will never dream the intense 
wet spring lust of the toads. 


It was my first experience of hard labour, 
working in the green fields under the sun, 
on a long working holiday in the south.

The farm owner lent me a cottage across the road
from the fields where we started early, finished late
on my first experience of hard labour.

I picked the larger green leaves at ground level first, 
moving along the rows and up the plants to smaller ones
on that long working holiday in the south.

There were tractors and trailers coming round regularly, 
taking bundles of tied-together leaves to the sheds
on my first experience of hard labour.

I met other students and older seasonal workers too.
We went to dances in town on late Saturday nights
on that long holiday job down south.

This was a long time ago; it was positive.
I did not know then the end-product was so negative
on my first experience of hard labour under the sun, 
on that long working holiday in the south.




Hey, Toby, Toby, Toby!—Dead?
The silence is a flood
That closes, choking, overhead,
And chills the living blood.

The leaping friend, whose jolly bark
Was greeting every night,
No more to thrill the summer dark
With welcome of delight?

Beside his grave I bend the knee,
And O, my eyes are dim.
He hunted for the dog in me:
I found the man in him. 


If ever there were a spring day so perfect, so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze


Today 
looking out my window all i see is the dark and gray durning midday
i see the same houses, streets and face as i did back in my younger days

today
ive been thinking back on everthing good and bad in the years that past, 
even with all the good in my life why do i feel the dark and gray 

today
im missing the little things, your simple hi or hey, 
the way your sweet smile would brighting up my day

today
ive been schearching my heart and soul too truly understand, 
the way my life has gone gray

today
im missing yesterday
where there was light, warmth, and you clearly in my sight

today
i preyed, that my yesterdays
where here today


Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas!
   You really are beautiful! Pearls,
   harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! all
   the stuff they've always talked about
 
   still makes a poem a surprise!
   These things are with us every day
   even on beachheads and biers. They
   do have meaning. They're strong as rocks. 


This is To-day, a child in white and blue 
Running to meet me out of Night who stilled 
The ghost of Yester-eve; this is fair Morn 
The mother of To-morrow. And these clouds 
That chase the sunshine over gleaming hills
Are thoughts, delighting in the golden change 
And the ceremony of their drifting state. 


This is To-day. To-morrow might bring death,— 
And Life, the gleeful madrigal of birds, 
Be drowned in glimmer of sleep. To-day I know 
How sweet it is to spend these eyes, and boast 
This bubble of vistaed memory and sense 
Blown by my joy aloft the glittering airs 
Of heavenly peace. Oh take me to yourselves, 
Earth, sky, and spirit! Let me stand within
The circle of your transience, that my voice 
May thrill the lonely silences with song.


I  awoke in a stream of rays, 
laid my Pregnant Survivor’s Manual
on the edge of the rug, 
		gave it a quick tug.
At the other end
I placed my book of Vanished Species, 
then squatted in between, 
		gave myself a hug
and felt just like today.


Today i think it would be fun
to go and get a machine gun
today i think i really will
find some nice targets just to kill
today i'll let my anger rise
and when i shoot look in their eyes
today i think will be the same
i'll just play that computer game. 

Yes, indeed. Today is another day
To move on, to move away
From past troubles, from past problems.
Believe me, most of the time, old flames
Bring the remnants of past disasters.
It is time to bury the old monsters.

A new day is young and beautiful.
Take advantage of the fresh dawn, 
Enjoy the warm rays of the sun, 
Of hope, immediate possibilities, 
And new opportunities.


Yes, indeed. Today is another day.
Let’s move on. The sky is not really gray.
Up there, there is a new horizon.
Life is not static; there is a new season, 
Somewhere under the moon, 
And under the sun, a bright afternoon. 



I celebrate another birthday.
For giving me the strength for the right strife, 
For saving me from a danger, 
For giving me a chance to understand a stranger.
For forgiving all my sins, 
For congratulating with my wins.
Another year of my life has passed.
I hope it won’t be the last.
So, I think it’s early for the summing up, 
Many more times I’ll drink my champagne cup.
All I can attempt to do now is: 
Lightly touch my opinion and feelings
Upon some dealings within my interests.
Yes, I have more of life experience, 
I care about my appearance
.
With greater elaboration and motivation
I chose this or that citation, 
And every new day I accept with an elation.
My inside world is young, 
I sing the songs I’ve sung, 
I love to listen to the new songs.
To the whole world my heart belongs.
I realize the life’s price, 
To live on the Earth is really nice.
One more year of my life has passed, 
Life goes so fast.
But anyway it’s worth living
I’ll try to do my best in all, 
And always to be on the ball.


I decided to be a little lazy today.
I woke up very late this morning, 
I vacuumed, I did some cleaning.
I made my breakfast.
I made a nice omelet very fast.
While eating, I watched a few TV programs, 
For about two hours. I am now a few grams
Heavier, I mean a few pounds heavier.
I was going to the gym to make me stronger, 
But I decided against that activity.
I wanted to be a little lazy, 
To relax, to enjoy the day,  and to chill; 
I did not want to kill
Myself today.
When it is your birthday, 
You should take it easy.
I listened to a few songs of Sinatra, 
A few melodies of Nat King Cole.
I had a tiny glass of vodka.
I kicked, for a short time, my soccer ball.


At my age, I feel  very young; 
I am still happy and strong.
I enjoy life tremendously.
I count my blessings, not my failures.
I cherish my victories and use my shortcomings
As powerful  lessons,  to challenge the adventures
And many great evenings; I am praying for more.
I also thank my friends that I love forever more.
I also pray for my enemies.
Don't kid yourself, you have some too, 
They are invisible, they are cuckoo; 
They are everywhere looking at you.
So far, it has been a wonderful day, 
Even though, the sky is gray, 
And it is intermittently raining; 
However, in my heart,  the sun is shining.
Today is a day to ponder, to relax, 
To enjoy and to ignore the sneaky fox.
I am enjoying my day and please do the same, 
Relax and enjoy the other days as well.
I wish you well, stay away of the deadly well; 
I promise you that I will do the same.
I am waiting to have a magnificent night, 
To listen to more classy melodies, 
To see the sun, in my dream, at midnight; 
Today is my birthday, 
I am really lazy today. 



We are celebrating and thanking
And having a wonderful time
This is, of course, a great day to rhyme
To enjoy an incredible life
Not only with my wife
But with everyone who cares about me
It is a shame that some are unhappy
For some unknown and strange reasons
As you all know, I love all of the seasons
Today is another fantastic birthday
I could not careless about the losers
However, I am sending exotic flowers
To them; they need help; they're crazy
Like any other blessed day, I am very happy
I am fine, content, elated, and truly satisfied
And it is a pleasure to testify
Who gave me words when I'm bored
Who put beautiful rhymes in my mouth
And in tough times tickled me to laugh
Aloud like a very happy man
Who has everything under the Sun





I shall take a blank page and 
draw some lines. 
fluent lines, like the lines 
next to your eyes

I shall draw the rain against 
the window that reflects on 
your cheeks.  making you a 
spotted eagle

I shall draw the shadows cast 
upon your face, of the branches
being shaken by the wind.  making 
you a fierce lion



In the middle I shall put my mouth, 
making a wet imprint where your 
mouth would be.  as things between
you and I should be 

then I shall draw my heart, 
to cover your face, 
your eyes, 
your mouth, 
your spots 
and your fierceness, 

the lines flowing all over you, 
and over this page 
which is no longer 
empty but full of the story of 
you, 
and me. 




Everywhere there is green
Layer after layer
Today is the day of his appearance

All the world is overwhelmed with
Joy and a heavenly melody

Today is the day of his rebirth
The rebirth of an angel





This is certainly worse than Saturday.

But- It’s much better than Monday! 

And- It’s much worse than Friday! 

But-Thursday is still better than Wednesday! 

Thursday is even better than Sunday! 

Do you know why? 

What I say is not a lie.

After Sunday always comes Monday.

Hard day, far from being a holiday.

But- after Thursday always comes Friday! 

So, let’s say "Hurray" for today! 

Hurray for this Thursday! 

 

moving 

on a coil spinning in spins
only 

for our life moving in time
that does not last

today is yesterday tomorrow, 
we borrow from the past

never accruing an account that
we can spend 

all of our time has been spent
as it accrues

we are, have no doubt, here 
today

but tomorrow it was yesterday passing
past time spent



we are always in the past 
moving

Forgetting all my care
Soaking the night's air
As I sit in the gentle breeze
It almost brings me to my knees.
I look and I listen at creation galore.
When I think of the different types of love, 
It moves me to help create a solution.
What will happen in ten years or more, 
If we pass off the problems or simply ignore? 
The happiness we had today will turn into sorrow, 
So pitch in and help for a better tomorrow. 

Today’s great undead poets, 
awash in the Internet sea, 
seek to fill the void of sensible emptiness
of our cyberspace world.
Following the heroic tradition of Man, 
these daring individuals look to gain acceptance
through the expression of concepts.
Mirroring the virility and vitality of Life, 
in defiance of critical naysayers, 
the blankness of virtual paper
is scribbled upon with hurt, hope and ideals.
Writing styles and topics, 
whether expressed in romanticized language
or the coarseness of profanity, 
are brilliantly reflected in individualized glory
and authors bask in the personal satisfaction of achievement.
In the ever continuing flow of poetic thought, 
today’s great undead poets
find treasures in the discovery of self. 


Perhaps today's the day that I break free
Free from the hustle that comes each day
Free from distractions that lead me astray
Perhaps I can be what I'm made to be

Perhaps today's the day I'll choose to move
Move beyond the past into tomorrow
Move with purpose in the way I should go
Perhaps I'll believe I've nothing to prove

Perhaps today's the day I'll find my peace
Peace like a stream flowing fresh to my soul
Peace that brings new meaning and makes me whole
Perhaps that assurance will never cease

Perhaps today's the day I'll hear Your voice
So clearly that my heart will have no choice

If today's the day I'm finally free
May I be free to run and tell the world
With Your banner of love proudly unfurled
For today's the day You have set me free

If today's the day I finally move
May I move boldly toward holy life
Allowing You to guide me through the strife
As I dance for joy for You've made me move

And, if today's the day I find Your peace
May I promote that peace to all I meet
Living in peace and loving those I greet
As I gratefully give others Your peace

If today's the day I will hear Your voice
May I know it and may my heart rejoice



that in the last days of this world, 
and treat him as a crime.

and diminish their spirit, 
give their hopes to money, greed and power, 
choosing fleeting fame, grind their souls to dust.

Following religion as if it is a fashion, 
making face appearance at the church
filling up the coffers, 

I read somewhere that sea shall take the shore, 
everyone dip their toes in the waters of
envy, greed, sloth, wrath, gluttony, pride and lust, 
look around you today, need I say more. 


today is the yesterday 
of tomorrow
today is also the tomorrow
of yesterday

yesterday was the today
of the then tomorrow

tomorrow which is the now today
is the tomorrow of yesterday

what is yesterday's yesterday? 
what is the today of today? 

what will be the tomorrow of tomorrow? 

yesterday made today
today is creating tomorrow
the now today will be the
yesterday of the incoming tomorrow
and that tomorrow will become today

but tomorrow is yet  unknown


for there is no today without yesterday
and no yesterday without today

but tomorrow will be unknown


from wired thoughts
marchanism. 

The sea, the sand, 
We're hand in hand walking.
The breeze, fresh air, 
We stroll along talking.
Some kids at play, 
We run to them laughing.
The sun beats down, 
We're huffing and puffing.
Buckets and spades, 
We build a sandcastle.
The birds, the waves, 
We're having a paddle.
Wet feet in sand, 
Yeuck


Can anybody tell me
what's that stuff between my toes? 
My daddy says it's toe jam
but I don't think he really knows.

It's icky and it's fuzzy
and I think I'll tell my dad. 
I wouldn't put it on my bread
if it was the only jam we had

We will hold hands together
Laugh and smile together
Share our secrets together
And help each other together

We will confess our fears together
Wipe each other’s tears together
Confort each other together
And confide in each other together

We will talk about the darkness together
Write depressing poems together
Slit our wrists together
Scream in pain together

We will embrace sorrow together
Feel each other’s pain together
Plan our deaths together
And endure our suicides together


What gift can I give her in token of my love? 
It should be something most women think of! 
Something like a book, a perfume, or a rose.
She can read the book wherever she goes.
When she reads the book, my love grows
My name shall be on every page she reads.
It's not the book; it's my love she heeds.
I know women like perfumes so much.
I think a small bottle will be a nice touch.
Every time she wears some, I'll be around.
The scent she smells will keep her bound.
I think a rose or two will be a great gift! 
As women, we know, identify with it.
It could be red, yellow, white or pink.
A rose of any color is a joy they think.
I think a book, a perfume and a rose.
Shall bear witness to my noble cause.



The air lay soffly on the green fur 
of the almond, it was April 

and I said, I begin again 
but my hands burned in the damp earth 

the light ran between my fingers 
a black light like no other 

this was not home, the linnet 
settling on the oleander 

the green pod swelling 
the leaf slowly untwisting 

the slashed egg fallen from the nest 
the tongue of grass tasting 

I was being told by a pulse slowing 
in the eyes 

the dove mourning in shadow 
a nerve waking in the groin 

the distant hills 
turning their white heads away 

told by the clouds assembling 
in the trees, told by the blooming 

of a black mouth beneath the rose 
the worm sobbing, the dust 

settling on my eyelid, told 
by salt, by water, told and told. 

You are fire, 
i am the water, 
together i shall sizzle you. 

Curiosity perhaps killed many a cat
For a cat it is an inquisitive brat

All life poor thing it shall rummage through trash
Spring on the dinner table and the diner might bash! 

Famous might be a Tom cat for those famed nine lives
but not much help is that if in every danger it dives! 

It's feline curiosity to crash-land it in trouble
for it tends to explore every kind of rubble.

Mr. feral puss likes a fight and a wild-goose-chase.
Why forever look forward to yourself amuse and amaze? 

In a cat basket he's likely to be struck with ennui
Perhaps his caretaker thought only of his fengshui? 


His meowing screeching resonates in the valley
as he tussels with rival cats in the alley

Mr. Tom cat I tink I'll call you Mr. Mossy
but with feline femmes you're way too bossy

Wild and rough, with macho feral pride
I watch you tease and taunt in your typical stride.

No way is he kitty soft paws
Mr. 

Mossy sure has the sharpest claws.

Mossy the tabby and fishy leftover fish pie
kissed the feline females and made them cry.

But my fav is my own cutie pussy darling so soft
even if she may raid the loft that's aloftupon the Unemployed


Tom—garlanded with squat and surly steel 
Tom; then Tom’s fallowbootfellow piles pick 
By him and rips out rockfire homeforth—sturdy Dick; 
Tom Heart-at-ease, Tom Navvy: he is all for his meal 
Sure, ’s bed now. Low be it: lustily he his low lot (feel
That ne’er need hunger, Tom; Tom seldom sick, 
Seldomer heartsore; that treads through, prickproof, thick 
Thousands of thorns, thoughts) swings though. Commonweal
Little I reck ho! lacklevel in, if all had bread: 
What! Country is honour enough in all us—lordly head,
With heaven’s lights high hung round, or, mother-ground 
That mammocks, mighty foot. But no way sped, 
Nor mind nor mainstrength; gold go garlanded 
With, perilous, O no; nor yet plod safe shod sound; 
Undenizened, beyond bound
Of earth’s glory, earth’s ease, all; no one, nowhere, 
In wide the world’s weal; rare gold, bold steel, bare 
In both; care, but share care— 
This, by Despair, bred Hangdog dull; by Rage, 
Manwolf; worse; and their packs infest the age. 





Touch my lips with hollow kiss, 
Hang me out to dry
Fold my face with tender care
Before you bid me bye
A rose by any other name
Deserves a second look
Memories vanish in times stream
While resting in a book


An old road, 
But new tombs, aside in the fields; 
Worlds of different beings, 
Buried.
 
New wheat, green trees, 
The spring comes.
Cloudy though it is, 
Sunshine is here, forever.
 
Yes, it is.
That's what life should be. 


There is a section in my library for death
and another for Irish history,
a few shelves for the poetry of China and Japan,
and in the center a row of imperturbable reference books,
the ones you can turn to anytime,
when the night is going wrong
or when the day is full of empty promise.

 
I have nothing against
the thin monograph, the odd query,
a note on the identity of Chekhov's dentist,
but what I prefer on days like these
is to get up from the couch,
pull down The History of the World,
and hold in my hands a book
containing nearly everything
and weighing no more than a sack of potatoes,
eleven pounds, I discovered one day when I placed it
on the black, iron scale
my mother used to keep in her kitchen,
the device on which she would place
a certain amount of flour,
a certain amount of fish.

 
Open flat on my lap
under a halo of lamplight,
a book like this always has a way
of soothing the nerves,
quieting the riotous surf of information
that foams around my waist
even though it never mentions
the silent labors of the poor,
the daydreams of grocers and tailors,
or the faces of men and women alone in single rooms-
 
even though it never mentions my mother,
now that I think of her again,
who only last year rolled off the edge of the earth
in her electric bed,
in her smooth pink nightgown
the bones of her fingers interlocked,
her sunken eyes staring upward
beyond all knowledge,
beyond the tiny figures of history,
some in uniform, some not,
marching onto the pages of this incredibly heavy book. 

I put my seed into the ground
And said, 'I'll watch it grow.'
I watered it and cared for it
As well as I could know.

One day I walked in my back yard,
And oh. what did I see!
My seed had popped itself right out
Without consulting me. 



I

Tomorrow I will start to be happy.
The morning will light up like a celebratory cigar.
Sunbeams sprawling on the lawn will set
dew sparkling like a cut-glass tumbler of champagne.
Today will end the worst phase of my life.

I will put my shapeless days behind me,
fencing off the past, as a golden rind
of sand parts slipshod sea from solid land.
It is tomorrow I want to look back on, not today.
Tomorrow I start to be happy; today is almost yesterday.

                             II

Australia, how wise you are to get the day
over and done with first, out of the way.
You have eaten the fruit of knowledge, while
we are dithering about which main course to choose.
How liberated you must feel, how free from doubt:

the rise and fall of stocks, today’s closing prices
are revealed to you before our bidding has begun.
Australia, you can gather in your accident statistics
like a harvest while our roads still have hours to kill.
When we are in the dark, you have sagely seen the light.

                             III

Cagily, presumptuously, I dare to write 
A date without character or tone. 
A year without interest rates or mean daily temperature.
Its hit songs have yet to be written, its new-year
babies yet to be induced, its truces to be signed.

Much too far off for prophecy, though one hazards
a tentative guess—a so-so year most likely,
vague in retrospect, fizzling out with the usual
end-of-season sales; everything slashed:
your last chance to salvage something of its style. 



turn of
and close
the light
the door
let it be
no sound
no song
only silence
silence
silence
in your breath
let your heart
cross your mind
let it fly
let it dream
nobody can 
touch you now
hurt you more
let your cry
wash the pain
clean it again
for better
for worse
for tomorrow
to more row


The coolest day is tomorrow.
Tomorrow, without any sorrow, 
We'll do sport to lose weight
As we hate to be fat, 
But want to look like an acrobat.
Tomorrow we'll stop drinking, 
Tomorrow we'll stop smoking
And we'll certainly start reading.
We'll stop eating after six, 
And different food we won't mix.
But every day when we wake up, 
Without any makeup, 
We always greet today.
By the way, I also obey this play.



Observed and recorded
By old-time friends 
The great stack at Inverkip
Was brought down as I slept
Seven thousand miles 
And seven hours 
Beyond its reach.

We watched it grow
From across the river
In pre-teen awe.
Untouchable
The tallest thing



Massive as it was
It has no tomorrow.

But I’m still standing.
And tomorrow I’m seeing you. 

Long and unendurable nights
We are suffering from
Your absence

Waiting for
Your resurrection, Mother, 

And
Hoping for a tomorrow

We do believe
This tomorrow is going to be that tomorrow
You shall resurrect. 

let’s do this now.  


today, lets begin
for tomorrow is not promised, for anyone
i don't want to miss this
or loose out on this opportunity.
this is a dream, 
that i want to fulfill
let’s begin, 
today. 
before it’s tomorrow, 
and maybe to late


Tomorrow may be or may not be

Tomorrow may be tough
life's panorama goes rough

Tomorrow may be astounding
At your door, dreams screaming

Tomorrow may be nebulous

Tomorrow may be fanatical
pen is destiny, life story'd be article

Tomorrow may be magnificent
each day, gleeful and pleasant

Tomorrow may be for you, a lee
all the sorrows and worries will flee

Tomorrow may be for sheer felicity, harbinger
You've to aim your goals pulling trigger

Tomorrow may be a tree of magnolia
scattering in every moment, seducing aroma


So, Hira

Get ready for tomorrow
These rules you must follow; 

Work hard day and night
with your hurdles dauntlessly, fight

Always be calm and stoic
in any matter never get frantic

Trust yourself, don't ever stagger
towards your fortune, all the time swagger

And [the most important thing]

Pay gratitude
go to Him in weal and woe


Tomorrow is another day to be strong, 
Another day to hum a thankful song.

Tomorrow brings hope and happiness, 
It’s another day to chase away all classes of sadness, 
All categories of madness, and all species of silliness.

It is indeed another occasion to dream, 
Tomorrow will be pleasant; let’s scream, 
From the top of our lungs; let’s raise steam.

Tomorrow is another day to enjoy life.
It’s another hour to ignore the sighing wife.

Stop worrying, stop meditating;  tomorrow will come, 
With all styles of amenities, on top of the dome, 
A crowd of pigeons are about to paint our home.

Let’s enjoy today, because tomorrow is unpredictable.
The hummingbirds have retuned, they sitting at our table.
They are singing, chirping and eating the worms at the stable.

Tomorrow is a day of joy, a moment of happiness; 
Another pleasant day to admire the fall flowers. 


I turn around and walk away -
Tomorrow is another day, 
The past is done, I've closed the book, 
I'll never take another look; 
You've had your fun, you played your part, 
You stole my love then broke my heart
So easily without a care, 
How could you leave me standing there? 
I thought 'twas sadness in your eyes, 
I couldn't see through your disguise, 
I should have known you were untrue -
I was in love, why weren't you? 
Perhaps I've learned the sorry truth
I should have listened in my youth, 
A broken heart will surely mend -
Some loves will last, and some will end, 
And I will play the game again
Because I know one day I'll win, 
But now I turn and walk away

Tomorrow is another day.



Tomorrow is the laundry day
Though tomorrow’s bright and sunshine strikes
Seduce you to play outside
But duty must be priority
Washing the dirty to be clean again
And your day will feel light
After you do that

Tomorrow is the laundry day
Though tomorrow’s cloudy and can’t stop rainy
Bother you with damp laundry
But duty is duty
Washing the dirty so it won’t be stinky
And your day will be bright
After you do that

Tomorrow is the laundry day
Though your laundry is already loaded
And you don’t want to see or touch 
But duty must be completed
Washing the dirty so it ready to be used
And your day will feel more comfortable
After you do that

Tomorrow is the laundry day
Though your heart grumbles "Later"
No, do not listen that lazy one
Duty is to be worked not be grouch
Washing is a fun job if your heart happy
And your day will be victory
After you do that'Tomorrow' -  whose location
The Wise deceives
Though its hallucination
Is last that leaves - 
Tomorrow -  thou Retriever
Of every tare - 
Of Alibi art thou
Or ownest where


Different seasons will come and go, come and go
The bee humming birds fly away and don’t always return
The perennial plants hibernate and grow
Bigger branches and buds that make men yearn.

Tomorrow will come no matter what, no matter what
Occasionally, your neighbors will see it
And you won’t, and you find yourself deep in a lot
That your love ones had to rush to get.

Tomorrow is maybe your last day; every day
You ought to behave as though you’ll be away
Momentarily; because the last breath is unpredictable
No one accepts the obvious and foresees the inevitable.


There is no future, there is tomorrow
Tomorrow shall come, drown in sorrow
Dressed like a crow whose daily attendance
At funerals, is not classified and is in full compliance.

Enjoy life and today to the fullest, be positive
And help as much as your heart desires
The heaven’s hole is infinitesimal and active
For incalculable reasons and inaudible satires.

Tomorrow will come, but most of your plans
Will not materialize; we are surrounded by death
By unavoidable nightmares and discolored wreaths
We are daily being applauded by unrecognized fans.

At times, the magnets are mightily powerful
Pessimism is not the answer to the realities
Of our journey, the bouquet of the lilies
Will not remain fresh and youthful.

Different seasons will come and go, come and go
The perennial plants hibernate and grow
Mother Earth will claim her children’s dust and sand 
And their spirit will perpetually wander like the wind. 

                 

Why are you in such a hurry to grow up? 
Relax a little, take your time, slow up.
There's no rush believe me, you need to slow down
Chill with friends, watch TV, go out on the town
Listen to music, play computer get high.
Why are you in such a hurry to die? 

The world of the grown is dreary and sad, 
If your still a child, you should be glad
What to expect? Hold up let me see
Taxes and bills and major school fees
Headaches and groans, backache and loans. 

Do not strike the chord of sorrow tonight! 
Days burning with pain turn to ashes.
Who knows what happens tomorrow? 
Last night is lost; tomorrow's frontier wiped out: 
Who knows if there will be another dawn? 
Life is nothing, it's only tonight! 
Tonight we can be what the gods are! 

Do not strike the chord of sorrow, tonight! 
Do not repeat stories of sufferings now, 
Do not complain, let your fate play its role, 
Do not think of tomorrows, give a damn-
Shed no tears for seasons gone by, 
All sighs and cries wind up their tales, 
Oh, do not strike the same chord again


Tonight at noon 
Supermarkets will advertise  EXTRA on everything 
Tonight at noon 
Children from happy families will be sent to live in a home 
Elephants will tell each other human jokes 
America will declare peace on Russia 
World War I generals will sell poppies in the streets on November h 
The first daffodils of autumn will appear 
When the leaves fall upwards to the trees

Tonight at noon 
Pigeons will hunt cats through city backyards 
Hitler will tell us to fight on the beaches and on the landing fields 
A tunnel full of water will be built under Liverpool 
Pigs will be sighted flying in formation over Woolton and Nelson will
not only get his eye back but his arm as well 
White Americans will demonstrate for equal rights in front of the Black House 
and the Monster has just created Dr Frankenstein

Girls in bikinis are moonbathing 
Folksongs are being sung by real folk 


There's jobs for everyone and nobody wants them 
In back alleys everywhere teenage lovers are kissing in broad daylight

In forgotten graveyards everywhere the dead will quietly 
bury the living 
and 
You will tell me you love me 
Tonight at noon


Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

Write, for example,'The night is shattered
and the blue stars shiver in the distance.'

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.

Through nights like this one I held her in my arms
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.

She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too.
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.

To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.

What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
The night is shattered and she is not with me.

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

My sight searches for her as though to go to her.
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

The same night whitening the same trees.
We, of that time, are no longer the same.


I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.

Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.
Her voide. Her bright body. Her inifinite eyes.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. 
Love is so short, forgetting is so long.

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
my sould is not satisfied that it has lost her.

Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that I write for her. 


Floating atop a sea of feathers; 
Sheets tangling around my ankles
Pulling me under

Ready to be devoured by the earth
And suffocated by blankets

Only if it would mean getting a wink of sleep
Because if I can only be with you in my dreams

Let me dream tonight


The wind is still tonight, the night is cool.
Let's be together tonight, and watch the moon full.
Take my hands, and be seated, please.
Listen to my heart and say what you choose
Be more closer and never let emotions loose.
Be my soul's soul and give me a kiss.
Let's walk to the life for ever and ever
Hand in hand, side by side, and  break up never. 

The wind is still tonight, the night is cool.
Let's be together tonight, and watch the moon full.
Take my hands, and be seated, please.
Listen to my heart and say what you choose
Be more closer and never let emotions loose.
Be my soul's soul and give me a kiss.
Let's walk to the life for ever and ever
Hand in hand, side by side, and  break up never.


Too cold is this
To warm with Sun - 
Too stiff to bended be,
To joint this Agate were a work - 
Outstaring Masonry - 

How went the Agile Kernel out
Contusion of the Husk
Nor Rip, nor wrinkle indicate
But just an Asterisk. 


A smile, a laugh, a kind word and then
Another day and a moment with you
Could it really be that all this is right
It just seems, to me, too good to be true

Is it my imagination again
A masterpiece so beautifully made
Could it truly be portrayed alongside
A tapestry so beaten, torn, and frayed

What if none of this dream is really real
What if I take a chance and step ahead
Just to watch and lament as all fades back
And, the fear rings true, 'twas all in my head

But, try I must; chances like these are rare
May true love grow with the future to bear



I never thought I’d see you too soon.
Remember when I wanted you but, 
You were too cool and just kept shut.

Why are you walking over to me? 
Why is it now that you see
That I’m alive and look a bit different
Instead before when your heart was absent.

You get closer and it’s like a wave
I can’t breathe, I sweat, it’s you I crave
Why do you still get me, its been years
I remember the times and all those tears.

I remember how I wanted you
You said one day you’d want me too
You lead me on and broke my heart
I should have known it from the start.

Why now do you appear? 
When I am happy without you here
You ask me for one last chance, 
A night filled with endless romance.


You can’t do this, you’re too late
I’m happy now, there’s no debate. 
You had your chance but missed out
I’ve got someone that doesn’t mess about.

You still make me weak
Why is it you that I seek
It might just be a habit
It’s you from my life I must edit.

You're too late, I say no more
I can’t go there and see what’s in store
It’s finished and you’re just a mate
It’s over now, you're too late. 


As time's gone by
Your love I felt
You didn't know why
I wouldn't say it

But I'll say it now
Even tho it's too late
I want you to know
My love is great

You helped me live
And for your return
Nothing I gave
And nothing I could earn

So I love you still
Even tho it wont matter
If I say it until
Our friendship shatters.



Too little way the House must lie
From every Human Heart
That holds in undisputed Lease
A white inhabitant—

Too narrow is the Right between—
Too imminent the chance—
Each Consciousness must emigrate
And lose its neighbor once—


Seven long years, 
and ten longer months. 
Many filled with tears-
the build up was too much. 

Waiting for our Wedding Day, 
planning every detail. 
At times it seemed too far away- 
time being carried by a snail. 

-

Invitations stamped and ready! 
Thinking of nothing else! 
All my efforts into keeping my heart steady- 
Six weeks till rings, tux, and dress! 

-

The First of November
Vows, pictures, cake and punch. 
Everything-so easy to remember


but the build up was too much. 

Honeymoon's over they say, 
reality hits fast and hard. 
After the last bill is paid, 
every thank you for every card. 

Don't get me wrong-
marriage, it's everything I expected. 
I just didn't know planning it so long-
the lack-there-of would make me feel to wretched. 

Now everything that used to make me smile, 
wedding ads, white cakes, dresses in store fronts. 
Anything leading up to walking down that aisle-
makes me want to lose my lunch


Because the build up, was too much. 

Too much for today's society
Too many deaths in the family
Too much violence in the streets.

Too many hostilities by the police
Too many deaths by the police
Too many murderers in the streets.

Too many innocent victims
Too many in the wrong teams
Too many are lost in the reams.

Too many hostilities by the police
Too many deaths by the terrorists
Too many bad things in the streets.

Too many criminals are on the loose
Too many murderers in the police force
Too many innocents on the crosses.

Too many elephants on the horses
Too many deaths in our family
Too much for today's society.
Too many unsolved murders
Too many slimy perpetrators
Too many cadavers in the craters.

Too many hypocrites in our democracy
Too many bullies are roaming the streets
Too many crazy ants are warming up the seats.

Too many are crying, weeping and sobbing
Too many are protesting, yelling and wailing
Too many are suffering silently and yowling.

Too many cries
Too many lies
Too many spies.

Things are now out of control
Too many officers are on parole
Too many vultures on the pole.

Too many innocents are sitting in jail
Too many bad cops are out on bail
Too many snakes are lying on the rail.


Too many bad laws for the masses
Too few students are attending classes
Too many judges are acting like foxes.

Too many children are lost in the system
Too many leaders do not give a damn
Too many will do anything for an iota of fame.

When will these mayhems end? 
When will we see justice on this land? 
When will we write peace in the sand? 

Too many cops are on parole
Things are now out of control
Too many vultures are on the pole.

Things are now out of control
Too many deaths in the family
Too much for today's society. 


Two former lovers are now enemies
The household is literally on fire
And the poor children are in the streets
The ex-couple is calling each other liar
Both participants are wrong
Obviously, they are not strong
They are weak, strange, confused and selfish
They put the dogs to sleep
They drowned and killed the fish
Their emotions are volatile and deep
Separation or divorce is hell
The oldest son is in jail
The youngest daughter is pregnant
Out of wedlock. Divorce is a bad event
The former love birds now hate each other
And the other kids are smoking cracks in the corner.


Divorce is a terrible tragedy
Why are some people fighting to get married? 
This is well known, the number one answer is: MONEY
Oh! For benefits, fame, arrogance, and greed
The household is no more, gone with the wind
Dilapidated and buried in the sand
Divorce is like the devil, like hell
Please silent the lonely bell
There is a funeral procession
The dogs are barking and there is a recession
The neighbors are depressed
Both families are distressed
The love is gone and is replaced with hatred
No one is exempt and no marriage is sacred
There is too much hate
From the former mate
Divorce is an awful event
Where there is no advancement
No progress or no contentment
Fortunately, it is never too late repent. 

Too much love for one heart-
Too much love, tears me apart. 
Too much love to give to you.
Too much love, enough for two. 


Too much money is as bad as too little
Because you're rich, that's not a reason
To belittle
No one.
Many billionaires are con men
Who are not caught yet
I suspect
That I am not their fan.
With too little or no money
You're treated like you're worthless
Because you're penniless
And hungry.
People forget that you have a brain
Blood is flowing in your veins
In spite of the sins
You're still sane.
Too little money is as bad as too much
Because you're poor, that's not a reason
To be searched
Like a con man. 


Sometimes I feel old, hundreds of years old
Covered with cobwebs and vines

Sometimes I feel weightless, other times, hard
But not rugged, just packed in real tight

There are times I feel see-through
Like I'm here, but I'm not

Times I feel a burning sensation
Like I'm ice on fire

Times I feel heavy-hearted and think
My heart's going to pull me down

And times I feel deaf or blind
Not seeing a thing, or hearing a sound


Times I feel dirty though I'm clean
Times I feel worthless, times I feel hated
Times I feel desperate, times I feel anxious
Times I feel slow, times I feel jittery
Times I feel low, times I don't feel a thing

Individually, such feelings aren't too much to bare
but it's when, all at once, they are there.  


Too much violence in our schools
Too much violence in our streets
Too many bullies, too many fools
Own machine guns, deadly Uzis
And other high- powered weapons
To avert or to avoid so much bloodshed.

Our children are dying in our schools
No one is safe, no one is spared
Too many bullies, too many fools
Are spraying the venom of death
In our community and neighborhood
Too much violence on earth
Too many guns are hidden under the hood
Under the seat, in the book bag
I am pleading with you, I want to beg
You to stop this nonsense
There is way too much violence.

Let's all protect our children
Our little cherubim and angels
Please keep Satan and his devils
Far away from our homes, schools, 
Churches, streets and hospitals
Too many sick puppies, too many fools
Are heavily armed in our malls
There is way too much violence
Let's find a way to stop this nonsense. 

Facts are facts.
Too raw to take back.
Although there are those, 
Who would rather propose, 
Hiding them away behind a door closed.
Facts are facts.
And the rawness of them. 
Can be thought by some, 
To have their pretensions attacked.

As a 'black' man I have been told, 
My approach to being so. 
Was not bold or black enough, 
By those who believed. 
On my sleeves this should be.
And my activities did not represent, 
Their cause.
And 'what' was their 'cause'? 
Reminding themselves and others, 
On a daily basis and by their actions. 
Not only were they 'black', 
But they wanted to 'show' themselves as that.
And I thought to myself. 
Isn't my presence proof enough? 
Apparently not.
Some even told me I had forgot.

And those who were not. 
Apparently 'black'. 
Would say my manner of speech, 
And the way I walked. 
Didn't remind them of black folks at all.
Not the ones they saw, 
Shopping in the malls.


Facts are facts.
Too raw to take back.

'When' I was a Negro, 
Young and full of adventure to know and grow. 
Negros 'then' only wanted to be free.
Negros 'then' only wanted equality with opportunity.


'When' I became Black and Proud, 
With a doing of it to say out loud. 
Martha and The Vandellas had us 'Dancing In The Streets'.
And racists all over the place became appalled, 
By this declaration of identity. 
In segregated communities shown to them on TV.

And 'then' I became an African-American, 
With that label to bear.
And from that day I wore that label, 
To pay homage to my ancestors. 
Who were neither slaves or felt subservient.
But they were strong with dignity.
To flaunt this with a daring.
And with a flair meant to be.


Today? 
Everyone, everywhere seems to be in denial.
With an array of topics debated and placed on trial.
And having discussions without a shred of truth to face, 
In the hopes that discussions of race would go away.
Leaving those who 'are' black the ones most affected, 
By a racism that is highly detected.
And only 'blacks' are the ones, 
Who expect with anticipation to have to them this done.

Where do we as a people collectively go from here? 
How about a field trip taken to sit and visit with truth? 
With a doing to expose raw discussions.
And removing those delusions, 
Until a truth felt is produced.
OR. 
We can continue to ignore a ravaged quilt, 
Once knitted to build to eliminate guilt.
Yet being unravelled and ripped apart.
By an ignorance so intense from it we can't depart.


The children of today seem to accept with a caring less.
As long as their priorities are kept, 
To address their preferences for sex. 
With the latest fads to address.
And where they can get real cheap the best drugs.
It's only the ones with their insecurities unfaced to be done, 
Wishing divisions and their symbolic myths. 
Continue to be accepted with a dishonesty to exist! 
This. 
Has to be overcomed.


Facts are facts.
Too raw to take back.
Although there are those, 
Who would rather propose, 
Hiding them away behind a door closed.
Facts are facts.
And the rawness of them. 
Can be thought by some, 
To have their pretensions attacked.
But then, 
Again. 


If there is going to be 'any' progress, 
Trivia kept and its nonsense. 
Has to be truthfully confessed.
To rid the fear leaving nothing for us left, 
To impress or address with interest. 

While you were away, 
It was difficult to stay completely without you. 
Here on my mind all the time.
And how it is I could not remain real.
You are not to be substituted.
Nothing about you can be diluted to delude.

While you were away, 
It was harder to say whatever you did. 
Was not noticeably missed.
It was.
Every contributing nuance and piece of it, 
Came to life to be revealed.

And. 
You have the keys to unlock and open, 
The excitement felt in my heart.
And. 
You more than can show, 
Why I have adored you from the very start.
And. 
How it is to feel, 
Real.

While you were away, 
I knew. 
Nothing about you can be diluted to delude.
You, 
Just keep it too real. 

The wanting with it wished to get, 
That 'something' dreamed of. 
Without sweat, sacrifice or commitment, 
As an incentive to give time. 
To define what is imagined in the mind, 
One day to find has become real to feel. 
With a belief that pleases.
And. 
Takes mistakes to make and correct.
And not object the inspecting, 
Of a nose that sniffs for details.
Sometimes what is 'commissioned'. 
Leaves left unspoken conditions.

'There is only one little thing missing, 
From your exquisite exhibition.'

~What? ~

'You mentioned the sky.
In some of your submitted work.
But did not describe the color of it.
Is it blue? What shade? 
It seems you wish us to feel. 
Your anguish and bitterness felt, 
During those times prior to finding. 
Your true identity as an artist.
So multi-talented you are.
Where is that found identity, 
We love to have had much more exhibited.'

~Everyone knows the sky is always blue.
Cloudless and bright with rays of Sun.
Rays that have come with a light, 
Once the shadows clear from the mind.
That has helped me live without darkness.
Especially those dreaded days and nights.
My life to like I have found to love.~

'That might be your kept belief.
But your presentation depicts. 
Anger, disappointment, fear and hopelessness.
Gloom, division and isolation.'

~Oh. THAT? 
I'm over it now.
I wanted to present something more accepted.
You know. 
Something current and available.
Accessible to today's tormented souls.~

'That's the 'little' thing that's missing.
We promoted you as a gifted artist.
Not someone to remind us, 
Of the doom and gloom we know too well.'

~But. 
You requested I stay true to detail.~

'Not 'our' lives to live to depict.  

detailed.
That's too realistic.
We were hoping you would deliver to us, 
YOUR discovery. YOUR findings. 
Of personal worth and realized happiness.
Something we believe you have fantasized.
You should know by now. 
How we regard truth and reality as offensive.
To continue to ignore the truth of it.'

~So. 
What is it you expect me to do? 
Be contradicting? Hypocritical? ~

'Well. 
Is asking you to deceive, 
Just a little bit. 
Too much of you to ask? 
You know. 
Be more delusional.
With the use of your creative license.
You artists love twisting a mind or two.'

~You mean, 
Lie? ~

'Nooooo. 
Don't be so harsh on yourself.
Entertaining. Entertain us.
Who will know the difference? 
Don't take yourself so seriously.
Very few people do.

'Your excess has left you unacceptible! 
Your extremes of self importance, 
Is too reserved and self absorbing! 
I called out to you once to watch. 
Your knickers and your pocket clock! 
But you had not stop moaning, 
About Blue Moons and ships that sailed! 
And I fail to care what the hell you mean

Strange are those days, 
I see changing.
Strange, 
Are those appetites.

Some people love to nibble on life.
Not to eat it up, 
But to spit out pieces of it they don't like! 

Strange are those days, 
I see changing.
Strange, 
Are those appetites.

So much abundance is out there, 
But they see limits.
Abundance is out there, 
But they choose limits! 
And bondage, 
To capitalize on those inhibitions.

Severe is the pain they keep deep in their hearts.
Severe is the agony that keeps them apart.
Although neither will admit it to quit or say, 
Just how severe.
Yet they fear, 
Not being with each other.
Or being near.
They're just.  

too severe.

Too stubborn not to give their stubbornness a quck check up.
And too stubborn not to brush away their foolish stuff.
They are. 
Too severe, 
In the playing of this game they are.

Overplaying in a game they are.

Too restrictive and fearing in their stubbornness,

it's the first time (I'm in love) 
I have feeling like this
my eyes always searching you
your perfect smile to me

when you walk to me (dance with me) 
and say 'I love you'
my mouth lost in words
but I promise this to you

we are young but old enough
to try the world and begin story love
maybe I'm afraid, maybe I don't trust in you
but if you don't play with my heart
you love me naturally
I will give all my love and I never doubt again

don't look at like that (begging me) 
I won't hide from you
I just need little time
if I bloom only for you


My heart is at  degrees
You can shift it and pull it around with ease
Bend it and shape it, go on, it's elastic
It must be a rubber band made from plastic
You broke it, I fixed it, she pushed it down from its cloud
And this is too twisted to even write poems about


Been to Taco Bell or Taco Bueno lately for Super Bean Burrito? 
Been lactose intolerant lately? 
You forgot your Beano? 
Do have the urge to pass a gaseous nebula from your (inner) space? 
Do you feel like east Texas’s Natural Gas Supplier? 

Never fear for recorded music is here.
You don’t have to hide your toots out of fear.
You can be in your library, 
on your throne, 
Listening to some better, 
more harmonious music.


Get Toilet Tunes.

It’s kind of like MUZAK for your butt, 
As you prepare sit down on your Koehler Cheated seat, 
You lift up seat the music turns on, 
Vice-versa, 

(After you’re done, you can select to tear your tissue away from the i


Carta + toilet paper holder) 

Latin, Jazz, Modern, Waves and Stream, 
Talking about 'live-streaming' you guys, 
you have to lift the lid totally up, 
You may short the system out, 
All of this for a minimal cost.
It costs $plus $for handling and shipping, 
Making it about ten cents shy of 'farty' dollars.

((Letterman style countdown)   

Number Ten:   Because I probably lack the skill to determine where another’s failings lie
Number Nine:   Because I doubt that anyone else really has such infallible skill
Number Eight:   Because I lack the desire to render negative opinions of another’s work
Number Seven:   Because I question the true motives of any one who readily renders scathing critiques
Number Six:   Because I believe in positive reinforcement rather than accentuating negatives
Number Five:   Because I don’t wish to have any hand in discouraging or killing the dreams of other poets
Number Four:   Because I believe that what people write is far more important than the skill they show in doing it.
Number Three:   Because the majority of poetry derives from a warm heart and most criticism originates from cold indifferent intellect
Number Two:   Because I know what it feels like to be on the other end of the equation

And the Number One reason I would make a lousy poetry critic: 

Because, poetically speaking, I live in a glass house. 

After we flew across the country we
got in bed, laid our bodies
delicately together, like maps laid
face to face, East to West, my
San Francisco against your New York, your
Fire Island against my Sonoma, my 
New Orleans deep in your Texas, your Idaho
bright on my Great Lakes, my Kansas 
burning against your Kansas your Kansas
burning against my Kansas, your Eastern
Standard Time pressing into my 
Pacific Time, my Mountain Time
beating against your Central Time, your 
sun rising swiftly from the right my 
sun rising swiftly from the left your 
moon rising slowly form the left my 
moon rising slowly form the right until 
all four bodies of the sky
burn above us, sealing us together, 
all our cities twin cities, 
all our states united, one 
nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 

There is no truth to the person I am, 
ev’ry detail’s a bold-faced lie.
What seems to be is really not
in this world of confusion.

Then I met you, and upside-down
was turned upside-down.
So maybe now it’s right-side up, 
but I would beg to differ.

Upside-down was upside-down
yet turned over it is no better.
Lies will be lies no matter what, 
yet somehow lies will always be truth. 

IF the butterfly courted the bee,  
 And the owl the porcupine;  
If churches were built in the sea,  
 And three times one was nine;  
If the pony rode his master, 
 If the buttercups ate the cows,  
If the cats had the dire disaster  
 To be worried, sir, by the mouse;  
If mamma, sir, sold the baby  
 To a gypsy for half a crown;
If a gentleman, sir, was a lady,—  
 The world would be Upside-down!  
If any or all of these wonders  
 Should ever come about,  
I should not consider them blunders,
 For I should be Inside-out!  
 
            Chorus

Ba-ba, black wool,  
 Have you any sheep?  
Yes, sir, a packfull,  
 Creep, mouse, creep!
Four-and-twenty little maids  
 Hanging out the pie,  
Out jump’d the honey-pot,  
 Guy Fawkes, Guy!  
Cross latch, cross latch, 
 Sit and spin the fire;  
When the pie was open’d,  
 The bird was on the brier

If you should look for this place after a handful 
        of lifetimes:
Perhaps of my planted forest a few
May stand yet, dark-leaved Australians or the coast 
        cypress, haggard
With storm-drift; but fire and the axe are devils.
Look for foundations of sea-worn granite, my fingers 
        had the art
To make stone love stone, you will find some remnant.
But if you should look in your idleness after ten 
        thousand years:
It is the granite knoll on the granite
And lava tongue in the midst of the bay, by the mouth 
        of the Carmel
River-valley, these four will remain
In the change of names. You will know it by the wild 
        sea-fragrance of wind
Though the ocean may have climbed or retired a little;
You will know it by the valley inland that our sun 
        and our moon were born from
Before the poles changed; and Orion in December
Evenings was strung in the throat of the valley like 
        a lamp-lighted bridge.
Come in the morning you will see white gulls
Weaving a dance over blue water, the wane of the moon
Their dance-companion, a ghost walking
By daylight, but wider and whiter than any bird in 
        the world.
My ghost you needn't look for; it is probably
Here, but a dark one, deep in the granite, not 
        dancing on wind
With the mad wings and the day moon.




When you go beneath your shutter
All gondoliers call out:
Watch out--Toreador!
No one rules your heart
In the grand palace where you sleep
And near you the old duenna lies in waiting
for the Toreador.
Toreador, bravest of the brave
When in Piazza San Marco
The wild, slobbering bull
Falls slain by your blade
It is not pride that caresses
Your heart beneath your golden cape
It is for a young goddess
That your passion burns, toreador.

(refrain)

Lovely Spanish girl
In your gondola
Dancing and prancing
Carmencita
Under your mantilla
Sparkling eyes
Shining mouth
That's Pepita

Tomorrow is St. Escurio's Day,
With its combat to the death
The canal is full of sails
Celebrating the Toreador
More than one Venetian beauty
Trembles to know your fate
But you despise all their laces—you suffer—
Toreador.
Since not seeing her appear
Hidden behind an orange tree,
Pepita alone at her window
You think about vengeance.
Under your caftan slips your dagger
Jealousy gnaws at your heart
And alone with the noise of the waves
You weep toreador.

So many horsemen! so great a crowd!
Filling the arena to its limits
From a hundred leagues people keep coming
To cheer you—Toreador!
And so he enters the arena
With more composure than a lord
But he can scarcely walk, the poor
Toreador.
His gloomy dream contains no more
Than to die before the eyes of all
As he feels the piercing of those horns
Within his sad, troubled brow
He sees Pepita sitting there,
Offering her gaze and her body
To the oldest doge of Venice
Laughing at the toreador. 


Squeezes
My hands
The cold

With
Hands
Invisible

Hard as iron
To produce
An agonising
pain

But
From the blaze
Of fire

Came the heat

It freed
My hands
By dissolving

The cold's
Hands. 


Mine is Gopal, the Mountain-Holder; there is no one else.
On his head he wears the peacock-crown: He alone is my husband. 
Father, mother, brother, relative: I have none to call my own. 
I've sat near the holy ones, and I've lost shame before the people. 
I've torn my scarf into shreds; I'm all wrapped up in a blanket. 
I took off my finery of pearls and coral, and strung a garland of wildwood flowers.
With my tears, I watered the creeper of love that I planted;
Now the creeper has grown spread all over, and borne the fruit of bliss.
The churner of the milk churned with great love.
When I took out the butter, no need to drink any buttermilk.
I came for the sake of love-devotion; seeing the world, I wept. 
Mira is the maidservant of the Mountain-Holder: now with love 
He takes me across to the further shore.




How, in the first place, did
they get torn-pulled down hard
too many times: to hide a blow,
or sex, or a man
in stained pajamas? The tear blade-shaped,
serrated, in tatters. And once,
in a house flatside to a gas station, 
as snow fell at a speed and angle you could lean on,
two small hands (a patch of throat, a whip
of hair across her face)-
two small hands
parting a torn shade
to welcome a wedge of gray sunlight into that room. 

i dream, i promise, 
i break up, 
i shatter, 
like unstable, 
moments, 
in the life, 
countless, 
in occasions, 
but, 
i still wonder, 
over, 
my internal distortions, 
viable, 
noises, raised up to neck, 
occasional severity, 
in behavior disorder, 
and shutdown, 
of all random priorities, 
to pay breaths as ransom, 
to life, 
with fetters over body, 
emptying my lungs, 
with labored exhale, 
how you can believe, 
when lies are, 
ornaments of face, 
and swamps of sins, 
to drag me in, 
you are generous, 
to offer me, 
your hand, 
in epic moments, 
with traction of my arm, 
but gravity, 
increasing my weight, 
to infinity, 
death comes, 
with light speed, 
Einstein writes, 
EMC 
on my fore head, 
Alexander conquers my will, 
Aristotle confuses, 
the situation, 
whatever, 
it may be, 
hidden, 
and dormant, 
t ornaments, 
erupting from the soil.

Torrential Rains

Tell me fast rains, 
Why do you fall
On all of us below you? 
On all things under? 

I thought we all like sunshine
And in that thinking
All is well.
But now I see properly.

Torrential rains
Wipe out the dirt
The dust of our lives.
It purifies the Earth.

I welcome you torrential rains.
Rain in my garden.
Rain on my body
And rain all day in my soul.

Oh torrential rain. 

When they torture your mother
plant a tree
When they torture your father
plant a tree
When they torture your brother
and your sister
plant a tree
When they assassinate
your leaders
and lovers
plant a tree
Whey they torture you
too bad
to talk
plant a tree.
When they begin to torture
the trees
and cut down the forest
they have made
start another. 



Near my longing heart she lives, 
I can't be safe ere love she gives, 
When I want to be closely near her, 
When I advance in both her love and care, 
And when the stars watch us here and there, 
And when the moon hugs us both me and her, 
Then, she, in my sleep, becomes a nightmare, 
That would bring misery, pain and despair, 
Honey, restore love to me and thee, 
For only your love that can really be, 
My pulse from birth to death. Just see! ! 
You are every pulse my heart needs, 
You are every brook of love and seeds.

   * * * * * * * * * * * *
Let cowards cast  aspersions on our love, 
Let tale-tellers sustain and prove, 
Let slanderers gossip against our love, 
Let all know that each other we love, 
For does it disturb them to be in love? 
Or is it forbidden to have a baby like a dove? 
All people shall know my love for thee is deep, 
And only love of thee I swear to keep.

  * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
Love cures all our deep sorrows, 
It makes lovers lovely sparrows, 
Love is only felt, and made of souls, 
It never spoils folks or them appalls, 
It only lifts them to the seventh Heaven, 
Where faith, loyalty and salvation are given, 
Love overwhelms all atoms of the heart, 
It strikes us all with a crazy start, 
Then we begin to follow its departures, 
That would reach not only man but all creatures

   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
Love does not change, nor does it disappear, 
It's like sunbeams that sink, and then appear, 

Love does not torture us, 
But the one we love does,

TORTURED 
Words and lies that cut deep 
That makes your heart weep
Makes it hard to sleep
Have you ever see someone tortured? 
Bleeding out like ink, 
While looking into the eyes 
While life is leaving their eyes, 
Having no words that could easy the pain
My thoughts of sorrow 
lasting longer than tomorrow, 
Poets of ancient time 
Had seen the ink that was bleed out
While the hearts sink
Words of true knowledge was written
In a world of the forbidden, 
Deliberate torture is a sickening
and abhorrent, 
bleeding heart are being written
While the souls cry out in their own 
blood stain ink; 
Life and Death we all must face
memories and agony's
that evil gave, but in darken dreams
you can see anything of curtly
where winter winds are always calling 
where rainstorms are always brewing, 
where the flesh made a bed
bones and ashes are in the mirror 
that broken the glass
of my beaten down past, 
the windows of my life 
cut deep with a knife, 
to lead me out of the pit, 
Words and sound kept me bond, 
I cried out in merciful tears
But true love never came near, 
I got lost into my fears; 
clowns of the darken town
are being crowned for their dirty deeds, 
while my mind roamed around
my heart wasn't yet found; 
while my own spirit is being tortured, 
where coldness taken over 
while I was being abused; 
I felt so used because of Dark Angel; 
this world of darkness is a big mess
that gives sickness to the mind, 
tortured day and night
Oh, how I can hear the cries 
They are now becoming lullabies
in my life; 
every day is a darkness of old memories
cut deep at me; 
for all to read what it is I bleed.





Oh, soul, so tortured, tormented and torn
Between this great love gained and love forlorn
Irony.  How cruel to a lover's heart
Her soul to find, only to be apart

On these days, I wish not to have been born
Oh, soul, so tortured, tormented and torn
With lovers together, faces of glee
Only thoughts of how far she is from me

Aye, all days are not to be joy-laden
Naught are these.   I, dreaming of my maiden
Oh, soul, so tortured, tormented and torn
Won't you take from my mind this painful thorn? 

Though halt that request if it were to be
By removing pain, she'd be lost to me
I'd make the sacrifice and lonely mourn
Oh, soul, so tortured, tormented and torn



Nothing has changed.
The body is susceptible to pain,
it must eat and breathe air and sleep,
it has thin skin and blood right underneath,
an adequate stock of teeth and nails,
its bones are breakable, its joints are stretchable.
In tortures all this is taken into account. 

Nothing has changed.
The body shudders as it shuddered
before the founding of Rome and after,
Tortures are as they were, it's just the earth that's grown smaller,
and whatever happens seems right on the other side of the wall. 

Nothing has changed. It's just that there are more people,
besides the old offenses new ones have appeared,
real, imaginary, temporary, and none,
but the howl with which the body responds to them,
was, is and ever will be a howl of innocence
according to the time-honored scale and tonality.

Nothing has changed. Maybe just the manners, ceremonies, dances.
Yet the movement of the hands in protecting the head is the same.
The body writhes, jerks and tries to pull away,
its legs give out, it falls, the knees fly up,
it turns blue, swells, salivates and bleeds. 

Nothing has changed. Except for the course of boundaries,
the line of forests, coasts, deserts and glaciers.
Amid these landscapes traipses the soul,
disappears, comes back, draws nearer, moves away,
alien to itself, elusive, at times certain, at others uncertain of its own existence,
while the body is and is and is
and has no place of its own. 



We went left, we're slammed
We went right, we're damned
That was total chaos
That was a farce
We got hit by a deadly earthquake
Now we're destroyed by a hurricane
What do we do now? 
There is one thing: we vow
To stay alive
To survive
No matter what
Like a fat rat.


Not wanting to write
for fear that anything-
the passion for the page,
the love of carbon ribbons & erasers-
will distract me from your face,
from your eyes green
as the flickering base of flames,
& your tarnished copper hair.

My love is thick as rust
& just as hard to scrape off.
It glows like the green roofs of paris:
it shines in the sun like dropped pennies.

I fix on your face
until I am blurred & bleared,
until my eyes cannot focus
& all words become one.

Oh let me write you into my life!
I am afraid of rust & tarnish,
but even more afraid of this gleam.

When my eyes have taken you in,
when my body has eaten
& spat you out,
when my heart remembers to beat
& my fingers remember the pen-

will I still remember you then,
boyish & sly-
yet a total eclipse of my sun


Read the philosophical question: Does something exist 
if nobody is experiencing it - a Walkman playing when 
nobody with earplugs is listening, illustrates it is com-
pletely irrelevant to wonder whether something exists 
if it is not experienced by us 

I am totally happy to believe that a superconsciousness 
experiences everything real and imaginary - therefore 
infinity means all possibilities, probable & improbable, 
can and does exist in this and all alternative universes 
that we are able to visualise

Once we accept there are no boundaries except those 
we set ourselves, once we believe the rules governing 
our own universe are not universally applicable – and 
relativism means all experience is limited by context 
and situation, therefore changing these 

Means each set of circumstances is subject to its own 
set of rules or could be completely free; we cannot pre-
determine the answer to every possible question, life 
will always pose a mystery, a puzzle, an unending 
quest - this realisation sets us free 

From all limitations imposed by other minds and 
external powers; we all have unlimited freedom to 
decide what we admire, believe and desire, nobody 
can ever prescribe or decide for us – this defines 
our total freedom

Far below us there are salt mines
From ancient seas.
And fossils from millions of
Of years ago.

But yet I am told that they were put there 
To confuse the evolutionists
What plan is that I ask myself.

When millions of soldiers and non-combatants
Died in the two World wars, and a holocaust that decimated the jewish, old men, children and women.
People that died in terror.
Where was he? 

Appearing at  a time of disaster or war
Would it be wonderful
To see a great hope.
Can you imagine the media! 
War is no more, diseases are controlled.

It confuses me because I have belief in him.
Yet no one has returned with the good news, 
In years.
I really want' to see him
But he is like an uncle that I never see. 

Somewhere there is a me, 
I'm looking and looking, 
But I just can't see.

Totally lost my direction.
When I look in the mirror.
I see there is no reflection.

Where is the true me, 
Why can't I find it.
Where could I be.

Praying for a sign 
Hoping for a miracle, 
Just to get what is mine.

Will I ever find the answer, 
Can I be myself, 
Or is this some kind of cancer. 

Touched with such a closeness
That could be called caress
Touched with many meanings
That could become, I guess
The promise of a life beyond
The life it is that passed
Touched with such a closeness
But do I answer 'yes'

His warm glance
wrapped like an angora shawl, 
Took the chill away

Touch me with Love
Love me like Shakespeare
write me down deep 
within your heart 
let me be all you see baby
dance with me in the coldest rain
take away all my pains 
of yesterday's nightmares 
kiss me with true passion, 
Touch me 
like you had never touched another
give me all your sweet delights
give me the shooting stars of your dreams
love is the true strength
of you and me 
Let me be your one and only
let me your true desires 
don't ever let go of the fire
speak to me like a true poet
dance with me in all your fantasy
touch me with a kiss deep within 
Let your love always be true
no matter how old we get 
old age is a beautiful thing
Let your love be all I need
let your words be like silk to my heart
let this love last forever.


let me feel your body quicken
a sensual journey we will make
to explore each other’s inner curves
and all our outer planes

make our senses come alive with it
we’ll breathe each other in

so touch me, wake me, take me, 
make me cry with sweet desire
show me why I was made woman
make me scream with skin on fire

let me taste you deeply, fully, 
and set your soul ablaze
I want you, need you, have to see
the passion in your face

touch me, let me feel you
fill me up and set us free
to soar to heights we’ve never been
and again, may never see

I ache to feel your heartbeat
echoing above my own
as love explodes, imploding
our two bodies into one. 

Do you know how I feel when you touch my heart
Can you hear me cry inside at your silent embrace
Do you see the fear I keep hidden away
Can you feel the pain I never show
I can't help but smile when you touch my heart
You can't know the warmth it brings me
I can't bring myself to share the love
You can't see the hope in my soul
If only I too touch your heart
I only try to ease your fears
If only I could help as much
I only wish I were as true
Do you know you touch my heart
I love you being in my life
Do you feel the way I do
Do you know you touch my heart.

Hope abides 
when another day 
offers another chance
and joy is still possible. 

Heart like a harp
its strings made of soft strings
strings very fragile
but very responding
when the air of joy
just breezes across
wind of beauty
just passes cross
Joy-listen it is the music of happiness.

No lyrics
no script or human language
joy has no words to say
joy when full speaks not in letters
but in crazy acts and mad laughters
it has no smell, yet it is full of fragrance
it has no taste, yet it's aroma smells of youth
in the joy of being joy
all known senses shuts up
and silence hugs with symphonies rich.

When in full length the joy enters 
from a single note as it reaches the full orchestra
you are nothing, but reduced to a nascent straw
you can sniff the new born baby smell
virgin beauties vagabonds 
and airy visions aloud tell
life is complete, when you forget self
Yes, the moment of bliss is an Ironic kill
drowned in the waters of joy
intoxicated with the drug of life
you are gone, to ashes, no, just simply you are gone
no vapours, no remnants, no left overs, no phoenix fantasies
you are sucked by the imminent transformation
you are suddenly the ocean of joy
then who are you the silliest idiotic quest
when all senses are overwhelmed with feelings fertile
you wish you could hide the body into an unseen hole
and keep on laughing till you burst like a ballooning ball
Really, joy eats you up, swallows you, gluttons you, 
in a split second the ego is lifted up
vanities are unbuttoned
obsessions, prejudices, attachments unlaced
bathed by lovely hands of light heartedness
like a Cabaret dancer you are naked
no more bonds or slave-strings of mind blocked
You are now standing fully bare
enjoying the moment, just inhaling the joy of being. 

Like the hug
of a passionate kid
like the jump of pet dog
fast and instantaneous
before you could think
touch of purity happens
no, not when you could visualize its arrival it comes

like a new born's presence
purity like holy glow
cleanses your inner self
with a feeling of prayer
you mentally kneel down
and give up everything else
but the tinge of inner nicety.

like a wandering butterfly
landing upon the hand
fluttering so softly
butter, velvet, snow, buds purity
like a cat slowly it enters the heart's room
without any noise and disturbing none
but gives you every sense of security you hankered after.

The sky, the ocean, the earth and soil, the fire and the air
all elements of nature cleansing the mind and refreshes your nature
kindness and love and compassion and empathy
all shelters you in their clasp of purest embrace
Purity, thy name so sweet, my soap of heart. 

When your inner eye is opened, 
you see god, not in idol shapes, 
but deep within you can feel
the beauty of life like a small baby
clapping its hands on seeing the huge elephant's 
feet huge and trumpet curved, stepping upon its belly
unaware of dangers potent, you are always happy
when purity revisits your life after the infancy
when you wash your sins paying by pain after pain
and stand by truth and truthfulness, your only gain
is feeling the touch of energy like a Bournvita or Horlicks
running through the brain's most intimate sensitivity links
innocence then is oil, the flicker of light makes you go down
in fours, you become modesty international, no thoughts, just feel nice. 

Ice is melting from the eyes of grey sky
Caressing the raw flesh over my frail chest
This rain has made me decree
Without any fear of being mistaken
By the juvenile minds and budding hearts
"Like the touch of rain she was"



He would say 'touch wood'
When he was optimistic, expected something good
The idea was to avoid the opposite bad
And not to let life turn untoward

The habit grew chronic
His movements became comic
He would look around for actual wood
Every time his lips whispered 'touch wood'

So that he could fast touch
Anything wooden in his reach
Be that a table or a desk
Or even a road-side oak

Panic became his companion
Helter-skelter he ran
With innumerable 'touch woods'
To countless trees in the woods

But, alas, forgot to mouth his chant
A few hours later he died
Of heart-attack the doctor certified

Well, he didn't know that he ended
No 'touch wood' was therefore in order
Death to him was not something that ‘happened'
Not an experience, so no further panic and shudder
 
The world he died in had him found
Lying dead, for no mantra it did utter
To it, his death was something that happened
So, that was also very much in order


We, unaccustomed to courage
exiles from delight
live coiled in shells of loneliness
until love leaves its high holy temple
and comes into our sight
to liberate us into life.

Love arrives
and in its train come ecstasies
old memories of pleasure
ancient histories of pain.
Yet if we are bold,
love strikes away the chains of fear
from our souls.

We are weaned from our timidity
In the flush of love's light
we dare be brave
And suddenly we see
that love costs all we are
and will ever be.
Yet it is only love
which sets us free. 

The landscape with its trees, spring and hills is touched by the sun, 
Only for my eyes to savour that kindhearted splendour.
Pleasure given from it is cool with awe for my brain to run

Though the spectacle of it to grasp a bundle of fun.
And so much has come from the sun’s rays to inser colour
Fair in the landscape for its trees, spring and hills to dance on.

Adhering to unwind at some stage in darkness is gone.
Radiance in form of galvanization they harbour
For their relish, sparkle and harmony to come as one, 

They find comfort gratifying in accretion of huge ton.
Now the sun monumental by far in its endeavour, 
Has seen to its touch; the landscape covered by mirth is done. 

On the hard cold floor I lay awake and pray
If I could only find you deep in my mind
I search for that one sign, that you are near me
Listening to all of my innermost thoughts

It is not funny how I don't smile anymore
My laughter has been ripped, torn
With the one joy I had how can I find closure? 
I try hard to move forward

How can I explain anguish inside of me
Without a list, why I need to be content? 
Content with the worlds foot on my neck, no love
Dreaming dreams that are never reached, there's no love
The love that once consoled me, I can not touch

Desert flowers grow in the wild
There's no rain to quench their thirst
It's like a child's smile when doing wrong
And love pours out with a burst

I will never accept this is all there is
When inside of me I have so much to give
You are my sanctuary, I can go and hide
For so long the pain I fought, you take and heal
The pathway to truth, the real me, is revealed

I listen to all the sad songs on the radio
Now all the lyrics I know
I understand them so much more than yesterday
The meaning touches that way

Take what is wrong and make better what is right
Reaching out with my being,  touching the divine
Knowing there is something inside, no doubt
Walking the walk that leads somewhere, there's no doubt
All the doubt has left me lying awake on the floor

Desert flowers grow in the wild
There's no rain to quench their thirst
It's like a child's smile when doing wrong
And love pours out with a burst


I've never believed in tough love
I've always said it's something I couldn't do
But I've realize that I must do it
If I truly want to help you

I know this means not a single word I can utter 
Nor even a hello
All I can do is be silent
Even though I miss you so

I ask myself everyday
How anyone could choose darkness
Over our light

But worst than that is the reality that your out there
In this ticking time bomb of a world
Trust me
You don't want to be the one holding the grenade
At the end of this fight

I want you to come back
I want you to experience the real life
I don't want you to find out the hard way
That darkness eventually offers nothing but pain
Pain so sharp it feels like you've been pierced by a knife

But I can't make you realize that
I can't save your life
Only HE can do that
Only YOU can do whats right

Maybe someday, some how
You'll get that shove you need
But until then
No matter how hard it maybe
Tough love is all I can give you
And all you will receive


Tough times never last
So don't let mope to cast
The spell of grey and blue
'Cause it's very bad for you
And always remember my dear
That life is not only pain's layer
Troubles do come, but they return
Giving happiness its turn
So stick to hope and hold 'em
And with prayers each day hem
Your life's rough and uneven edge
And then let your luck judge
what should be given to you
Inreturn of the gray and blue
Whether tough time again
Or should it return you fain? ? ? 

Exploring the desert, valleys
high hills and mountains
with an expedition to cross
seas and oceans,  pierced
all stars and planets
landed on the surface of sun
embrassed all good and evil
of the creation, I tormented
my divine soul to elude
from all sufferings of life

My endeavour could all be possible
except the ego of all creation
with which all are survived
dispensing them from supreme abode
and height of supreme consciousness
and letting to live under pride
of its own species; disallowing modesty
and sublimity for a perfect life.

I applied my several attempt
kept my mouth shut for all purpose
to bring modesty in my soul
but it stumbled somewhere on any reason
compelled me to lead the worldly life.

O' my Master of my all reasons
please get me to the supreme abode
where I am more and more humbled
with full modesty of supreme creation
my life be dedicated for supreme thought
and I bow my head before the supreme bliss. 



Fill your mind with positive words
And start your journey of life
Let this life unfold itself
In ways that are clear that survive

And learn to handle trouble and pain
And move towards your goal
For many unknown images will appear
In this life's deep dug hole

But remember that nature is a healer
That helps us all through time
And then one by one we all learn
To sing same tune and rhyme

And save yourself in getting into
The endless loop of thoughts today
For it'll trap your thought and mind
And will hide your vivid way

Just know that life is a real test
That we all take one by one dear
And move towards unknown goals
To finally  reach its end layer

So don't hide your fear or pain
Just pour it out all today
And find your real goal of life
With positive things in the way. 

Who understands everything
That is here in the ring
For all our joys and cries
And all our how and whys
Can only be answered by Him
Who loves us with a vim
And only He can fill with joy
The emptiness og our days
And can wipe the pain
And deep shadows of the rain

O tower of light, sad beauty
that magnified necklaces and statues in the sea,
calcareous eye, insignia of the vast waters, cry
of the mourning petrel, tooth of the sea, wife
of the Oceanian wind, O separate rose
from the long stem of the trampled bush
that the depths, converted into archipelago,
O natural star, green diadem,
alone in your lonesome dynasty,
still unattainable, elusive, desolate
like one drop, like one grape, like the sea. 

Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey 
I ache in the places where I used to play 
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on 
I'm just paying my rent every day 
Oh in the Tower of Song


In great dismay you came. 
	'Look! I've been bit! '
'You play with serpents, friend. 
	The charmer charmed.'
Distressed, you cried out, 
	flailing in a fit, 
		till shock set in. 
	At that I grew alarmed.
		I'm scouting trained. 
		My friendship I can prove.
	I lanced your wound 
	and sucked and spat 
	and sucked and spat again, 
	the deadly poison to remove.
I saved your life, 
	so why do I feel fucked? 
And even then I thought, 
	I can't ignore I risk this venom 
		getting in my veins.
And what's in this for me 
	for all my pains? 
And haven't we done 
	just this thing before? 
I watch you limping back 
	to find that snake.
How often must we make 
	the same mistake




	With love, I trace
the contours
of your heart

to touch the light
that emanates from it
flaming with desire

stroking its warmth
it wills me higher
to the space

filled with elevated ecstasy
beyond my most untamed scope. 

Trace the tracker 
installed in human brain.
When people  steal or kill, 
get bribes  or cut  teller machines, 
alerts, the police will receive
and soon they will be at their heels.
If it is possible from a stolen cell phone, 
why isn’t from our headphone

Tracks in the Sand

I saw tracks in the sand
Of a lonely walker.
He then turned left
In the sand.

I ran towards him
Leaving my tracks in the sand
And asked him 
Why he was alone.

He looked at me
Then smiled.
He said since I was walking next to him
He was not a lonely walker anymore. 

His footsteps moved, 
Next to the sparrow's bird's feet.
His friend backed up one, 
Their footsteps became one.


This bird knew not, 
It was being studied, 
So curiously by the man.


The man knew not either, 
He was being studied, 
So curiously by the bird.



So neither of them worried. 

I will teach you my townspeople
how to perform a funeral
for you have it over a troop
of artists-
unless one should scour the world-
you have the ground sense necessary.

See! the hearse leads.
I begin with a design for a hearse.
nor white either - and not polished!
Let it be whethered - like a farm wagon -
with gilt wheels (this could be
applied fresh at small expense)
or no wheels at all:
a rough dray to drag over the ground.

Knock the glass out!
For what purpose? Is it for the dead
to look out or for us to see
the flowers or the lack of them -
or what?
To keep the rain and snow from him?
He will have a heavier rain soon:
pebbles and dirt and what not.
Let there be no glass -
and no upholstery, phew!
and no little brass rollers
and small easy wheels on the bottom -
my townspeople, what are you thinking of?
A rough plain hearse then
with gilt wheels and no top at all.
On this the coffin lies
by its own weight.

No wreathes please-
especially no hot house flowers.
Some common memento is better,
something he prized and is known by:
his old clothes - a few books perhaps -
how we are about these things
my townspeople -
something will be found - anything
even flowers if he had come to that.
So much for the hearse.

For heaven's sake though see to the driver!
Take off the silk hat! In fact
that's no place at all for him -
up there unceremoniously
dragging our friend out to his own dignity!
Bring him down - bring him down!
Low and inconspicuous! I'd not have him ride
on the wagon at all - damn him! -
the undertaker's understrapper!
Let him hold the reins
and walk at the side
and inconspicuously too!


Then briefly as to yourselves:
Walk behind - as they do in France,
seventh class, or if you ride
Hell take curtains! Go with some show
of inconvenience; sit openly -
to the weather as to grief.
Or do you think you can shut grief in?
What - from us? We who have perhaps
nothing to lose? Share with us
share with us - it will be money
in your pockets.
Go now
I think you are ready. 


Rows and rows of tiny heels
teetered in pairs 
on the dolls house shelves.
So she was a collector.

She was not what I expected.
Dressing gowned and ugly
(a botched face job, perhaps?)  
with a small dog squirming under her arm.


The curtains were drawn.
The television flickered
in the summer heat.
She didn't turn it off.

An exercise machine
sat unwrapped by the coffee table.
'I must lose weight -
but with my bladder condition? '

I showed her the boots
worn once for my son's wedding
They were crimson – Italian suede.
'I'll take $for them'.

'The photos don't do them justice.
They're gorgeous - perfect.' 
Her voice trembled as she 
forced a fat foot into the high arch.


'They're too bloody small! 
I knew they would be.
It's this bloody weight.
Can't seem to shift it.'

Where would she wear them, I wondered -
these four inch pedestals of podalic grace? 
Then I noticed the long fake nails
that sprouted from her hands. 


holding her in the afterglow
where words were 
never really needed, 
he was fond of whispering
that it was all her

then he would smile and add
that he merely 
followed her lead

if only heaven would allow her
one wish, 
one clear and stunning wish, 
she would use that wish 
to trade places 
just one time 
when they made love

then she could know 
what it feels like 
to be him
and he could experience
in that one time
the joy it was to be her

and he would see, first hand, 
why she always answered 
that it was all him


More to find

Buck up cheerfully
As mind is deeply
Involved in skirmishes
With fight to finishes

Nothing useful comes
But only inflames
Already troubled mind
For only ashes to find

So give no room’
And give up soon
Stand with alternative go
And successfully blow

The wind shall enter
And cater
Your craziness
To steer the course

So entertain
And maintain
Stable mind
With lot more to find


Ah green, I love my green.
It's the traffic light's nicest scene.
Green is a traffic dream.


You can always keep driving, driving, driving.
And you can keep going in life, whatever you're doing, 
Your favorite project, your favorite dream.


And orange traffic light, 
In my life, I've had to a slow down when I was skiing, 
A slow down of whatever I was doing.

And oh red light.
I had to stop being in so much strife.
I had to stop my bad habits. 

I dream of me and you, 
Lost in the world, 
Just waiting to find each other, 
And embrace in a true love.


Seeking and searching, waiting for you.
Standing in place, letting the world pass me by.
Looking into the dark night, into the city streets.
My gaze flashes from neon to neon, lighting up the world.

I look at the people, heads down, hearts broken.
Could one of you be my true love, 
Happiness in despair, Joy in agony? 

Then I glance across the cars that swiftly pass by.
Your sitting, staring into me, piercing my heart, 
Like a hook in a fish, freely swimming away to death.

Our eyes locked, only phased by the traffic in between.
You reach out your hand, telling me to come closer.
I take my first step, not looking behind, or up ahead.
I'm only focused on you my joy and delight.

Walking to you I hear the muted sounds, 
Suddenly scream, a blaring horn, the crackle of bones beneath me.
The siren song is the only music in my head.
I'll never forget the pain in your face, 
And when they said I was lost, you cried and cried.

Looking down at the city lights, 
Into the crowds of loneliness; 
I see a girl I knew before, 
But different than the last time I saw her, 

Eyes red from tears, cuts on her hand and wrists.
I walked up beside her, no sound I made.
She stopped at a familiar intersection of which I knew all too well.


Suddenly her fears numbed, I held her hand, 
And slowly we walked into the highway of her death.
The car was moving fast enough, she caught the blow, 
And was through into the air.
She landed with a deathly crunch on the ground.

I looked beside me, and she was there smiling and crying too.
I took her hand and we passed through the cars, 
And as they passed us by, I knew, 
I was with her again.


The beloved Prophet was arrested on trumped-up
charges as had happened several times before.
This was to be the last time. An angry mob was about
to descend upon Carthage jail with muskets loaded.
Several years before, when he was a young man, 
he had gone to a private place and prayed. 

News of that traveled rapidly, and hatred
and opposition increased unbelievably fast. 
Ministers of the day had stirred up opposition
and ridicule, saying "The heavens are closed, "
and "It's the work of the devil" and demanded
of his neighbors to have nothing to do with him.

Now, in jail, he recalled past events. His followers
In Missouri had been driven out of their homes
In the dead of winter after broken promises
by Governor Dunklin. Their homes and crops
were burned. Dunklin was replaced by Governor
Boggs who issued "Proclamation Extermination

"
 
The Prophet had told his people in Illinois
"There's a Judas in our midst

" His bodyguard
had to flee for his life. On his return he told
the names of five traitors among them.
Those apostates were the ones making accusations
against the Prophet for crimes that they themselves
had committed. Every effort made to squelch the lies
against him was met with violence and hatred. 

Governor Ford had broken his promise to give him
protection as he gave himself up. Furthermore, 
Ford had threatened to destroy all of his followers
if he wasn't at Carthage jail by M the next morning.
"-I go as a lamb to a slaughter-I have a conscience

men were in the jail cell. They heard a gunshot, 
then a mob of more than white men with faces
painted black were seen going around the corner
of the jail. Moments later the guards were pushed
aside. Bullets whizzed in all directions.

A ball was fired through the jail door keyhole
and muskets blazed inside the room.
The Prophet and his brother were killed.
One was Injured by five balls, but survived.
One was not hit as the Prophet had said.

The sinners had killed the Prophet's body.
They had tried to get him to recant his testimony, 
but he never denied it. It was sealed by his blood. 


It shall be tragic blow
When you leave me and go 
I shall watch it calmly 
But shall not resist firmly 

I have no option
But to miss and end relation
That shall not be easy
As it has gone so deep already 

You are not deserter
Or cheater
But simple human who knows how to care
Acts not in own interest to look fair 

Why good people should be picked early? 
And sent to death's jaw readily
I have choked throat
On calm water I deadly float

I think no more
But wish to pray some more
Good people should never be tortured
But taken care of and offered


King of kings and most beloved star Pop, 
We lost forever a man in you and high hope, 
It was not easy for black to walk on rope, 
You lost no courage and preferred slope, 

For rising high, you paid so dearly, 
Whites were fooled so cleverly, 
Rose to the top at an early age, 
Bonded music free from closed cage, 

Transformation from black to complete white, 
Hard work from morning day till late night, 
Nothing was coming to you by way of right, 
You chose to face and offered a fight, 

Daily shows with improvement in music, 
Money returns plenty but killed magic, 
Fighting with odds and struggle heroic, 
Fame, prestige, name all proved toxic, 

Hours and hours you danced on floor, 
Ships aground and never reached shore, 
Fame and money blinded with rage, 
Global name with golden ink on page, 

World and humanity benefited a lot, 
Always in limelight and news spot, 
Surrounded by celebrities and rich, 
Going away and away from Poor’s reach, 

Your body could stand no more strain, 
It was not less than slain, 
World did not bother and only blamed, 
Door shut and avenues slammed, 

You remained only body of corpse, 
Skin disappeared with body collapse, 
No food but drugs and only injections, 
You lay on bed without any projection, 

World may remember you as global artist, 
Laying wreath and floral tribute insist, 
Still it is mystery and doubts persist, 
World at large must fear and desist, 

His soul will hound us for time to come, 
It is for sure no other soul will descend and become, 
Earnestly pray for his soul to rest in peace, 
Let him sing his songs and enjoy at ease


All devil as I am-a damned wretch,
A hardened, stubborn, unrepenting villain,
Still my heart melts at human wretchedness;
And with sincere but unavailing sighs
I view the helpless children of distress:
With tears indignant I behold the oppressor
Rejoicing in the honest man's destruction,
Whose unsubmitting heart was all his crime. -
Ev'n you, ye hapless crew! I pity you;
Ye, whom the seeming good think sin to pity;
Ye poor, despised, abandoned vagabonds,
Whom Vice, as usual, has turn'd o'er to ruin.
Oh! but for friends and interposing Heaven,
I had been driven forth like you forlorn,
The most detested, worthless wretch among you!
With talents passing most of my compeers,
Which I in just proportion have abused-
As far surpassing other common villains
As Thou in natural parts has given me more. 


Tragic Moment

That tragic moment
That went on and on
Didn't let him rest
From night to dawn.

Those flashes of moments gone by, 
Where the truth didn't lie.
The moments of death
From man to man.

These moments did not lie.
They were tragic. 
Mankind learned about war
By and by. 


He is years, 
Trailakya is his name
Lives in a remote village, 
Without any fame.
Passed his childhood there, 
Like the other boys.
Playing with clay and mud, 
With sorrows and joys.
He is a common man, 
Like the grass.
Neither gold nor diamond
But like brass.

I like to see it lap the miles,
And lick the valleys up,
And stop to feed itself at tanks;
And then, prodigious, step 

Around a pile of mountains,
And, supercilious, peer
In shanties by the sides of roads;
And then a quarry pare 

To fit its sides, and crawl between,
Complaining all the while
In horrid, hooting stanza;
Then chase itself down the hill 

And neigh like Boanerges;
Then, punctual as a star,
Stop - docile and omnipotent -
At its own stable door. 


A train of flowers, 
A train with seats, 
A train of people, 
Standing in a row.

I love trains of any kind.
Their shape is what I like.
Trains of toy trains are beautiful, 
And I just like trains.

A train of roses, 
A train of vases, 
A train of rain.
All is beautiful. 


After rain, through afterglow, the unfolding fan
of railway landscape sidled onthe pivot
of a larger arc into the green of evening;
I remembered that noon I saw a gradual bud
still white; though dead in its warm bloom;
always the enemy is the foe at home.
And I wondered what surgery could recover
our lost, long stride of indolence and leisure
which is labor in reverse; what physic recall the smile
not of lips, but of eyes as of the sea bemused.
We, when we disperse from common sleep to several
tasks, we gather to despair; we, who assembled
once for hopes from common toil to dreams
or sickish and hurting or triumphal rapture;
always our enemy is our foe at home.
We, deafened with far scattered city rattles
to the hubbub of forest birds (never having
'had time' to grieve or to hear through vivid sleep
the sea knock on its cracked and hollow stones)
so that the stars, almost, and birds comply,
and the garden-wet; the trees retire; We are
a scared patrol, fearing the guns behind;
always the enemy is the foe at home.
What wonder that we fear our own eyes' look
and fidget to be at home alone, and pitifully
put of age by some change in brushing the hair
and stumble to our ends like smothered runners at their tape;
We follow our shreds of fame into an ambush.
Then (as while the stars herd to the great trough
the blind, in the always-only-outward of their dismantled
archways, awake at the smell of warmed stone
or the sound of reeds, lifting from the dim
into the segment of green dawn) always
our enemy is our foe at home, more
certainly than through spoken words or from grief-
twisted writing on paper, unblotted by tears
the thought came:
There is no physic
for the world's ill, nor surgery; it must
(hot smell of tar on wet salt air)
burn in fever forever, an incense pierced
with arrows, whose name is Love and another name
Rebellion (the twinge, the gulf, split seconds,
the very raindrops, render, and instancy
of Love).
All Poetry to this not-to-be-looked-upon sun
of Passion is the moon's cupped light; all
Politics to this moon, a moon's reflected
cupped light, like the moon of Rome, after
the deep well of Grecian light sank low;
always the enemy is the foe at home.
But these three are friends whose arms twine
without words; as, in still air,
the great grove leans to wind, past and to come. 


The train that sped around the world, 
Kept up with the spin of the globe, 
Never moving one inch forward or back.
It just kept up high velocity, 
Around the earth's vicinity.

We all wondered why it went this way, 
But knowing how things go, 
The train only would know, 
For it's life's mission may be to have fun, 
Or just show mankind how technology can be done. 


Slow down dear husband, 
It's a rail-road crossing.
We might be hit by a train! 

No need dear wife, 
The train has already gone by.
My superior brain tells me why.

But how do you know, 
Did you see it go by? 
Can you hear it, tell me why.


It's simple dear, 
No need to look or listen.
I can see its tracks. 

It was most challenging period
That nobody could avoid
The initial training was so hard
But it was really worth to look forward

The army training teaches us a lot
Every inch is resolutely fought 
There is no scope for carelessness
The firmness reflects clearly on face 

The day starts with morning health run
It looks as if taking part in fun game 
Each cadet is in sport shot
The fresh air is inhaled and health is kept in order


The training is really tough
The cadet is not allowed to remain smooth
He is trained like toughest animal
Ready to carry load with fail

No country can afford to be lenient
On defense preparedness at present
The youth of today have to be trained 
So the sanctity of border is always maintained

I remember the olden days
What a beautiful way to stay! 
in one barrack with single mission
same food, same thought with no confusion


Trains that shake the ground
Rip my August dreams 
I sip on the sound
Of sirens' sour cream
Thus, another sleepless night
I guess that's to be expected
Because this city's just not right


And I lay unprotected Traitors of today occupy imminent position
Well orchestrated songs in praise for composition
Establishment of personal rule over millions of people
Can not look forward for anything good and are unable


What have they to do for their own country? 
Rob, steal, cut backs and commission in form of money? 
Add vows to already worsened poverty? 
Can any one tell us when this will end misery? 

I have all praise and kudos for their divine talent
We have tears in eyes but nothing more to lament
What else do they deserve to invite us for comment? 
We prefer to be mere spectator and be silent

In ancient time people were hanged to death
For crimes, murders and ill gotten wealth
Today it is considered as an adorable art
Academicians, politicians present themselves as smart 

Where is the national interest and security? 
How can one claim to be powerful and mighty? 
When house is full of defaulters and selfish? 
Searching for troubled water to catch the fishes

Why are we facing such national scene? 
Such a low lever acts were never witnessed or seen? 
How come national wealth is deposited in foreign banks? 
How come National security weakened and remains with unsecured flank? 


I am no crocodile to shed the tears
I am immune and have no fears
I have power and money to manage the show
I can reign supreme and in full readiness to grow


O, countrymen wake up and prepare for national funeral
Decorate with honor and shields upon their arrival
They are our heroes to barter and take away the freedom
Such things may never appear to witness seldom

I feel pity upon those who foolishly laid down their lives
Curse on those parents who push their children and believe
"The motherland is precious than heaven" and come forward
Time has come now to think and look back ward

Where are those golden days when promises were kept? 
Words were honored and nights were spent without being slept? 
The national interest ruled supreme in the mind and at heart
Where from to pick thread now and with open mind to restart? 

I do not blame the culture or present set up
We have degraded ourselves and deserve to be shut up
We can see the scoundrels flourish with position and wealth
Who bother’s about country men and its deteriorating health? 

I wish to born in land again and again
Where Mafias, traitors, and squanders reign
The borders are left open to venture at will
Thousands of innocents to wait for terrorists to come and kill


Some are speakers, some writers.
Some are workers, some leaders.
No one is four in one.
Choose, accordingly, the profession.







The rockets trajectory, 
Made me happy. 
It's rocket boosters, 
Sinking down to ground.


The rocket's trajectory, 
Made me wonder, 
How it's break from gravity, 
Was what it needed.


It seemed to me, 
A marvel in the sky.
While I stared at it, 
It made me cry. 


Primitive shadows dancing on the edges of the night
I sojourn underneath broken skies of fallen spheres
Where wretched pinions of vengeful eyed scavengers take flight
Fallen birds from disenchanted constellations yonder nigh
Beckons migrating souls wandering thru the sands of Discordia
Man is a slave, the mind is a god imprisoned, encrypted on the ancient tablets of Primordia.

Nemesis descend upon primitive clay at twilights' last gleam
Aeons spirals into final moments through the portals of calculated eternity into oblivious awakening 
I followed the footprints of blindfolded sculptures n heard the music of timeless redemption break the spell of suspended animation
Sacred songs no longer rides the thin air, despair steals the joys of new years, behold the clouds of ancient Primordia hurled down alas without bridle, behold old Discordias' final scene

Barefoot pilgrims bled in their soles treading upon the broken pieces of the hour glass scattered thru the miry sands of time
Wild karma beckons from behind
Stalking the unbeliever, trapped inside an iron globe, far from where peace is. 


The moon and the stars share the sky's peace, 
While the sun after roaming now sleeps.
Calm as mist silver, the night appeals
In a kind crawling across the streets.
Underneath these fifty four score trees, 
I walk 'midst their calmness my heart seeks.
My soul dwells upon the nature's greens, 
Edible with taste of hush that creams.
My heart airy running as wind speeds.

To joy's brink, my essence, penchant leads, 
Like gazelle feathered across with beams.
In this park, the beechen frames are scenes
Of serenity, like mountains' peaks
On the orb, my essence tender sees.
Nature in a way as a guardian treats
One with cloud-like harmony one feels.
Of the walk bliss I 'am enjoying keeps, 
Lit my essence tender to increase. 




In silenced sleepless nights
They draw me close to them, 
Through visionary lands and sights
Of unfulfilled needs, the worldly fame, 

Towards a realm without immorality
The immortality of kindness, 
The poignant poise of sympathy
Lives be in them, placidness.

Airy lands of the skies
The soundless voice of paradise, 
The symbol peace of serenity
Let it be released - Tranquility. 

Tranquility is the romance of nature
where seed fertile, sprouts
reproduce its genetic growth
to endless sequence


The flower in the glass peanut bottle formerly in the
kitchen crooked to take a place in the light, 
the closet door opened, because I used it before, it
kindly stayed open waiting for me, its owner.

I began to feel my misery in pallet on floor, listening
to music, my misery, that's why I want to sing.
The room closed down on me, I expected the presence 
of the Creator, I saw my gray painted walls and
ceiling, they contained my room, they contained
me
as the sky contained my garden,
I opened my door


The rambler vine climbed up the cottage post,
the leaves in the night still where the day had placed
them, the animal heads of the flowers where they had 
arisen
to think at the sun


Can I bring back the words? Will thought of 
transcription haze my mental open eye?
The kindly search for growth, the gracious de-
sire to exist of the flowers, my near ecstasy at existing
among them
The privilege to witness my existence-you too
must seek the sun.


My books piled up before me for my use
waiting in space where I placed them, they
haven't disappeared, time's left its remnants and qual-
ities for me to use--my words piled up, my texts, my 
manuscripts, my loves.
I had a moment of clarity, saw the feeling in
the heart of things, walked out to the garden crying.
Saw the red blossoms in the night light, sun's 
gone, they had all grown, in a moment, and were wait-
ing stopped in time for the day sun to come and give
them. 
Flowers which as in a dream at sunset I watered
faithfully not knowing how much I loved them.
I am so lonely in my glory--except they too out
there--I looked up--those red bush blossoms beckon-
ing and peering in the window waiting in the blind love,
their leaves too have hope and are upturned top flat
to the sky to receive--all creation open to receive--the 
flat earth itself.


The music descends, as does the tall bending 
stalk of the heavy blossom, because it has to, to stay
alive, to continue to the last drop of joy.
The world knows the love that's in its breast as
in the flower, the suffering lonely world.
The Father is merciful.

The light socket is crudely attached to the ceil-
ing, after the house was built, to receive a plug which
sticks in it alright, and serves my phonograph now.


The closet door is open for me, where I left it,
since I left it open, it has graciously stayed open.
The kitchen has no door, the hole there will 
admit me should I wish to enter the kitchen.
I remember when I first got laid

graciously took my cherry, I sat on the docks of 
Provincetown, age  joyful, elevated in hope with the
Father, the door to the womb was
open to admit me
if I wished to enter.


There are unused electricity plugs all over my
house if I ever needed them.
The kitchen window is open, to admit air. 
The telephone--sad to relate--sits on the
floor--I haven't had the money to get it connected--

I want people to bow when they see me and say
he is gifted with poetry, he has seen the presence of
the Creator
And the Creator gave me a shot of his presence
to gratify my wish, so as not to cheat me of my yearning
for him. 


Transfer of information is the base
Of evolutionary theory.
It takes place when two gametes meet and join
To form a zygote by passing their genes.
That is why a baby is the copy
Of its parents in behaviors 
Attitudes and instinctual actions, 
Duly improved by each generation
From the natural selection.




They were talking to him about resurrection, about law,
about the suffering ahead.
They were talking as if to remind him who he was and
who they were. He was not
Like his three friends watching a little way off, not like
the crowd
At the foot of the hill. A gray-green thunderhead massed
from the sea
talking
About how the body, broken or burned, could live again,
remade.
Only the fiery text of the thunderhead could explain it.
And they were talking
About pain and the need for judgement and how he would
make himself
A law of pain, both its spirit and its letter in his own flesh,
and then break it,
That is, transcend it. His clothes flared like magnesium,
as they talked. 


Silence prevails all around, it's the night! 
I want to break free and make everyone listen..
Swimming in the darkest cloud of loneliness, 
The nomadic mind turns eccentric at this hour
Wants to tear the solitude apart
And looks for some crazy thoughts to express.


Hey there! Can you see? 
The period of pitch darkness shadowing us? 
Enshrouding the brightest of times? 
We stand still and forget the old melodious chimes..

But all is not lost! 
The soulful music playing inside my lonely heart
Wants all of us to make a fresh start.
Listen once again! 
The magical symphony mesmerises all over, 
Covering all the pearls of tears
Which emerged out of the deepest sorrow..
Searching thereby for a colourful tomorrow.


Wishes come alive to plunge
Into the maddening stream of glee, 
The inner soul looks to flee
And reach the morning hours, 
Announcing the advent of the rising Sun! 
And dances with eternal joy
Celebrating the feel of metamorphosis, 
Swaying to the moments of trance.

Listen! There goes the bell, started to toll, 
Breaking the silent spree, 
Our hands are up, the moment has set us free..
We come to the end of the murky times..
Watery eyes dried up and shining, 
Seeing the gleams of the day..
And it's light again all the way, 

Making us take the oath, to live the beautiful life..
Once more.


When start feeling unwise
Lose the mental capacity 
And forget the existence of almighty

Yes sometimes you may have defeatist tendencies
But that must come out and get released
No one should hold it for longer time
It may push you to brink sometimes

Love the nature and pick new leaf
Our life is short and brief
No can live with hatred
If so, then take him as dead

There is place for transformation
From nothing to self elevation
We are human being 
There is room for change to bring 

Who is real person? 
The man who rectifies mistakes with internal decision
There is no time to consider it as sin
Nothing must remain permanent or be seen 

Start the life from stretch
Pick the love and detach 
The hatred has no place
Life is nothing but meaningful chase


I am out in a journey, on a long march
Aimless and wandering, I walked out 
Mid-way, time took a toll and the goal lost its way
None stood as a beacon, the way looked endless.


I forgot what the journey was worth
I was lost in a bog of illusions, as if I was blind
The Holy Spirit mocked me, worldly pleasures circled me
I was in a hunt for the ephemeral treasures.

I walked on, peace was never mine, 
Slowly I was in a prison-house of pleasures
Wisdom dawned at last, a flash of epiphany
I was transformed, now the goal was eternal peace

For long I was in an accursed maze
I was bewildered, in mercy of hate and pleasures 
The supreme goal of peace now is dimly visible
I am in the end of journey, light of peace in my hand. 

I adopt skills, customs and fashions
Which all the people I think high adopt 
To elevate myself to their level.
Dull cultures dissolve in brighter ones.




To your spirit be steadfast
In the endeavour
Of your potency to cast
The wondrous humour
As of your psyche to blast
Your place with colour
Putting your dreams to life. Vast
At your view, splendour
That sets like a royal mast
Conferred with honour.
To you, pride has come at last
For you to harbour. 


I can see clearly
the world is changing
drifting rearranging
there is only one answer
that is humanity
being humane
in the first place
with dignity and grace
do not corner
each other
into misery!

Cowered, I live unto thee
Prostrate in submission to the Almighty
Time is transient as they walk in envy
For all these I say, is fitted to a "T"
To create a stir, a place within me
Oh, how foolish the world is
With its fumble and tumble
As one hurdles temper amidst the trouble
But what is beauty to a scar
That live in testament of this transient time
Echoing and calling to remember
This hungry lips to shiver
We did it
.. 

A woman I have never seen before
Steps from the darkness of her town-house door
At just that crux of time when she is made
So beautiful that she or time must fade.

What use to claim that as she tugs her gloves
A phantom heraldry of all the loves
Blares from the lintel? That the staggered sun
Forgets, in his confusion, how to run?

Still, nothing changes as her perfect feet
Click down the walk that issues in the street,
Leaving the stations of her body there
Like whips that map the countries of the air. 


Strange that the self’s continuum should outlast 
The Virgin, Aphrodite, and the Mourning Mother, 
All loves and griefs, successive deities 
That hold their kingdom in the human breast. 
Abandoned by the gods, woman with an ageing body 
That half remembers the Annunciation 
The passion and the travail and the grief 
That wore the mask of my humanity, 
I marvel at the soul’s indifference. 
For in her theatre the play is done, 
The tears are shed; the actors, the immortals 
In their ceaseless manifestation, elsewhere gone, 
And I who have been Virgin and Aphrodite, 
Wait for the last mummer, dread Persephone 
To dance my dust at last into the tomb. 


First he said:
It is the woman in us
That makes us write-
Let us acknowledge it-
Men would be silent.
We are not men
Therefore we can speak
And be conscious
(of the two sides)
Unbent by the sensual
As befits accuracy.

I then said:
Dare you make this
Your propaganda?

And he answered:
Am I not I-here


Nature withheld Cassandra in the skies
For more adornment a full thousand years;
She took their cream of Beauty's fairest dyes,
And shap'd and tinted her above all Peers:
Meanwhile Love kept her dearly with his wings,
And underneath their shadow fill'd her eyes
With such a richness that the cloudy Kings
Of high Olympus utter'd slavish sighs.
When from the Heavens I saw her first descend
My heart took fire, and only burning pains
They were my pleasures -- they my Life's sad end;
Love pour'd her beauty into my warm veins.  

Thou who dost, best friend, in best things outshine ; 
May thy soul, ever cheerful, ne'er know cares, 
Nor thy life, ever lively, know grey hairs, 
Nor thy hand, ever open, know base holds, 
Nor thy purse, ever plump, know pleats, or folds, 
Nor thy tongue, ever true, know a false thing, 
Nor thy words, ever mild, know quarrelling, 
Nor thy works, ever equal, know disguise, 
Nor thy fame, ever pure, know contumelies, 
Nor thy prayers know low objects, still divine ; 

You say: Where did you find this
It sounds sad, play it again, 
And what does that word mean
I tell you that  I don't know	
As i take off your headphones	
Adagio, adagio






BUT Cytherea, studious to invent
Arts yet untried, upon new counsels bent,
Resolves that Cupid, changed in form and face
To young Ascanius, should assume his place;
Present the maddening gifts, and kindle heat
Of passion at the bosom's inmost seat.
She dreads the treacherous house, the double tongue;
She burns, she frets--by Juno's rancour stung;
The calm of night is powerless to remove
These cares, and thus she speaks to winged Love: 

'O son, my strength, my power! who dost despise
(What, save thyself, none dares through earth and skies)
The giant-quelling bolts of Jove, I flee,
O son, a suppliant to thy deity!
What perils meet Aeneas in his course,
How Juno's hate with unrelenting force
Pursues thy brother--this to thee is known;
And oft-times hast thou made my griefs thine own.
Him now the generous Dido by soft chains
Of bland entreaty at her court detains; 
Junonian hospitalities prepare
Such apt occasion that I dread a snare.
With passion for Aeneas, such strong love
That at my beck, mine only, she shall move.
Hear, and assist;--the father's mandate calls
His young Ascanius to the Tyrian walls;
He comes, my dear delight,--and costliest things
Preserved from fire and flood for presents brings. 
Him will I take, and in close covert keep,
'Mid groves Idalian, lulled to gentle sleep,
Or on Cythera's far-sequestered steep,
That he may neither know what hope is mine,
Nor by his presence traverse the design.
Do thou, but for a single night's brief space,
Dissemble; be that boy in form and face!
And when enraptured Dido shall receive
Thee to her arms, and kisses interweave
With many a fond embrace, while joy runs high, 
And goblets crown the proud festivity,
Instil thy subtle poison, and inspire,
At every touch, an unsuspected fire.'


Love, at the word, before his mother's sight
Puts off his wings, and walks, with proud delight,
Like young Iulus; but the gentlest dews
Of slumber Venus sheds, to circumfuse
The true Ascanius steeped in placid rest;
Then wafts him, cherished on her careful breast,
Through upper air to an Idalian glade, 
Where he on soft 'amaracus' is laid,
With breathing flowers embraced, and fragrant shade.
But Cupid, following cheerily his guide
Achates, with the gifts to Carthage hied;
And, as the hall he entered, there, between
The sharers of her golden couch, was seen
The Trojans, too (Aeneas at their head),
On conches lie, with purple overspread:
Meantime in canisters is heaped the bread, 
Pellucid water for the hands is borne,
And napkins of smooth texture, finely shorn.
Within are fifty handmaids, who prepare,
As they in order stand, the dainty fare;
And fume the household deities with store
Of odorous incense; while a hundred more
Matched with an equal number of like age,
But each of manly sex, a docile page,
Marshal the banquet, giving with due grace
To cup or viand its appointed place. 
The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band,
Their painted couches seek, obedient to command.
They look with wonder on the gifts--they gaze
Upon Iulus, dazzled with the rays
That from his ardent countenance are flung,
And charmed to hear his simulating tongue;
Nor pass unpraised the robe and veil divine,
Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine.

But chiefly Dido, to the coming ill
Devoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill; 
She views the gifts; upon the child then turns
Insatiable looks, and gazing burns.
To ease a father's cheated love he hung
Upon Aeneas, and around him clung;
She fastens on the boy enamoured eyes,
Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!)
Would fill it with his spirit. He, to please
His Acidalian mother, by degrees 
Blots out Sichaeus, studious to remove
The dead, by influx of a living love,
By stealthy entrance of a perilous guest.
Troubling a heart that had been long at rest.

Now when the viands were withdrawn, and ceased
The first division of the splendid feast,
While round a vacant board the chiefs recline,
Huge goblets are brought forth; they crown the wine;
Voices of gladness roll the walls around;
Those gladsome voices from the courts rebound; 
From gilded rafters many a blazing light
Depends, and torches overcome the night.
A bowl of state is offered to her hand:
Then she, as Belus wont, and all the line
From Belus, filled it to the brim with wine;
Silence ensued. 'O Jupiter, whose care
Is hospitable dealing, grant my prayer!
Productive day be this of lasting joy
To Tyrians, and these exiles driven from Troy; 
A day to future generations dear!
Let Bacchus, donor of soul-quick'ning cheer,
Be present; kindly Juno, be thou near!
And, Tyrians, may your choicest favours wait
Upon this hour, the bond to celebrate!'
She spake and shed an offering on the board;
Then sipped the bowl whence she the wine had poured
And gave to Bitias, urging the prompt lord;
He raised the bowl, and took a long deep draught;
Then every chief in turn the beverage quaffed. 

Graced with redundant hair, Iopas sings
The lore of Atlas, to resounding strings,
The labours of the Sun, the lunar wanderings;
When human kind, and brute; what natural powers
Engender lightning, whence are falling showers.
He haunts Arcturus,--that fraternal twain
The glittering Bears,--the Pleiads fraught with rain;
--Why suns in winter, shunning heaven's steep heights
Post seaward,--what impedes the tardy nights.
The learned song from Tyrian hearers draws 
Loud shouts,--the Trojans echo the applause.
--But, lengthening out the night with converse new,
Large draughts of love unhappy Dido drew;
Of Priam asked, of Hector--o'er and o'er--
What arms the son of bright Aurora wore;--
What steeds the car of Diomed could boast;
Among the leaders of the Grecian host.
How looked Achilles, their dread paramount--
'But nay--the fatal wiles, O guest, recount,
Retrace the Grecian cunning from its source, 
Your own grief and your friends?--your wandering course;
For now, till this seventh summer have ye ranged
The sea, or trod the earth, to peace estranged.

'Shshsh, be quiet now
Be a good boy, you‘ve got to try a little harder, that simply wasn’t good enough, to make us proud.  Long for good friends, we realised you have some hidden in your sleeve.  Treat ‘em like brothers and let us reach.  Don’t forget to win first place - won’t you tell me about this race? - and keep that smiling face, at night your teeth will show-  Be quiet now, you’ve got to show some respect to let us dream.  You told me to be telling you "be a good girl", we have a little burden now with your dreams coming true and ours falling apart, falling like a leaf in a new-coming story’s midst.  Don’t rely on other beasts, you all are awful, bear that in mind.  These lips are trembling, of characters in a story you‘ll soon forget.  Don’t forget your manners, it’s all you have, you asked me to lend you clothes for a while, and you asked him to sign for your new I. 

D.  Where will this lead?  Darling, we’re ill, don’t let us down in our brief age, we forgive, can’t you?  Be a good girl; push a little further now, that simply wasn’t strong enough, to bring us back.  We’ll love you, just the way you are, falling leaves rot, young flowers bloom, ignore his heavy breath, ignore his slurpy gloom, it’s the way you could have been.  From up here, rain our tears would be - if only we could cry - Now we see the whole forest from the hill.  Back then, you were the only tree in a chowchow dream. -"Be a good girl" you told me to be telling you and I still do.
Shshsh, be quiet now


Steep hills stretch off into the distance, blue, 
a wide expanse of valley in between.
Hawks are hovering in the sparkling sky, 
and glide so elegantly o’er the scene.

Such vastness on view takes ones breath away, 
transporting minds into another place.
One walks over the ground of tufted grass
green carpet, spread for miles across this space.

A river winds along its snaking way, 
clear water shining bright under the sun, 
And trees in thickets, dot the broad landscape, 
giving sweet shade to cows, such coolness won.

To sit, to dream and thus to contemplate, 
endless vistas that so attract the eye.
Nature in all its colours, fill this earth, 
and compliment the wide clear azure sky.


Sending All Arabia, as I pass.
Decided not to look at her face, 
So I increased my walking pace.
But her beauty  was like a fine trap, 
I became a prey, my heart did scrap.
She made my passions blow like flood, 
But when I looked, frozen my blood.
For 'to see her is to love her, 
And love but her for ever; 
For Nature made her what she is, 
And never made another. 


'The other day I saw a lass,

'don't undress my love
you might find a mannequin:
don't undress the mannequin 
you might find
my love. 

It brought him hope, he thought.
With all the tricks he sought
To have the other bought.
Now facing stress, he fought
The troubles his lie brought.
The trouble now he’s got, 
Lying uptight on his cot.
Thoughts of his name to pot.
Trapped he makes a shot
On how he could trot. 

Deep within a cell of my own making, 
The door remains unlocked -
I have but to open it; 

Refuge from the world outside my door, 
From the trappings of my mind -
The choice is mine; 

Self-preservation holds me prisoner, 
No shackles bind me here -
Yet here I stay; 

Outside the world is scarey beautiful, 
Safely predictable within -
What could it hurt? 

Let me push that boundary just a little, 
Fresh and sweet the air -
Through that open door.


ading reality, 
Vulgarize living; 
Trapped in emptiness, 

Unknown of a promising destiny.
Dwelling supreme, 

Amidst impurities; 
A tough dealing-

The road to reality is misleading

Lies beneath lies; 
Shameful face never as ugly as its true color

What else to be hidden! 
Mourning the sacred death of living-

Trying to live-
The truth within me is bleeding, 

Smiling-

Here I’m ruling-
Dwelling supreme, 
Trapped in false living.

Are you trapped, 
In a career, 
No future, 
No end at near! 

Do you want to get out, 
If you do, would you shout? 

The trouble about this revolving door, 
Is that it could have been easily solved several times before! 

You didn't have to end up here, 
You didn't have to all! 

The solution is quite simple, 
You should have paid attention, 
When I did! 

Pay attention in school, 
Hit the books, 
School pays dividends, 
And rich rewards, 
Some think grades, 
Are what you are learning, 
I say if you feel trapped, 
And change is what you are learning, 
Try to prepare for your future today. 

Follow this: 
Stay in school, 
Don't dropp out, 
For if you do become, 
A dropp oout of school today, 
You simply become a prime case 
for dropp out of the human race! 

Are you trapped in a career, 
No future, 
No end near, 
Don't dropp out, 
Be cool and 
Most of all stay in school! ! 

Alone with my thoughts that's how it should be
I loved this man and he said it's only me
But of late I'm not sure
If we are just friends or could become something more
He makes me so angry 
And at times I'm unhappy
On days like these I think about what it's like to be alone
Life after.  

don (dawn)  is my true question
One time I said me or her as I proceeded to give him an ultimatum
He said 'see ya' because she was never an option
But he didn't choose me
Now I'm enraged filled with jealousy and thanks to him, I'm thinking differently
I feel as if I'm between the devil and the deep blue sea
It's either him rather than choosing me

Alone with my thoughts that's how it should be
Maybe I'd stop crying if u gave me an apology
But how could you when you don't know how much you've hurt me
A woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea


I see you
you magnify when you sit at the bottom of that glass hung over
Alcohol to the limit, its hijacking wisdom, taking control of your system
Putting me in a position, making me the victim of loneliness

While you’re headed somewhere else, 
Illusion, confusion, your vision doubled, to twice the trouble
And then you start rambling, how tequila taste like water
And something crazy about your mother, and why Jack Daniel has a beard
Weird?

If I was recording, you would curse the day, that liquid touched your lips
If you would believe what I say and not think I was tipsy
And if you would remember, the ninety nine bottles of beer I counted
All those cans you opened, and the gallons of keg you fountained

You might stop, or maybe not But I hope
You remember me somewhere in that disinfected memory
As I watch you empty, sitting alone
It’s like you left me trapped at the bottom of the glass

To watch the whiskey in control
What a man


My soul keeps secrets only known to me, it cannot abandon me. Its a hidden area that noone can see, but for me.
Locked within it are memories of long ago scars. Its a journal, a master key to who is really me.
This is my safeguarded place that is isolated in solitude and something I can't seem to face. 

the wind blows hard tonight


Time Fades The Smile, Not The Pain. 
Time Drains The Water Not The Damage From The Rain. 
Time Fades The Tomorrow Not The Yesterday. 
Time Fades The Cuts But The Scars Never Go Away. 
Time Fades The Sweetness Not All The Things Sour. 
Time Fades Those Few Precious Moments But Not The Crippling Hour. 
Time Fades The Sun, Not It’s Brutal Remains. 
Time Fades The Photographs Not There Stains.
Time Fades The Lessons Not All The Things That I’ve Learned. 
Time Puts Out The Fire But Not The Days I Burned.
Time Fades The Colors Not The Glaring White. 
Time Fades The Bruises Not The Darkness In The Night. 
Time Fades The Happiness Not The Tears.
Time Fades The Triumphs Not The Fears. 
Time Fades The Storm Not The Ocean. 
Time Fades The Memories Not The Emotion. 
Time Fades The Dreams Not The Nightmare. 
Time Fades The Hand Not The Times You Weren’t There. 
Time Fades The Beauty Not The Gloom.
Time Fades The Doors And Windows Not The Empty Room. 
Time Fades The Love Not The Empty Lie.
Time Fades The Hello But Never The Goodbye. 

I should like to rise and go 
Where the golden apples grow;-- 
Where below another sky 
Parrot islands anchored lie, 
And, watched by cockatoos and goats, 
Lonely Crusoes building boats;-- 
Where in sunshine reaching out 
Eastern cities, miles about, 
Are with mosque and minaret 
Among sandy gardens set, 
And the rich goods from near and far 
Hang for sale in the bazaar;-- 
Where the Great Wall round China goes, 
And on one side the desert blows, 
And with the voice and bell and drum, 
Cities on the other hum;-- 
Where are forests hot as fire, 
Wide as England, tall as a spire, 
Full of apes and cocoa-nuts 
And the negro hunters' huts;-- 
Where the knotty crocodile 
Lies and blinks in the Nile, 
And the red flamingo flies 
Hunting fish before his eyes;-- 
Where in jungles near and far, 
Man-devouring tigers are, 
Lying close and giving ear 
Lest the hunt be drawing near, 
Or a comer-by be seen 
Swinging in the palanquin;-- 
Where among the desert sands 
Some deserted city stands, 
All its children, sweep and prince, 
Grown to manhood ages since, 
Not a foot in street or house, 
Not a stir of child or mouse, 
And when kindly falls the night, 
In all the town no spark of light. 
There I'll come when I'm a man 
With a camel caravan; 
Light a fire in the gloom 
Of some dusty dining-room; 
See the pictures on the walls, 
Heroes fights and festivals; 
And in a corner find the toys 
Of the old Egyptian boys. 

The railroad track is miles away, 
    And the day is loud with voices speaking, 
Yet there isn't a train goes by all day 
    But I hear its whistle shrieking.

All night there isn't a train goes by, 
    Though the night is still for sleep and dreaming, 
But I see its cinders red on the sky, 
    And hear its engine steaming.

My heart is warm with friends I make, 
    And better friends I'll not be knowing; 
Yet there isn't a train I wouldn't take, 
    No matter where it's going. 

Au silence de celle qui laisse rêveur. 
—Rene Char
By boat to Seurasaari where 
the small fish were called vendace.  
A man blew a horn of birchwood 
toward the nightless sea.

Still voice. Fire that is no fire. 
Ahead years unknown to be lived—



Bells from the tower in the all-at-once, then 
one by one, hours. Outside 
(so fleetingly) ourselves—

In a still mirror, in a blue within
where this earthly journey dreaming
itself begins,

thought into being from the hidden to the end of the visible.



Mountains before and behind, 
heather and lichen, yarrow, gorse,
then a sea village of chartreuse fronds.

Spent fuel, burnt
wind, mute swans.



We drove the birch-lined 
highway from Dresden 
to Berlin behind armored 
cars in late afternoon, 
nineteenth of June, passing 
the black cloud of a freight 
truck from Budapest.

Through disappearing
villages, past horses grazing vanished fields.




The year before you died, America 
went to war again on the other 
side of the world.
This is how the earth becomes, 
you said, a grotto of skeletons.




In the ruins of a station: a soaked 
bed, broken chairs, a dead coal stove.

White weather, chalk and basalt, 
puffins, fuchsia and history shot 
through with particles 
of recognition: this one 
wetted down with petrol then 
set alight, that one taking 
forty rounds, this other 
found eleven years later in a bog.

In the station house, imaginary 
maps, smoke chased by wind, a registry 
of arrivals, the logs of ghost 
ships and a few prison 




Do you remember the blue-leaved lilies?   
The grotto, the hoarfrost, the frieze?  

Through the casements of glass hand-blown 
before the war, a birch tree lets snow drop 
through its limbs onto other birches. Birch twigs
in wind through glass.

Who were we then? Such 
a laughter as morning peeled 
its light from us!   




You said the cemeteries were full in a voice 
like wind plaiting willows—fields in bloom 
but silent without grasshoppers or bees.  
What do you want then? You with your 

neverness, your unknown, 
your book of things, you
with once years ahead to be lived.




Your father believes he took you 
with him, that you are
in an urn beside your sleeping mother
but I am still writing with your hand,
as you stand in your still-there of lighted words.




Such is the piano's sadness and the rifle's moonlight.  
Stairwells remember as do doors, but windows do not—

do not, upon waking, gaze out a window 
if you wish to remember your dream




An ache of hope that you will come back—
the cawing flock is not your coming.

Did you float toward Salzburg? A wind
in the mustard fields?—or walk instead 
beside me through the asylum in Krakow?   
Hours after your death you seemed 
everywhere at once like the swifts at twilight.  
Now your moments are clouds
in a photograph of swifts. 




In the hour held 
open between day and night under 
the meteor showers of Perseid
we held each other for the last time.

Dead, you whispered where is the road?  

There, through the last of the sentences, just there—
through the last of the sentences, the road—



I am packing to go to the airport 
but somehow I am never packed. 
I keep remembering more things 
I keep forgetting. 

Secretly the clock is bolting 
forward ten minutes at a click 
instead of one. Each time 
I look away, it jumps. 

Now I remember I have to find 
the cats. I have four cats 
even when I am asleep. 
One is on the bed and I slip 

her into the suitcase. 
One is under the sofa. I 
drag him out. But the tabby 
in the suitcase has vanished. 

Now my tickets have run away. 
Maybe the cat has my tickets. 
I can only find one cat. 
My purse has gone into hiding. 

Now it is time to get packed. 
I take the suitcase down. 
There is a cat in it but no clothes. 
My tickets are floating in the bath 

tub full of water. I dry them. 
One cat is in my purse 
but my wallet has dissolved. 
The tickets are still dripping. 

I look at the clock as it leaps 
forward and see I have missed 
my plane. My bed is gone now. 
There is one cat the size of a sofa. 

I am only leaving you
for a handful of days
but it feels as thought
i will be gone forever
the way the door closes
behind me with such solidity
the way my suitcase
carries everything
i'd need for an eternity
of traveling light
i have left my hotel number 
on your desk, instructions
about the dog
and heating dinner. but
like the weather front
they warn is on its way
with its switchblades
of wind and ice 
our lives have minds
of their own


Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.

By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car
and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;
she had stiffened already, almost cold.
I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.

My fingers touching her side brought me the reason--
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,
alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.

The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;
under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;
around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.

I thought hard for us all--my only swerving--,
then pushed her over the edge into the river. 

The prophetic tribe of the ardent eyes
Yesterday they took the road, holding their babies
On their backs, delivering to fierce appetites
The always ready treasure of pendulous breasts.

The men stick their feet out, waving their guns
Alongside the caravan where they tremble together,
Scanning the sky their eyes are weighted down
In mourning for absent chimeras.

At the bottom of his sandy retreat, a cricket
Watched passing, redoubles his song,
Cybele, who loves, adds more flower,

Makes fountains out of rock and blossoms from desert
Opening up before these travelers in a yawn—
A familiar empire, the inscrutable future.






Guire


I have a little experience of travelling the world.
I even don’t know how to jump
And never stood before a waterfall for real
But nowadays in my sleep
I’ve weird dreams, none of them happens 
in the soil of my land 

The night before last 
I was drowning in the Victoria Fall in my dream
Did you think I was trying hard and fast to float? 
I didn’t-how could I benefit? 

I had my confidence in the laws of physics
when it comes to floating 
how it works for matter and liquid 
I knew I was drowning 
I even didn’t throw my hands and feet 
I was stoic
I was breathing the water in the fall
 in my sleep
in the dream-
I was drowning.

I was trying but my memory didn’t help
the ‘kolemah’ I knew by heart
didn’t come to me

But I remember
I uttered your name three times
before I drowned.




The branches dance in the wind, 
The ones outside my window
Across from my desk.
I suppose you know the trees
Of which I speak, for I've written
Oft of their power over me.

Refractors of emerald sunlight
Bending their wavelengths 
To the frequency of my soul, 
Trampolines of splashing raindrops, 
Tangoed partners to the rhythm of the wind
But one thing I've never told you, 
One thing you need to know─
The branches, they talk to me.
The branches, they've told me
Who you are.

Perhaps it's because I have 
Grafted myself into the woods
And the lonely places where only
The love of rock and stone and 
Wildness carries me, 
Perhaps it is because the song
Of the wood and the streams
And the high places where 
Sky and mountain mingle
Without border, and where
My soul was reforged with 
Timber and stone; 
Perhaps because they
See me not as a man
At a desk, but as a brother
Bound in the intimacy
Of breathing each other's
Breath, sharing a single heart, 
Perhaps for this reason alone
They have told me who you are.

If you wish to know me, 
You must be willing to walk
Among the cliffs where 
Loneliness is my shelter.
You must be able to huddle
against the winds of the abyss
and listen to the whisper of the zephyr, 
place your ears to the lips
of men lying in the gutter, 
to the ground up from which
wells the groans of humanity. 
for this is the path of the poet.

If you wish, instead, to merely
Drink from my cistern, 
You will find the water cold and sweet
But it will leave within you 
A hollowness as deep as
The soul of the mountain
And a heaviness as vast 
as the grief of humanity.

Step you carefully, 
you who would tread
the heart of a poet. 



At  the  end  of  Heaven's  rainbow, 
There's  a  treasure  that  I've  found.
Never  gleaned  from  golden  nuggets
Nor  from  diamonds  underground.

These  are  treasures  not  as  precious 
As  the  one  I  now  possess.
I  don't  need  them, now  I've  found  her; 
Earthly  treasures  mean  much  less.

You  may  wonder  how  I'll  answer.
Just  how  precious  can  she  be? 
'I  feel  Heaven  and  the  angels
Every  time  she  touches  me.'

'I  see  visions  of  the  cosmos, 
Sparkling  colors  in  her  eyes.
I  hear  music  soft  and  gentle, 
Taking  me  to  paradise.'

'I  smell  springtime  in  her  fragrence, 
Taste  her  lips  of  berry  wine.
And  I  sleep  in  sweet  contentment, 
Knowing  that  this  treasure's  mine.

How fortunate are we
To have a chest
Full of exquisitely crafted, feather light
Diamonds, gems and stones  
Dazzling right in front of us- unexplored

Bequeathed upon us 
And making us one of the richest 
And most sophisticated 
Members of human race
Here the words unveil the obvious 
And the toughest of alien truths   
And opinions-
The opinion that counts
The opinion that matters
The opinion that impacts 
The opinion that swears by global peace
Love and well being of teeming masses  
And the credit for all this goes to PH
The custodian of the Treasure Trove 
that we adore and value so much



Treasures


I have a treasure in my pant pocket, 
And one shining in the clouds.
I have a treasure in the swaying palms, 
And in the voices of children yelling out loud.

Treasures abound in this world so wide, 
There are treasures in my graceful stride.
I walk along so beautifully, 
A treasure to look at and see.

My children know not but love.
They are treasures handed me from above.
The most valuable treasure in the world is me.
No He is who created me. 

Tree at my window, window tree,
My sash is lowered when night comes on; 
But let there never be curtain drawn
Between you and me.

Vague dream head lifted out of the ground,
And thing next most diffuse to cloud,
Not all your light tongues talking aloud
Could be profound.

But tree, I have seen you taken and tossed,
And if you have seen me when I slept,
You have seen me when I was taken and swept
And all but lost.

That day she put our heads together,
Fate had her imagination about her,
Your head so much concerned with outer,
Mine with inner, weather. 

Holy tree of life.
Creater of life on earth.
Old as the world. 


Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Crook
And the rope of the Black Election,
'Tis the faith of the Fool that a race you rule
Can never achieve perfection:
So 'It's O, for the time of the new Sublime
And the better than human way,
When the Rat (poor beast) shall come to his own
And the Wolf shall have his day!'

For Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Beam
And the power of provocation,
You have cockered the Brute with your dreadful fruit
Till your fruit is mere stupration:
And 'It's how should we rise to be pure and wise,
And how can we choose but fall,
So long as the Hangman makes us dread,
And the Noose floats free for all?'

So Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Coign
And the trick there's no recalling,
They will haggle and hew till they hack you through
And at last they lay you sprawling:
When 'Hey! for the hour of the race in flower
And the long good-bye to sin!'
And for the lack the fires of Hell gone out
Of the fuel to keep them in!'

But Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Bough
And the ghastly Dreams that tend you,
Your growth began with the life of Man,
And only his death can end you.
They may tug in line at your hempen twine,
They may flourish with axe and saw;
But your taproot drinks of the Sacred Springs
In the living rock of Law.

And Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Fork,
When the spent sun reels and blunders
Down a welkin lit with the flare of the Pit
As it seethes in spate and thunders,
Stern on the glare of the tortured air
Your lines august shall gloom,
And your master
beam be the last thing whelmed
In the ruining roar of Doom. 


I think that I shall never see	 
A poem lovely as a tree.	 
 
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest	 
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast; 	 
 
And lifts her leafy arms to pray; 	 
 
A tree that may in summer wear	 
A nest of robins in her hair; 	 
 
Upon whose bosom snow has lain; 	 
Who intimately lives with rain.	 


 
Poems are made by fools like me,	 

Trees and the menace of night;
Then a long, lonely, leaden mere
Backed by a desolate fell,
As by a spectral battlement; and then,
Low-brooding, interpenetrating all,
A vast, gray, listless, inexpressive sky,
So beggared, so incredibly bereft
Of starlight and the song of racing worlds,
It might have bellied down upon the Void
Where as in terror Light was beginning to be.

Hist! In the trees fulfilled of night
(Night and the wretchedness of the sky)
Is it the hurry of the rain?
Or the noise of a drive of the Dead,
Streaming before the irresistible Will
Through the strange dusk of this, the Debateable Land
Between their place and ours?

Like the forgetfulness
Of the work-a-day world made visible,
A mist falls from the melancholy sky.
A messenger from some lost and loving soul,
Hopeless, far wandered, dazed
Here in the provinces of life,
A great white moth fades miserably past.

Thro' the trees in the strange dead night,
Under the vast dead sky,
Forgetting and forgot, a drift of Dead
Sets to the mystic mere, the phantom fell,
And the unimagined vastitudes beyond. 


Trees Of Dreams 
 
Hark! O Traveler! 
Before you die, 
Deposit your dreams
With the wind and water
For safe-keeping.
Into trees I will then those dreams turn; 
From the humus of your body
To nurture flowers, I will return. 


leaves rustling 

sounds unheard, of nature
become synphonious

airly resounding of musical
leavenings

echoing the warblers high

to the clouded  sky, and to
the flowers that 

are closing for the day beyond
the soundstrees waving their branches, 
leaves rustling

There stood a low and ivied roof,
As gazing rustics tell,
In times of chivalry and song
'Yclept the holy well.

Above the ivies' branchlets gray
In glistening clusters shone;
While round the base the grass-blades bright
And spiry foxglove sprung.

The brambles clung in graceful bands,
Chequering the old gray stone
With shining leaflets, whose bright face
In autumn's tinting shone.

Around the fountain's eastern base
A babbling brooklet sped,
With sleepy murmur purling soft
Adown its gravelly bed.

Within the cell the filmy ferns
To woo the clear wave bent;
And cushioned mosses to the stone
Their quaint embroidery lent.

The fountain's face lay still as glass-
Save where the streamlet free
Across the basin's gnarled lip
Flowed ever silently.

Above the well a little nook
Once held, as rustics tell,
All garland-decked, an image of
The Lady of the Well.

They tell of tales of mystery,
Of darkling deeds of woe;
But no! such doings might not brook
The holy streamlet's flow.

Oh tell me not of bitter thoughts,
Of melancholy dreams,
By that fair fount whose sunny wall
Basks in the western beams.

When last I saw that little stream,
A form of light there stood,
That seemed like a precious gem,
Beneath that archway rude:

And as I gazed with love and awe
Upon that sylph-like thing,
Methought that airy form must be
The fairy of the spring.




TREMBLED HEARTS

In my visions, I see many things
that come to me in darken dreams; 
I see many darken knights 
taking flight for their lives
something isn't right, 
with their own sight, 
I had seen all joy departed
and left them all broken hearted, 
then they must open their eyes
while they walk in awaken dream, 
life isn't what it seems; 
the sand is hot so is the cooling place
to all those that lost their faith, 
drams by day
dreams by night
so many taken flight like a kite 
into the deep dark night, 
woe to those they call an outcast
but those will fight back, 
Oh, the eyes are cast
A spell is on the making
To all spirits that are slowly sinking, 
While they look back at their own ill past, 
Loneliness taken down their souls
Now it's time to let it all go
Don't come to thee stand boldly, 
Storms ride the tide that comes at night, 
trembled hearts that come from far
Just to lead you deeper in the dark.



My smile trembles, 
My voice shakes.
In this dreary scenery.

Simply exchanging words, 
Make me happy.
While being embraced, 
By your gently eyes.

My hart trembles, 
My knees are shaking.
In this dreamy fantasy 

Still I softly, 
Dedicate my heart to you.
This is truly
An important meeting.

My soul trembles, 
My thoughts are shaking.
I am extremely lonely.

To reach but cannot, 
And since when? 
I only grow anxious, 
To leave it like this must be faith.

I believed this all along.
You are not here
You are Gone.


My destination lost, 
I sigh in isolation.
I will be smiling,

Calm wonder of the night
Has made love seem well tight.
Before me, a fair sight
Released joy, which took flight.
That great joy ascends right
From the heart that goes bright
With heavenly soft light.
Its effect great, not slight
To the tremendous height
With love that cannot blight, 
Fills my soul with great might.
Such joy with that I plight. 

Hollow sound went deep, 
Its discharge so steep
With its blasting beep
Filled with strength to keep.
Thus snatched away sleep
That blast one did leap
To life, one had seep
In mind set at sweep
Moved within the heap
Of bliss one did reap, 
Makes one swing like neap. 


kick aside that rat as you charge 
that's busy on the face
of your dead mate whom you've no time to bury


Easter sun invites a weekend walk, around
The oldest sacred hill of local fame.
Enormous granite stones became unbound
From moorings long ago, now custom claims
The giant who dislodged them will return
One day to topple such precarious hold
And roll them down. Eager climbers learn
Their own endurance, trying skills, boldly.
Poised they push hard,  pose for camera's eye
But all in vain,  no gigantic boulder moves, 
Nor will.   Now we clamber up the mighty
Slopes to reach the topmost height, thus we prove
Trencrom can be breached and won, the all-round 
View of Cornish vista, we vote,  astounding. 





                           trials are inevitable
and should be an occasion
be joyful and not discouraged
for they are used
to produce patience

be happy.. 

in spite of.. 

When humanity is lost, 
When greed and anger took the scales, 
And justice thrown far faraway, 
We only see trials of tears.

When brute strength is forced, 
When the weak are easily trampled, 
And life of others given no value, 
We only see trials of tears.

O man, remember! Every soul has a right, 
That are sacred and protected, 
Beware silent whispers of the oppressed, 
Cause one day, justice again must certainly reappear

Three triangles of birds crossed 
Over the enormous ocean which extended 
In winter like a green beast. 
Everything just lay there, the silence, 
The unfolding gray, the heavy light 
Of space, some land now and then. 
Over everything there was passing 
A flight 
And another flight 
Of dark birds, winter bodies 
Trembling triangles 
Whose wings, 
Frantically flapping, hardly 
Can carry the gray cold, the desolate days 
From one place to another 
Along the coast of Chile. 
I am here while from one sky to another 
The trembling of the migratory birds 
Leaves me sunk inside myself, inside my own matter 
Like an everlasting well 
Dug by an immovable spiral. 
Now they have disappeared 
Black feathers of the sea 
Iron birds 
From steep slopes and rock piles 
Now at noon 
I am in front of emptiness. It’s a winter 
Space stretched out 
And the sea has put 
Over its blue face 
A bitter mask. 

Install any dishonest man
To look after and protect the humans
He shall oblige 
Improve conduct and change

People were stunned
When saw a shepherd 
Giving justice on the spot
People dug out place and found holy crown seat

People believed in his words
As holy as from that of lord
No one questioned his wisdom
He was acting as if king of mighty kingdom

It is place
That puts him above race
He feels holder of divine spirit
Improves his behavior and greets

Today scenario has changed
Leaders have poisoned
The ears of the people by telling lies
And filling their own bellies

Justice is sold in market
Many agents make it convenient 
You need to spend money or bribe
We are returning old culture of tribes


Nelson Mandela is no more
We may have only words to adore 
Pay respect for his noble work
Shed few tears with real words

"How can one be kept under bondage"
He believed sincerely since child age 
He witnessed worst kind of apartheid 
The struggle for real freedom was laid 

Even though the legacy has remained
We have senselessly maintained
Its existence over mankind
On the basis of cast, creed and well defined

"Blacks can not rule over white"
They have, in fact, no place or right 
He raised banner of revolt
This was just beginning n and blue from bolt

How many years of youth behind bars? 
Yet he remained as an idol and star
He never hated even subjected to torture
He had in mind only country’s future

"Hate as much as you can"
Master over the art and be ardent fan 
It will teach you about universal love
It was his commitment and honestly believed

Peaceful existence was his main principle
The local population never faced any problem
The white and black have existed side by side
He has been recognized worldwide

Let us pay tribute to great son 
Let us have different opinion and reasons
The cast, color and creed may never go
But let us grant freedom and liberty and allow


One must be really like you from the native country to comprehend, 
One must be truly like me from the tropical country to understand, 
And to feel at this very moment the stinging lashes
Unjustly burning the flesh of our ancestors to ashes.

One must be in our skin; one must have our blood, 
And have walked under the hot sun of bad weathers
To understand the long moaning of our soul, 
The suffering of our people and the miseries of our ladies.

In my heart, you remain, ad vitam aeternam, one of the fathers of negritude, 
Which has inspired your children scattered all over
The world. Today, you're gone and I'm sad. I still feel the iron collar

Of slavery smothering, strangling, and suffocating me, 
And the kicks of the iron boots of this sad and inhumane history.

Author of the poetry book 'Sparkles of Love'


Without having to be told
Courage is manning up
When you know you've done something wrong
Courage is looking the enemy in the eye
And telling them to just bring it
Courage is having fear
But still staying strong
Courage is facing adversity
But being able to overcome it
Courage is leaving your family behind
To defend the country you love
Courage is being a soldier
In the greatest army in the world
Thank you for this courage
That lets us live free
And come home safely to your families


After years of togetherness, nearly three-score
I pen the Saga of being with you.
Of living and loving as never before, 
And  learning of freedom, and happiness too.




With resilience, consistence, and outright charm
You tenderly made me your wife.
Wrapping me tight in your youthful warm arms
You became to me 'Love of my Life'.




You epitomise gentleness, quietly contained; 
Yet evoking a passion so rare.
'Light of my heart', our ties have remained
Evergreen, and will always be there.



Love is a spirit-fruit, not caged in Time.
And as such it remains ever new.
Love's buoyed up our tears, made our poem to rhyme.
It's a fairy tale really come true.



Partner and lover, husband and friend, with
You I have laughed, cried and prayed.
Age has not dimmed our song of romance
For with Eternity love is inlaid. 

Fathers come and fathers go
But this I have to say -
My father may be dead and gone
But I love him to this day; 

He used to really rule the roost
We never crossed that line -
Or if we did we'd get the boot
Somewhere on our behind! 

Yet still, he was a gentle man
He loved to read and play -
He taught us all about the stars, 
And heaven's wondrous ways; 

Each year on our vacation
There were many sights to see -
He planned the best route on the map
Excitement was the key; 

He helped us with our homework
Though he did it his own way -
He always found a short cut
But the answers were OK; 

He loved to go exploring
The mountains were his thing -
And any type of scenery
Could make his spirit sing; 

His friends nicknamed him 'Hozen'
He was German by descent -
(There was a word that followed it, 
They all knew what it meant): 

My father died in 'From a  tumor in his brain -
They said it came on suddenly
It had a scarey name; 

Though many years have come and gone
The memories still abound -
Alive in his uniqueness
I can feel he's still around.

Love is the composite

.  of many fine traits, 
With finesse drawn from caring, 

 


by small  acts
Toward hurt hearts.

.  .   

Love always intiates
Qualities like gentle
.  . 
compassion, factual
Usage of such gives results 
. 


without scheming.

Love heals sick minds when

. even an enemy
Counts enough to disarm anger

. from feelings
Rank with hostility.  

.  . . Love will defend
Most selfishness, 

. . injecting hope into
Those with need.
. . 

moreover love feeds kindness

  


libera lly.

Love you are mighty, 

  .  . .. from you
Pours the best medicine
.  . .. 

this world

  .   will ever find. 


You readily decided to have me
Conceived, a mother, come to be 
Survived cravings, bout of morning illness, 
Backaches, warm nights of sleeplessness
Sweated nine months, stressed by discomfort
Still, through trimesters, willingly worked
From kitchen to school, relentlessly slogged
Taking precautions, your love safely carried
Me: in your womb.  I kicked, you sensed
Inside you, joy of my telling presence
You even caressed me and sang a song
I rested calm, felt mother’s love, strong.

We readied, make our first date, face to face
At appointed time, your body rushed service: 
To deliver me into your arms, hear my first cry
Through odds, labour pains; how hard you tried, 
To delivered me, into your world: You screamed
For me! I was born, crying for you! I was welcomed! 
Mother’s arms, first embrace! Did you wonder, the miracle
Gave me a name, even called me before I was born! 
Warm in fine linen, breast fed me as your gazes adorned 
Thankful for all the love and care, through the years, shown
I now understand motherhood, as I have a child of my own
This is my tribute to you: there’s no mom like you, ever


Cesar, the Vallejo of the impure ones
you are not dead so far, 
in nights without shape
by roads to sticks
as leaf of whirlwind
or suffocated root in alien ground.

Always in the fall
the panpipes illuminate 
you don't escape by windows or absolutes
with your rain nails of youth.

You are alone in Andean air
on a tree red Yagual that it blooms
under the broken sky
of a stony place
where your words copulate happy.

You are the loser that will continue succeeding, 
you don't need friends
rehearsing their chimeras
wet in blood of your voice.

Mountain range
it is coming toward the Ceasar of the talents, 
cross the ocean in thursday
lift it the establishment and let it fall
in homage to his heart. 


LIE here, without a record of thy worth,
Beneath a covering of the common earth!
It is not from unwillingness to praise,
Or want of love, that here no Stone we raise;
More thou deserv'st; but 'this' man gives to man,
Brother to brother, 'this' is all we can.
Yet they to whom thy virtues made thee dear
Shall find thee through all changes of the year:
This Oak points out thy grave; the silent tree
Will gladly stand a monument of thee. 
We grieved for thee, and wished thy end were past;
And willingly have laid thee here at last:
For thou hadst lived till everything that cheers
In thee had yielded to the weight of years;
Extreme old age had wasted thee away,
And left thee but a glimmering of the day;
Thy ears were deaf, and feeble were thy knees,--
I saw thee stagger in the summer breeze,
Too weak to stand against its sportive breath,
And ready for the gentlest stroke of death. 
It came, and we were glad; yet tears were shed;
Both man and woman wept when thou wert dead;
Not only for a thousand thoughts that were,
Old household thoughts, in which thou hadst thy share;
But for some precious boons vouchsafed to thee,
Found scarcely anywhere in like degree!
For love, that comes wherever life and sense
A chain of heart, a feeling of the mind,
A tender sympathy, which did thee bind 
Not only to us Men, but to thy Kind:
Yea, for thy fellow-brutes in thee we saw
A soul of love, love's intellectual law:--
Hence, if we wept, it was not done in shame;
Our tears from passion and from reason came,
And, therefore, shalt thou be an honoured name

There is a place that I know to me
in this world, nothing less,
where never we will arrive.

Where, still without our foot
it got to give for a moment
it will be, in truth, like not being.

A site is that that is seen
in each short while in this life,
walking, walking of one in row.

More here of same me and of
my pair of yolks, I have interviewed it
always far from the destinies.

Already you can iros on foot
or to pure feeling in hair,
that at him they do not arrive nor seals.

The horizon color tea
one dies to colonize to him
for its great Cualquieraparte.

But the place that I know to me,
in this world, nothing less,
hombreado it goes with the reversos.

- You close that door that
it is half-opened in the entrails
of that mirror. - This? - No; its sister.

- it is not possible to be closed. Not
she can never arrive at that site
- do goes in branch the latches.

So it is the place that I know to me. 

Notes hit my ear, 
As the water smashed against the pier.
I started making a song out of them, 
I couldn't even write.


The trill of these notes were beyond my grasp.



I walked along this beach, 
I still couldn't these notes reach.
I started wondering
Where from where this song was emanating.

Then I heard the heart of a guitar, 
A drum, 
And an electric sitar, 
And I kept mum.

Because I couldn't really hear them.
These instruments played in my brain.
Souls of talented ones, 
Who I heard on the radio and concerts, 
Played in my soul again and again.


This was heart music. 

So well she knew them both! yet as she came
Into the room, and heard their speech
Of tragic meshes knotted with her name,
And saw them, foes, but meeting each with each
Closer than friends, souls bared through enmity,
Beneath their startled gaze she thought that she
Broke as the stranger on their conference,
And stole abashed from thence. 

I have no alternate and choice
Either to share with friends or rejoice
Almighty helped me to put voice in words
Life was so easy from their onwards

Triple century in poetry field 
Not hoping for any award or shield
How could it happen is any body’s guess? 
I smile with grace and challenges face

I had just nothing in mind
Internal thoughts and blessings kind
It was first step with grand welcome
"Poem hunter" became refuge and home

How could I scale the so high peak? 
Legs were crumbling and feeling weak
Had no strength to look at ladder and top
No obstacles and march ahead non-stop

Long vision and offered vision and sight
How could I make what was wrong right? 
Easy and smooth sailing without sleepless nights

I knew nothing about poetry
How to find ways and get an entry? 
What I am today is not work of one day? 
May almighty help me to thank all and repay? 

To this auspicious day I kneel down and pray
Just allow me to express gratitude and say
I owe it all to your sincere wishes and gesture
May I also hope for you very bright tomorrow and future


Innocent decision: to enjoy.
And the pathos
of hopefulness, of his solicitude:


--he in mended serape,
she having plaited carefully
magenta ribbons into her hair,
the baby a round half-hidden shape
slung in her rebozo, and the young son steadfastly
gripping a fold of her skirt,
pale and severe under a handed-down sombrero --
all regarding 
the stills with full attention, preparing
to pay ad go in--
to worlds of shadow-violence, half-
familiar, warm with popcorn, icy
with strange motives, barbarous splendors

In the space between love and sleep
when heart mourns in its prison
eyes against shoulder keep
their blood-black curtains tight.
Body rolls back like a stone, and risen
spirit walks to Easter light;

away from its tomb of bone,
away from the guardian tents
of eyesight, walking alone
to unbearable light with angelic
gestures. The fallen instruments
of its passion lie in the relic

darkness of sleep and love.
And heart from its prison cries
to the spirit walking above:
'I was with you in agony.
Remember your promise of paradise,'
and hammers and hammers, 'remember me.



Sadness of the Moon

Tonight the moon dreams with more indolence, 
Like a lovely woman on a bed of cushions 
Who fondles with a light and listless hand 
The contour of her breasts before falling asleep;

On the satiny back of the billowing clouds,
Languishing, she lets herself fall into long swoons 
And casts her eyes over the white phantoms 
That rise in the azure like blossoming flowers.

When, in her lazy listlessness,
She sometimes sheds a furtive tear upon this globe,
A pious poet, enemy of sleep,

In the hollow of his hand catches this pale tear, 
With the iridescent reflections of opal, 
And hides it in his heart afar from the sun's eyes.



Sorrow of the Moon

More drowsy dreams the moon tonight. She rests 
Like a proud beauty on heaped cushions pressing, 
With light and absent-minded touch caressing, 
Before she sleeps, the contour of her breasts.

On satin-shimmering, downy avalanches 
She dies from swoon to swoon in languid change, 
And lets her eyes on snowy visions range 
That in the azure rise like flowering branches.

When sometimes to this earth her languor calm
Lets streak a stealthy tear, a pious poet,
The enemy of sleep, in his cupped palm,

Takes this pale tear, of liquid opal spun 
With rainbow lights, deep in his heart to stow it 
Far from the staring eyeballs of the Sun.



The Sadness of the Moon

Tonight the moon, by languorous memories obsessed, 
Lies pensive and awake: a sleepless beauty amid 
The tossed and multitudinous cushions of her bed, 
Caressing with an abstracted hand the curve of her breast.

Surrendered to her deep sadness as to a lover, for hours 
She lolls in the bright luxurious disarray of the sky — 
Haggard, entranced — and watches the small clouds float by 
Uncurling indolently in the blue air like flowers.

When now and then upon this planet she lets fall,
Out of her idleness and sorrow, a secret tear,
Some poet — an enemy of slumber, musing apart — 

Catches in his cupped hands the unearthly tribute, all 
Fiery and iridescent like an opal's sphere, 
And hides it from the sun for ever in his heart.



Tristesses de la lune

the moon tonight, more indolently dreaming,
as on a pillowed bed, a woman seems,
caressing with a hand distraught and gleaming,
her soft curved bosom, ere she sinks in dreams.

against a snowy satin avalanche
she lies entranced and drowned in swooning hours,
her gaze upon the visions born to blanch
those far blue depths with ever-blossoming flowers.

and when in some soft languorous interval,
earthward, she lets a stealthy tear-drop fall,
a poet, foe to slumber, toiling on,

with reverent hollow hand receives the pearl,
where shimmering opalescences unfurl,
and shields it in his heart, far from the sun.



Sorrows of the Moon

Tonight the moon dreams in a deeper languidness,
And, like a beauty on her cushions, lies at rest;
While drifting off to sleep, a tentative caress
Seeks, with a gentle hand, the contour of her breast;

As on a crest above her silken avalanche,
Dying, she yields herself to an unending swoon,
And sees a pallid vision everywhere she’d glance,
In the azure sky where blossoms have been strewn.

When sometime, in her weariness, upon her sphere
She might permit herself to sheda furtive tear,
A poet of great piety, a foe of sleep,

Catches in the hollow of his hand that tear,
An opal fragment, iridescent as a star;
Within his heart, far from the sun, it’s buried deep.


Triumph—may be of several kinds—
There's Triumph in the Room
When that Old Imperator—Death—
By Faith


If the word Love
Coming out of heart
Loves once, 
Hatred will dive
In immeasurable depth
Of oceans. 


Thus far the Muse has trac'd in useful lays 
   The proper implements for wintry ways;
   Has taught the walker, with judicious eyes,
   To read the various warnings of the skies.
   Now venture, Muse, from home to range the town,
   And for the public safety risk thy own.

       For ease and for dispatch, the morning's best;
   No tides of passengers the street molest.
   You'll see a draggled damsel, here and there,
  From Billingsgate her fishy traffic bear;
  On doors the sallow milk-maid chalks her gains;
  Ah! how unlike the milk-maid of the plains!
  Before proud gates attending asses bray,
  Or arrogate with solemn pace the way;
  These grave physicians with their milky cheer,
  The love-sick maid and dwindling beau repair;
  Here rows of drummers stand in martial file,
  And with their vellum thunder shake the pile,
  To greet the new-made bride. Are sounds like these
  The proper prelude to a state of peace?
  Now industry awakes her busy sons,
  Full charg'd with news the breathless hawker runs:
  Shops open, coaches roll, carts shake the ground,
  And all the streets with passing cries resound.

      If cloth'd in black, you tread the busy town
  Or if distinguish'd by the rev'rend gown,
  Three trades avoid; oft in the mingling press,
  The barber's apron soils the sable dress;
  Shun the perfumer's touch with cautious eye,
  Nor let the baker's step advance too nigh;
  Ye walkers too that youthful colours wear,
  Three sullying trades avoid with equal care;
  The little chimney-sweeper skulks along,
  And marks with sooty stains the heedless throng;
  When small-coal murmurs in the hoarser throat,
  From smutty dangers guard thy threaten'd coat:
  The dust-man's cart offends thy clothes and eyes,
  When through the street a cloud of ashes flies;
  But whether black or lighter dyes are worn,
  The chandler's basket, on his shoulder borne,
  With tallow spots thy coat; resign the way,
  To shun the surly butcher's greasy tray,
  Butcher's, whose hands are dy'd with blood's foul stain,
  And always foremost in the hangman's train.

      Let due civilities be strictly paid.
  The wall surrender to the hooded maid;
  Nor let thy sturdy elbow's hasty rage
  Jostle the feeble steps of trembling age;
  And when the porter bends beneath his load,
  And pants for breath, clear thou the crowded road.
  But, above all, the groping blind direct,
  And from the pressing throng the lame protect.
  You'll sometimes meet a fop, of nicest tread,
  At ev'ry step he dreads the wall to lose,
  And risks, to save a coach, his red-heel'd shoes;
  Him, like the miller, pass with caution by,
  Lest from his shoulder clouds of powder fly.
  But when the bully, with assuming pace,
  Cocks his broad hat, edg'd round with tarnish'd lace,
  Yield not the way; defy his strutting pride,
  And thrust him to the muddy kennel's side;
  He never turns again, nor dares oppose,
  But mutters coward curses as he goes.

      If drawn by bus'ness to a street unknown,
  Let the sworn porter point thee through the town;
  Be sure observe the signs, for signs remain,
  Like faithful land-marks to the walking train.
  Seek not from prentices to learn the way,
  Those fabling boys will turn thy steps astray;
  Ask the grave tradesman to direct thee right,
  He ne'er deceives, but when he profits by 't.

      Where fam'd St. Giles's ancient limits spread,
  An inrail'd column rears its lofty head,
  Here to sev'n streets sev'n dials count the day,
  And from each other catch the circling ray.
  Here oft the peasant, with enquiring face,
  Bewilder'd, trudges on from place to place;
  He dwells on ev'ry sign with stupid gaze,
  Enters the narrow alley's doubtful maze,
  Tries ev'ry winding court and street in vain,
  And doubles o'er his weary steps again.
  Thus hardy Theseus with intrepid feet,
  Travers'd the dang'rous labyrinth of Crete;
  But still the wand'ring passes forc'd his stay,
  Till Ariadne's clue unwinds the way.
  But do not thou, like that bold chief, confide
  Thy vent'rous footsteps to a female guide;
  She'll lead thee with delusive smiles along,
  Dive in thy fob, and drop thee in the throng.

      When waggish boys the stunted besom ply
  To rid the slabby pavement, pass not by
  E'er thou hast held their hands; some heedless flirt
  Will over-spread thy calves with spatt'ring dirt.
  Where porters hogsheads roll from carts aslope,
  Or brewers down steep cellars stretch the rope,
  Where counted billets are by carmen tost,
  Stay thy rash steps, and walk without the post


  When rosemary, and bays, the poet's crown,
 Are bawl'd in frequent cries through all the town,
 Now with bright holly all your temples strow,
 With laurel green and sacred mistletoe.
 Now, heav'n-born Charity, thy blessings shed;
 Bid meagre Want uprear her sickly head:
 Bid shiv'ring limbs be warm; let plenty's bowl
 In humble roofs make glad the needy soul.
 See, see, the heav'n-born maid her blessings shed;
 Lo! meagre Want uprears her sickly head;
 Cloth'd are the naked, and the needy glad,
 While selfish Avarice alone is sad.


    Proud coaches pass, regardless of the moan
 Of infant orphans, and the widow's groan;
 While Charity still moves the walker's mind,
 His lib'ral purse relieves the lame and blind.
 Judiciously thy half-pence are bestow'd,
 Where the laborious beggar sweeps the road.
 Whate'er you give, give ever at demand,
 Nor let old age long stretch his palsy'd hand.
 Those who give late are importun'd each day,
 And still are teas'd because they still delay.
 If e'er the miser durst his farthings spare,
 He thinly spreads them through the public square,
 Where, all beside the rail, rang'd beggars lie,
 And from each other catch the doleful cry;
 With heav'n, for two-pence, cheaply wipes his score,
 Lifts up his eyes, and hastes to beggar more.


    Where the brass knocker, wrapt in flannel band,
 Forbids the thunder of the footman's hand;
 Th' upholder, rueful harbinger of death,
 Waits with impatience for the dying breath;
 As vulture, o'er a camp, with hov'ring flight,
 Snuff up the future carnage of the fight.
 Here canst thou pass, unmindful of a pray'r,
 That heav'n in mercy may thy brother spare

Of the Implements for Walking the Streets, 
and Signs of the Weather.


Through winter streets to steer your courses aright,
How to walk clean by day, and safe by night, 
How jostling crowds, with prudence to decline,
When to assert the wall, and when resign, 
I sing: thou, Trivia, goddess, aid my song,
Through spacious streets conduct thy bard along;
By thee transported, I securely stray 
Where winding alleys lead the doubtful way,
The silent court, and opening square explore,
And long perplexing lanes untrod before.
To pave thy realm, and smooth the broken ways,
Earth from her womb a flinty tribute pays;
For thee, the sturdy paver thumps the ground,
Whilst every stroke his labouring lungs resound;
For thee the scavenger bids kennels glide
Within their bounds, and heaps of dirt subside,
My youthful bosom burns with thirst of fame.
From the great theme to build a glorious name,
And bind my temples with a civic crown:
But more, my country's love demands the lays,
My country's be the profit, mine the praise.
When the black youth at chosen stands rejoice,
And 'clean your shoes' resounds from every voice;
When late their miry sides stage-coaches show,
And their stiff horses through the town move slow;
When all the Mall in leafy ruin lies,
And damsels first renew their oyster-cries:
Then let the prudent walker shoes provide,
Not of the Spanish or Morocco hide;
The wooden heel may raise the dancer's bound,
And with the scallop'd top his step be crown'd: 
Let firm, well-hammer'd soles protect thy feet
Through freezing snows, and rains, and soaking sleet.
Should the big last extend the shoe too wide,
Each stone will wrench the unwary step aside:
The sudden turn may stretch the swelling vein,
Thy cracking joint unhinge, or ankle sprain;
And then too short the modish shoes are worn,
You'll judge the seasons by your shooting corn.
Nor should it prove thy less important care,
To choose a proper coat for winter's wear.
Now in thy trunk thy D'oily habit fold,
The silken drugget ill can fence the cold;
The frieze's spongy nap is soak'd with rain, 
And showers soon drench the camlet's cockled grain,
True Witney broad-cloth with its shag unshorn,
Unpierc'd is in the lasting tempest worn;
Be this the horseman's fence; for who would wear
Amid the town the spoils of Russia's bear!
Within the Roquelaure's clasp thy hands are pent,
Hands, that stretch'd forth invading harms prevent.
Let the loop'd Bavaroy the fop embrace,
Or his deep cloak be spatter'd o'er with lace,
That garment best the winter's rage defends,
Whose ample form without one plait depends;
By various names in various counties known,
Yet held in all the true surtout alone:
Be thine of Kersey firm, though small the cost,
Then brave unwet the rain, unchill'd the frost.
If the strong cane support thy walking hand,
Chairmen no longer shall the wall command;
Even sturdy car-men shall thy nod obey,
And rattling coaches stop to make the way;
This shall direct thy cautious tread aright,
Though not one glaring lamp enliven night.

Let beaux their canes with amber tipt produce,
Be theirs for empty show but thine for use.
In gilded chariots while they loll at east,
And lazily ensure a life's disease;
While softer chairs the tawdry load convey
To court, to White's, assemblies, or the play;
Rosy-complexion'd health thy steps attends,
And exercise thy lasting youth defends.
Imprudent men heaven's choicest gifts profane,
Thus some beneath their arm support the cane;
The dirty point oft checks the careless pace,
And miry spots the clean cravat disgrace:
O! may I never such misfortune meet,
May no such vicious walkers crowd the street,
May Providence o'ershade me with her wings,
While the bold muse experienc'd dangers sings.

Not that I wander from my native home,
And (tempting perils) foreign cities roam.
Let Paris be the theme of Gallia's muse,
Where slavery treads the street in wooden shoes
Nor do I rove in Belgia's frozen clime,
And teach the clumsy boor to skate in rhyme,
Where, if the warmer clouds in rain descend,
No wiry ways industrious steps offend,
The rushing flood from sloping pavements pours,
And blackens the canals with dirty showers.
Let others Naples' smoother streets rehearse,
And with proud Roman structures grace their verse,
Where frequent murders wake the night with groans,
And blood in purple torrents dies the stones;
Nor shall the muse through narrow Venice stray,
Where gondolas their painted oars display.
O happy streets, to rumbling wheels unknown,
No carts, no coaches shake the floating town!
Thus was of old Britannia's city bless'd,
Ere pride and luxury her sons possess'd:
Coaches and chariots yet unfashion'd lay,
Nor late-invented chairs perplex'd the way:
Then the proud lady tipp'd along the town,
And tuck'd up petticoats secur'd her gown,
Her rosy cheek with distant visits glow'd,
And exercise unartful charms bestow'd;
But since in braded gold her foot is bound,
And a long-trailing manteau sweeps the ground,
Her shoe disdains the street; the lazy fair
With narrow step affects a limping air.
Now gaudy pride corrupts the lavish age,
And the streets flame with glaring equipage;
The tricking gamester insolently rides,
With Loves and Graces on his chariot sides;
In saucy state the griping broker sits, 
And laughs at honesty, and trudging wits:
For you, O honest men, these useful lays
The muse prepares; I seek no other praise.

When sleep is first disturb'd by morning cries;
From sure prognostics learn to know the skies,
Lest you of rheums and coughs at night complain;
Surpris'd in dreary fogs, or driving rain.
When suffocating mists obscure the morn,
Let thy worst wig long us'd to storms, be worn;
This knows the powder'd footman, and with care,
Beneath his flapping hat secures his hair,
Be thou, for every season, justly drest,
Nor brave the piercing frost with open breast;
And when the bursting clouds a deluge pour,
Let thy surtout defend the drenching shower.
The changing weather certain signs reveal, 
Ere winter sheds her snow, or frosts congeal, 
You'll see the coals in bright flame aspire,
And sulpher tinge with blue the rising fire:
Your tender shins the scorching heat decline,
And at the dearth of coals the poor repine;
Before her kitchen hearth, the nodding dame
In flannel mantle wrapt, enjoys the flame
Hovering; upon her feeble knees she bends,
And all around the grateful warmth ascends.

Nor do less certain signs the town advise,
Of milder weather, and serener skies.
The ladies gaily dress'd, the Mall adorn
With various dyes, and paint the sunny morn;
The wanton fawns with frisking pleasure range,
And chirping sparrows greet the welcome change:
Not that their minds with greater skill are fraught,
Endu'd by instinct, or by reason taught,
The seasons operate on every breast,
'Tis hence that fawns are brisk, and ladies drest.
When on his box the nodding coachman snores,
And dreams of fancy'd fares; when tavern doors
The chairman idly crowd; then ne'er refuse
To trust thy busy steps in thinner shoes.
But when the swinging signs your ears offend
With creaking noise, then rainy floods impend;
Soon shall the kennels swell with rapid streams,
And rush in muddy torrents to the Thames. 
The bookseller, whose shop's an open square,
Foresees the tempest, and with early care
Of learning strips the rail; the rowing crew
To tempt a fare, clothe all their tilts in blue:
On hosier's poles depending stockings ty'd,
Flag with the slacken'd gale, from side to side:
Church-monuments foretell the changing air,
Then Niobe dissolves into a tear,
And sweats with secret grief; you'll hear the sounds,
Of whistling winds, ere kennels break their bounds;
Ungrateful odours common-shores diffuse,
And dropping vaults distil unwholesome dews,
Ere the tiles rattle with the smoking shower,
And spouts on heedless men their torrents pour.

All superstition from thy breast repel.
Let credulous boys, and prattling nurses tell,
How if the festival of Paul be clear,
Plenty from liberal horn shall strow the year;
When the dark skies dissolve in snow or rain,
The labouring hind shall yoke the steer in vain;
But if threat'ning winds in tempests roar,
Then war shall bathe her wasteful sword in gore.
How, if on Swithin's feast the welkin lowers,
And every penthouse streams with hasty showers,
Twice twenty days shall clouds their fleeces drain,
And wash the pavements with incessant rain;
Let not such vulgar tales debase thy mind;
Nor Paul nor Swithin rule the clouds and wind.
If you the precepts of the muse despise,
And slight the faithful warning of the skies,
Others you'll see, when all the town's afloat,
Wrapt in the embraces of a Kersey coat,
Or double-button'd frieze: their guarded feet
Defy the muddy dangers of the street,
While you with hat unloop'd, the fury dread
Of spouts high streaming, and with cautious tread
Shun every dashing pool; or idly stop, 
To seek the kind protection of a shop. 
But business summons; now with hasty scud
You jostle for the wall: the spatter'd mud
Hides all thy hose behind; in vain you scour,
The wig, alas! uncurl'd, admits the shower.
So fierce, Alecto's snaky tresses fell,
When Orpheus charm'd the rigorous powers of hell,
Or thus hung Glaucus' beard, with briny dew
Clotted and straight, when first his amorous view
Surpris'd the bathing fair; the frighted maid
Now stands a rock, transform'd by Circe's aid.

Good housewives all the winter's rage despise,
Defended by the riding-hood's disguise:
Or underneath the umbrella's oily shade,
Safe thro' the wet on clinking pattens tread.
Let Persian dames the umbrella's ribs display,
To guard their beauties from the sunny ray;
Or sweating slaves support the shady load,
When eastern monarchs show their state abroad
Britain in winter only knows its aid,
To guard from chilly showers the walking maid.
But O! forget not, muse, the patten's praise,
That female implement shall grace thy lays;
Say from what art divine the invention came,
And from its origin deduc'd its name,
Where Lincoln wide extends her fenny soil,
A goodly yeoman liv'd, grown white with toil:
One only daughter bless'd his nuptial bed, 
Who from her infant hand the poultry fed:
Martha (her careful mother's name) she bore,
But now her careful mother was no more.
Whilst on her father's knee the damsel play'd, 
Patty he fondly call'd the smiling maid;
As years increas'd, her ruddy beauty grew,
And Patty's fame o'er all the village flew.

Soon as the gray-ey'd morning streaks the skies,
And in the doubtful day the woodcock flies,
Her cleanly pail the pretty housewife bears,
And singing to the distant field repairs:
And when the plains with evening dews are spread
The milky burden smokes upon her head,
Deep, thro' a miry lane she picked her way,
Above her ancle rose the chalky clay.
Vulcan by chance the gloomy maiden spies,
With innocence and beauty in her eyes, 
He saw, he lov'd; for yet he ne'er had known
Sweet innocence and beauty meet in one. 
Ah Mulciber, recal thy nuptial vows, 
Think on the graces of thy Paphian spouse,
Think how her eyes dart inexhausted charms,
And canst thou leave her bed for Patty's arms?
The Lemnian power forsakes the realms above,
His bosom glowing with terrestial love:
Far in the lane a lonely hut he found,
No tenant ventur'd on the unwholesome ground.
Here smokes his forge, he bares his sinewy arm,
And early strokes the sounding anvil warm;
Around his shop the steely sparkles flew,
As for the steed he shap'd the bending shoe.

When blue ey'd Patty near his window came,
His anvil rests, his forge forgets to flame.
To hear his soothing tales she feigns delays;
What woman can resist the force of praise?
At first she coyly every kiss withstood,
And all her cheek was flush'd with modest blood:
With headless nails he now surrounds her shoes,
To save her steps from rains and piercing dews;
She lik'd his soothing tales, his presents wore,
And granted kisses, but would grant no more.
Yet winter chill'd her feet, with cold she pines,
And on her cheek the fading rose declines;
No more her humid eyes their lustre boast,
And in hoarse sounds her melting voice is lost.
This Vulcan saw, and in his heavenly thought,
A new machine mechanic fancy wrought,
Above the mire her shelter'd steps to raise,
And bare her safely through the wintry ways;
Straight the new engine on the anvil glows,
And the pale virgin on the patten rose.
No more her lungs are shook with drooping rheums,
And on her cheek reviving beauty blooms.
The god obtain'd his suit; though flattery fail,
Presents with female virtue must prevail. 
The patten now supports each frugal dame,
Which from the blue-eyed Patty takes the name. 



Three brightly lit stars
lighting up the night sky
Three smiles shining like the sun
so warm, bringing tears to my eyes
Three masterpieces of art
created by angels, just for me
Three reasons why I choose what I do
today, tomorrow, and as far as I can see
Three very distinct personalities
yet cannot think of them apart
Three more precious than gold and
diamonds, held so closely to my heart
Three words I will say to thee
everyday, in every way, 'I love you'


of course, 
I may die in the next ten minutes 
and I’m ready for that 
but what I’m really worried about is 
that my editor-publisher might retire 
even though he is ten years younger than 
I. 
it was just years ago (I was at that ripe 
old age of  
when we began our unholy alliance to 
test the literary waters, 
neither of us being much 
known. 


I think we had some luck and still have some 
of same 
yet 
the odds are pretty fair 
that he will opt for warm and pleasant 
afternoons 
in the garden 
long before I. 


writing is its own intoxication 
while publishing and editing, 
attempting to collect bills 
carries its own 
attrition 
which also includes dealing with the 
petty bitchings and demands 
of many 
so-called genius darlings who are 
not. 


I won’t blame him for getting 
out 
and hope he sends me photos of his 
Rose Lane, his 
Gardenia Avenue. 


will I have to seek other 
promulgators? 
that fellow in the Russian 
fur hat? 
or that beast in the East 
with all that hair 
in his ears, with those wet and 
greasy lips? 


or will my editor-publisher 
upon exiting for that world of Trollius and 
trellis 
hand over the 
machinery 
of his former trade to a 
cousin, a 
daughter or 
some Poundian from Big 
Sur? 


or will he just pass the legacy on 
to the 
Shipping Clerk 
who will rise like 
Lazarus, 
fingering new-found 
importance? 


one can imagine terrible 
things: 
"Mr. Chinaski, all your work 
must now be submitted in 
Rondo form 
and 
typed 
triple-spaced on rice 
paper."

life aborts 
and all you 
have left 
is a 
bunch of 
warts. 


"no, no, Mr. Chinaski: 
Rondo form!" 


"hey, man," I’ll ask, 
"haven’t you heard of 
the thirties?" 


"the thirties? what’s 
that?" 


my present editor-publisher 
and I 
at times 
did discuss the thirties, 
the Depression 
and 
some of the little tricks it 
taught us— 
like how to endure on almost 
nothing 
and move forward 
anyhow. 


well, John, if it happens enjoy your 
divertissement to 
plant husbandry, 
cultivate and aerate 
between 
bushes, water only in the 
early morning, spread

weed growth

as I do in my writing: 
use plenty of 
manure.

together we 
laid down the gauntlet 
and there are takers 
even at this late date 
still to be 
found 
as the fire sings 
through the 
trees. 

Trouble no one 

Who cares? 
And who dare
For global like things
As it has got nothing 

We talk of humanity
And show our own inability
To help others
Where as many suffer as poor

We live worst than animals
Work hard for survival
Earn two piece of bread daily
Eat it and spend time daily 

Only intelligent
And brilliant people
Get involve with discussion on soul
And give open call 

We land on earth
Take peaceful breathe
Stay as much as blessed
And finally ceased

Great people's name remain in history
Only lord is remembered daily
As we are threatened with death 
So we keep good name of conscience and faith 

Let any one answer
By making no sound as river
Make environment as calm as possible 
And trouble no one


One is followed by two, three and four
Life remains happy and not sour
There is joy and peace for family member
And memory remains intact to remember

Ife remains as we want to shape
It is shined by success cap
Yu are moving on top
With progress non-stop

If life was aimless
Yu could find it lifeless
There was not much joy
But it is for us to enjoy

Each one of us is aware
And knows where
To go and how to perform
The life is otherwise trouble torn

Act wise
And surprise
Everyone with skill
Life shall move at your will


The others bent their heads and started in.
Confused, I asked my neighbor
to explain—a sturdy, bright-cheeked girl
who brought raw milk to school from her family's
herd of Holsteins. Ann had a blue bookmark,
holding the flesh back with His wounded hand.
Ann understood division. . . .

Miss Moran sprang from her monumental desk
and led me roughly through the class
without a word. My shame was radical
as she propelled me past the cloakroom
to the furnace closet, where only the boys
were put, only the older ones at that.
The door swung briskly shut.

The warmth, the gloom, the smell
of sweeping compound clinging to the broom
soothed me. I found a bucket, turned it
upside down, and sat, hugging my knees.
I hummed a theme from Haydn that I knew
from my piano lessons. . . .
and hardened my heart against authority.
And then I heard her steps, her fingers
on the latch. She led me, blinking
and changed, back to the class. 

Lost in this cold, cruel word
No where to go 
No Love to he found
If only he could understand
Rising before sunrise
Thirsting for a taste
Scrambling, hustling, begging
Running from a past he can't erase
Living in alleys
Living on subways
Living in poverty
Living just day to day
He’s a troubled man
Misunderstood and all alone 
No money, no friends
No place to call his own
No reason to succeed
No encouragement to gain
He has his warm and half-filled bottle
Only that can ease his painsh and Davidson
Mismatched Jordans on oversized feet
Don’t have a penny to my name
Slowly cruising troubled streets
A familiar face on d
Scrambling feverishly and impatiently
Larceny and violence in heart and mind
A lifetime ahead and still no time
On h stands Leslie Williams
Led astray by a wayward parade
Desires the nightlife and uppity crowds
Refusing the guidance, the spiritual aid
Little Jimmy on h 
Was always to cool for the disciplines of school
His daddy assassinated by racial turbulence
His mother tested daily for strength and endurance
Up the block lives poor old Harry
On the corner of h
Struggling and fighting on his fixed and unmerciful income
Harry can’t recall the last decent meal he ate
The Boroughs limits, waters ahead
Stopping to ponder what I've seen
Are we meant to live so inadequately? 
Is equality just a faraway dream? 
Not just a couple of unfortunate cases
Not as if these stories are unrelated
If he shares the spoils or throw us his crumb
Then unemployment and inflation are escalated
No wins, no ties, only losses
People must die for leaders to smiles
With all the complication that accompanies life
Give them an inch and they’ll take a mile
Walking down Third Avenue
Cruising cautiously troubled streets
The ballparks are filled with the unemployed
With expensive sneakers on their feet


Where is my girl with the lisp? 
The girl with a twirl in her step
As she skipped at my side? 
Her eyes, brilliant blue, glinting
Mischief she tried hard to hide.? 
My girl of troublesome love.

Eager to find life's delight
She fought every restriction.
Amber-hair flying free, she
Ran full steam ahead until
One day she really took flight.
Oh my girl of troublesome love.

She danced to a life which became
A distance of darkness where
Love never glimmered to comfort
Her need for affection, but
Riddled with heartche and pain.
My lovely girl troubled with love.

She turned homeward, eyes igniting
Again, but with steely-glint now.
Womanhood punctured, she knew
Somehow to survive, cornered
Not beaten, but still fighting.
This time for untroublesome love. 

From today the h December
I shall have to honestly remember
Real truce may come into effect
It may end on t January in fact

Neither will I read articles
Nor chat with some individuals
It is vow to see and strictly observe
Let there be no reason to deserve


one of Lorca's best lines
is,
"agony, always
agony 


"She's the Blue Moon's
true and careless stare
one smile from her, and all my wounds
have found repair
All my questions' answers
are in the simple swirls of her hair
She's Springtime's resurrecting air; 
the sun's orange, reassuring glare; 
-my only answered prayer. 


TRUE AND CORRECTLY

Life is not for lust alone
It involves trust also 
Believe me it is sincere offer

As young lad
You may be remaining sad
For the want of good bride
As matter of pride

You feel proud
And speak loud
As you have one of the best things in possession 
And now you cling with obsession

Know one thing very clear
Have no fear
For life or death
That shall remain till the last breathe 

Make the life dependable
Cheerful and enjoyable
It has to be witnessed by both of you
With meaning correctly understood and true


Zeal is that pure and heavenly flame,
The fire of love supplies ;
While that which often bears the name,
Is self in a disguise.
True zeal is merciful and mild,
Can pity and forbear ;
The false is headstrong, fierce and wild,
And breathes revenge and war. 

True Being 


Rich hour! is not thy gift a radiant thing? 
The truth here blazoned in this marble and gold, 
Here writ in this refulgence manifold, 
Hath sunned my groped redemption: lo, I fling-- 
How lightly!--off ungraced desire; I cling 
To that faith firm this splendour hath retold: 
My spirit, towered, doth its sheer track behold, 
And shakes the dust of chaos from its wing. 
Life that is death, riches named with a lie, 
This fane would, that the sum of both employs, 
Your tears unseal if ignorance could weep. 
Is not true being locked in tombs? and die 
Must not we in death ere life's innater joys 
We may, as I now, clasp as in a sleep

The colours
were having a drink.

Purple was getting
half pissed

& looking hilariously more serious
than ever.

"It’s like I’m invisible! "
cried White.

Red said: 
"Oh, I don’t know. 
.  

I think you’re a bit of alright! "

"No one gives me a second glance! "
moaned Grey.

"It’s all so black & white! "

"You should try to be me! "
blurted out Black.

"Typecast.  

that’s what I am! "

"And yet I am
the happiest colour in town! "

"I can’t help feelin’ blue! "
chipped in blue.

"It’s in my nature! 
But I ain’t made out like
I’m made out to be! "

The other colours said nothing.

They had fallen asleep.


It was the same every week! 

Stick a bunch of colours
in a room

& it’s 
moan.   moan.  moan! 

The artist
smiled

loved them all
just for being themselves. 

leaning not on your own understanding.
Earthly troubles will never cease -
Use faith to quell the inner longing.

Regardless of your circumstance, 
you are empowered to be an overcomer.
Rejoice in the midst of difficulties; 
in His Presence, find holy favor.

He has promised to supply our needs! 
Things can not fill the hole of one’s heart.
Cleanse your mind with His Word; 

Forget fancy words, cliches and obsession
with the rhetoric of sentiment; 
Find for yourself, true contentment.



Properly digested and understood
Can keep body in perfect health
That no magic can be done even by wealth

So if words are expressive 
In sense very bold but assertive
Can spring surprises
With so much of love and harmony to promise

Words can bring war to next door
If it is told or spelled very poor
Whole toot cause of problem is word
That can push you backward or take forward

Fast development becomes easy
If words are powerful enough to be choosey
Fit them anywhere with honesty
Even may move the will power of almighty

Have sweetness to influence the opponent
That effect will remain in force as permanent
It shall bind together nations and continents
If spirit behind is read with its true contents


My boy, you may take it from me,
That of all the afflictions accurst
With which a man's saddled
And hampered and addled,
A diffident nature's the worst.
Though clever as clever can be -
A Crichton of early romance -
You must stir it and stump it,
And blow your own trumpet,
Or, trust me, you haven't a chance.

Now take, for example, MY case:
I've a bright intellectual brain -
In all London city
There's no one so witty -
I've thought so again and again.
I've a highly intelligent face -
My features cannot be denied -
But, whatever I try, sir,
I fail in - and why, sir?
I'm modesty personified!

As a poet, I'm tender and quaint -
I've passion and fervour and grace -
From Ovid and Horace
To Swinburne and Morris,
They all of them take a back place.
Then I sing and I play and I paint;
Though none are accomplished as I,
To say so were treason:
You ask me the reason?
I'm diffident, modest, and shy

Smile little black child
Smile the smile of happiness
True faces have come upon us
Shall we now embrace our enemies? 
Strangers in a land not our own
Where young and old sing his praises
Living testimony to that good old-southern religion
Warmly greeted with hugs and laughter
This the birthplace of family values
Circumstances unfortunately 
Has found you in distress
So now the smiles come with a mask
The hugs are hallow
The words of encouragement, 
Un-encouraging and shallow
True faces and the Angels are writing

Smile little black child
Smile the smile of patients and understanding
Treat thy neighbor, as you would like to be treated
For everyman must reap of what he sows
To the thirsty give drink
To the hungry give food
True faces have come upon us
Shall we now embrace our enemies? 
Does not the wicked also love his own family
Why has man’s heart become so hard and cold? 
Forgive them lord for they know not what they do
True faces and the Angels look on in shame


Understands your past
Accepts you the way you are
Trust in your future


Mary: Johnny, sweetheart, can you be true
To all those famous vows you've made?
Will you love me as I love you
Until we both in earth are laid?
Or shall the old wives nod and say
'His love was only for a day,
The mood goes by,
His fancies fly,
And Mary's left to sigh.'

Johnny: Mary, alas, you've hit the truth,
And I with grief can but admit
Hot-blooded haste controls my youth,
My idle fancies veer and flit
From flower to flower, from tree to tree,
And when the moment catches me
Oh, love goes by,
Away I fly,
And leave my girl to sigh.

Mary: Could you but now foretell the day,
Johnny, when this sad thing must be,
When light and gay you'll turn away
And laugh and break the heart in me?
For like a nut for true love's sake
My empty heart shall crack and break,
When fancies fly
And love goes by
And Mary's left to die.

Johnny: When the sun turns against the clock,
When Avon waters upward flow,
When eggs are laid by barn-door cock,
When dusty hens do strut and crow,
When up is down, when left is right,
Oh, then I'll break the troth I plight,
With careless eye
Away I'll fly
And Mary here shall die. 

True justice is never a sleep
Even when the eyes are deceived
Or the ears fall to deceit
Or the mind is blinded by a mist 
Quiet, it might seem when buried
Wrinkled by time may be
Captured by the dark, could be
but when right time comes
It will be sharp and free with drums


It is true love because
I put on eyeliner and a concerto and make pungent observations about the great issues of the day
Even when there's no one here but him,
And because
I do not resent watching the Green Bay Packer
Even though I am philosophically opposed to football,
And because
When he is late for dinner and I know he must be either having an affair or lying dead in the middle of the street,
I always hope he's dead.

It's true love because
If he said quit drinking martinis but I kept drinking them and the next morning I couldn't get out of bed,
He wouldn't tell me he told me,
And because
He is willing to wear unironed undershorts
Out of respect for the fact that I am philosophically opposed to ironing,
And because
If his mother was drowning and I was drowning and he had to choose one of us to save,
He says he'd save me.

It's true love because
When he went to San Francisco on business while I had to stay home with the painters and the exterminator and the baby who was getting the chicken pox,
He understood why I hated him,
And because
When I said that playing the stock market was juvenile and irresponsible and then the stock I wouldn't let him buy went up twenty-six points,
I understood why he hated me,
And because
Despite cigarette cough, tooth decay, acid indigestion, dandruff, and other features of married life that tend to dampen the fires of passion,
We still feel something
We can call
True love. 

True love is magnificent, 
Like the light that spilled on my cheeks.
I thought I had found that love, 
After many days and weeks.

They say true love will never fail, 
It will never die and always prevail.

The bright glow faded, 
The forever burning flame has died.
It will never burn again, 
Until my love has been replied.

The gentle hands made me cry, 
Because they told me it was all a lie.

The hearts that have been entwined, 
It seemed she didn't even bother.
The true love has faded, 
And then I realized she has another.

Reaction to, 
"True Love" by Helen Reese. 

In silence the heart raves. 

It utters words
Meaningless, that never had
A meaning. 

I was ten, skinny, red-headed,

Freckled. 

In a big black Buick,
Driven by a big grown boy, with a necktie, she sat
In front of the drugstore, sipping something

Through a straw. There is nothing like
Beauty. It stops your heart. 

It
Thickens your blood. 

It stops your breath. 

It

Makes you feel dirty. 

You need a hot bath.
I leaned against a telephone pole, and watched.
I thought I would die if she saw me.

How could I exist in the same world with that brightness?
Two years later she smiled at me. 

She
Named my name. I thought I would wake up dead.

Her grown brothers walked with the bent-knee
Swagger of horsemen. 

They were slick-faced.
Told jokes in the barbershop. Did no work.

Their father was what is called a drunkard.
Whatever he was he stayed on the third floor
Of the big white farmhouse under the maples for twenty-five years.

He never came down. 

They brought everything up to him.
I did not know what a mortgage was.

When the daughter got married, the old man came down wearing
An old tail coat, the pleated shirt yellowing.
The sons propped him. 

I saw the wedding. 

There were

Engraved invitations, it was so fashionable. 

I thought
I would cry. 

I lay in bed that night
And wondered if she would cry when something was done to her.

The mortgage was foreclosed. That last word was whispered. 
She never came back. 

The family
Sort of drifted off. 

Nobody wears shiny boots like that now.

But I know she is beautiful forever, and lives
In a beautiful house, far away.
She called my name once. 

I didn't even know she knew it. 

True love. Is it normal
 is it serious, is it practical?
 What does the world get from two people
 who exist in a world of their own?

 Placed on the same pedestal for no good reason,
 drawn randomly from millions but convinced
 it had to happen this way – in reward for what?
    For nothing.
 The light descends from nowhere.
 Why on these two and not on others?
 Doesn’t this outrage justice? Yes it does.
 Doesn’t it disrupt our painstakingly erected principles,
 and cast the moral from the peak? Yes on both accounts.

 Look at the happy couple.
 Couldn’t they at least try to hide it,
 fake a little depression for their friends’ sake?
 Listen to them laughing – it’s an insult.
 The language they use – deceptively clear.
 And their little celebrations, rituals,
 the elaborate mutual routines –
 it’s obviously a plot behind the human race’s back!

 It’s hard even to guess how far things might go
 if people start to follow their example.
 What could religion and poetry count on?
 What would be remembered? What renounced?
 Who’d want to stay within bounds?

 True love. Is it really necessary?
 Tact and common sense tell us to pass over it in silence,
 like a scandal in Life’s highest circles.
 Perfectly good children are born without its help.
 It couldn’t populate the planet in a million years,
 it comes along so rarely.

 Let the people who never find true love
 keep saying that there’s no such thing.

 Their faith will make it easier for them to live and die. 

they found him walking along the freeway
all red in
front
he had taken a rusty tin can
and cut off his sexual
machinery
as if to say --
see what you've done to
me? you might as well have the
rest.

and he put part of him
in one pocket and
part of him in
another
and that's how they found him,
walking
along.

they gave him over to the
doctors
who tried to sew the parts
back
on
but the parts were
quite contented
the way they
were.

I think sometimes of all of the good
ass
turned over to the
monsters of the

eve. 

Failing doesn't make you a failure, 
it only makes you stronger.
Don't listen to their hateful words, 
For they see the truth no longer.

They're just jealous you see, 
they've got no hidden talents to set free.
'Cause in this world, life's too short 
to not be who you want to be. 

True tenderness is silent 
and can't be mistaken for anything else.
In vain with earnest desire 
you cover my shoulders with fur;
In vain you try to persuade me 
of the merits of first love.
But I know too well the meaning 
of your persistent burning glances. 

I needed to know what’s on your mind
Willing to wager your eager to sign
The pressure is mounting 
The numbers are grand
Sensing reluctance 
To stick to the plan
Eager to see if the armor is steel
If your true to the code
If your gangster is real
Your anxious and nervous
Ready to turn 
Reaching for lifelines
With selfish concerns
Willing to trade a king’s ransom
You start naming names
Hiding in solitude
To diminish the pain
I needed to confirm your intensions to deal
A walking cadaver persuaded to squeal
The pressure is mounting
Tensions are high
Sensing reluctance
I sanction the plan
Eager to see if the armor was steel
 True to the code
Our gangster was real
Anxious and nervous
Ready to turn
Begging for lifelines
With selfish concerns
I received a king’s ransom
For turning away
Dying in solitude
He called out my name
The D. 

A. endeavored to intimidate
Attempting to menace another inmate
Applying strong pressure
With numbers so grand
I suffer mistreatment
And stick to the plan
Eager to see if my armor was steel
True to the code
My gangster was real
Cool, calm, and collected
With no selfish concerns
Gave them my finger
And welcomed my turn
Tucking away a King’s ransom
To never name names
I find solace and comfort with the undeniable fact
That I was true to the game


The Negro
With the trumpet at his lips
Has dark moons of weariness
Beneath his eyes
where the smoldering memory
of slave ships
Blazed to the crack of whips
about thighs

The negro
with the trumpet at his lips
has a head of vibrant hair
tamed down,
patent-leathered now
until it gleams
like jet-
were jet a crown

the music
from the trumpet at his lips
is honey
mixed with liquid fire
the rhythm
from the trumpet at his lips
is ecstasy
distilled from old desire-

Desire
that is longing for the moon
where the moonlight's but a spotlight
in his eyes,
desire
that is longing for the sea
where the sea's a bar-glass
sucker size

The Negro
with the trumpet at his lips
whose jacket
Has a fine one-button roll,
does not know
upon what riff the music slips

It's hypodermic needle
to his soul
but softly
as the tune comes from his throat
trouble
mellows to a golden note


Drifts of gleaming bright accost the eye.
Breeze stirs, and each dreamily sighs.

Glowing with gold now, hedgerow and field
Carpeted thus,  to Sun-god  yield, 

Who lights up their stage daily, and saves
His warmth for some yellow Spring play.

Gently he sets them a merry dance.
Daffodil days can't help but entrance.

Trumpeting treasures of golden hue
May your spread seed ever accrue. 

The one who born; 
The one who died. 
without trust; 
They can not live a life. 

The one who do the job; 
The one who give the job.  
without trust; 
They can not do work properly. 

The one who sing; 
The one who dance. 
without trust; 
They can not achieve it's goal.

The one who is so much popular; 
but without trust we can not do a work with him.
The one who is not popular; 
but that person is trustful then we can do a work with him. 

Trust is a thing, that for creating it so many year were spend; 
Trust is a thing, that to demolish it single second is enough.
Trust is created between two heart; 
Trust is demolish  more than two hundred heart's. 

This is the hardest time without you
Mixed with memories of a time we hadn't met yet
But when I had you more than now

Expecting a day that might never come
That will allow me to make up for a mistake
Leaving you when all I wanted was living with you

How could I ever believe you would leave her for me? 
Seems like that was a case of bad judgement for me
But I know without you I'll never be free

But you gave me hope and I'll just trust in you
For if it were to end now
All of this would never have ever happened at all


I trust the night 
I trust the stars that shine 
I trust the moon 
I know its love’s divine 
I trust the wind 
I trust its winding ways 
I trust the sky 
I know its separate days 
I trust the dawn 
I trust its rising light 
I trust the sun 
I know its blinding sight 
I trust the clouds 
I trust the crimson waves 
I trust the things I love 
I know that this trust saves Me. 

       Through all the grim doubts that bemock the soul, 
When in the amazement of far-reaching throught, 
       We list the labourings that for ever roll 
Like dubious thunders through those clouded regions 
       Where night and destiny the counsels keep 
Of Time developing his shadowy legions. 
And when I ve stood upon some hazardous steep 
       Of speculation—heaving up its bare 
       And rugged ridge high in the nebulous air 
Of endless change, and thence tremendously 
       Throwing its shadow, like a blind man’s stare, 
Out through the dread unknown—deep trust in Thee, 

He'll assail your ship
'Dwell in present'
inherent with deep pursuits
to live in present
means to accept and honor
to enjoy His Divine gift
good or bad
but to accept gladly.

Past is devil, only to torment
for your mistakes and waste time
Future is evil making you fearful
to withdraw your all opinions
on present and be reluctant to past.

Each moment of present reveals
with full submission. 

He will lead you through
Remember His Son

As parched in the barren sands
Beneath a burning sky,
The worthless bramble with'ring stands,
And only grows to die. 

Such is the sinner's aweful case,
Who makes the world his trust;
And dares his confidence to place
In vanity and dust. 

A secret curse destroys his root,
And dries his moisture up;
He lives awhile, but bears no fruit,
Then dies without a hope. 

But happy he whose hopes depend
The soul that trusts in such a friend,
Can ne'er be overthrown. 

Though gourds should wither, cisterns break,
And creature-comforts die;
No change his solid hope can shake,
Or stop his sure supply. 

So thrives and blooms the tree whose roots
By constant streams are fed;
Arrayed in green, and rich in fruits,
It rears its branching head. 

It thrives, though rain should be denied,
And drought around prevail;
'Tis planted by a river's side
Whose waters cannot fail. 

Fle fro the pres, and dwelle with sothefastnesse,
Suffise thin owen thing, thei it be smal;
For hord hath hate, and clymbyng tykelnesse,
Prees hath envye, and wele blent overal.
Savour no more thanne the byhove schal;
Reule weel thiself, that other folk canst reede;
And trouthe schal delyvere, it is no drede.

Tempest the nought al croked to redresse,
In trust of hire that tourneth as a bal.
Myche wele stant in litel besynesse;
Bywar therfore to spurne ayeyns an al;
Stryve not as doth the crokke with the wal.
Daunte thiself, that dauntest otheres dede;
And trouthe shal delyvere, it is no drede.

That the is sent, receyve in buxumnesse;
The wrestlyng for the worlde axeth a fal.
Here is non home, here nys but wyldernesse.
Forth, pylgryme, forth! forth, beste, out of thi stal!
Hold the heye weye, and lat thi gost the lede;
And trouthe shal delyvere, it is no drede.

[L'envoy.] 
Therfore, thou Vache, leve thine olde wrechednesse;
Unto the world leve now to be thral.
Crie hym mercy, that of hys hie godnesse
Made the of nought, and in espec{. 

i}al
Draw unto hym, and pray in general
For the, and eke for other, hevenelyche mede;
And trouthe schal delyvere, it is no drede. 

And if sun comes
How shall we greet him?
Shall we not dread him,
Shall we not fear him
After so lengthy a
Session with shade?
 
Though we have wept for him,
Though we have prayed
All through the night-years—
What if we wake one shimmering morning to
Hear the fierce hammering
Of his firm knuckles
Hard on the door?
 
Shall we not shudder?—
Shall we not flee
Into the shelter, the dear thick shelter
Of the familiar
Propitious haze?
 
Sweet is it, sweet is it
To sleep in the coolness
Of snug unawareness.
 
The dark hangs heavily
Over the eyes. 

I found our love shaped like a rose
on a lonely empty street, 
It seems so strange, so sad, to find it
lying at my feet.

With quilty heart and teary eyes
I picked it from the dirt.
I wiped away the tears, the pain.
I wiped away the hurt.

I took it home and nurtured it, 
spending hour after hour.
To make our red rose bloom again.
To save our love.  

the flower.

I cared for it and wept for it, 
until one early morn.
the rose looked new, I grabbed in haste
and was needled by its thorn.

I found that lonely street again, 
and like I knew I should, 
I left the rose
I left the street
.  

and left our love for good.


'Killing yourself does not take the pain away, for it lives on in the people who loved you'



Truth stands to last
Lies fall so fast
Truth shows the light
Lies bring the blight
Truth makes a way
Lies spoil the day
Truth makes life groom
Lies give life doom
Truth leads to gains
Lies lead to pains
Truth you cherish
Lies you don’t fish
Truth gives one thrill
Lies make one ill


Within the body lies the essence which the Vedas and the Puranas are seeking.
Within this body exists the entire Universe, so the sagacious Saints say.
Recluses, ascetics and monks are searching for Him in variegated garbs.
The learned of the world, puffed up with pride in their scholarly traditions, remain deluded by their erudition.
They delude the world through the practice of pilgrimage, fasting and charity; 
They glorify bathing in holy waters and their gollowers bear the evil consequences.
They get lost in rituals and external observances and never can reach the destination.

Such is the state of people in this world
Who keep revolving in the cycle of eighty-four.
Only the Saints have attained the Ultimate, O Tulsi,
They obtain liberation who realize this truth.
The pedantic are engrossed in the practice of traditions,
And evermore, in their ego, are they enslaved by delusion

but a cold war
fought without arms

Silence is the repentance
seeking pardon for evil deed
when stood before a corpse

Silence of graveyard
manifest eternal abode
lies with every burried body

Silence sweeps all  agony
unveiling the futile disaster
streamline the blooming peace. 

We made it from the ground-up corn in the old back pasture.
Pinched a scent of night jasmine billowing off the fence,   
popped it right in.
That frog song wanting nothing but echo?   
We used that.
Stirred it widely. Noticed the clouds while stirring.
Called upon our ancient great aunts and their long slow eyes   
of summer. Dropped in their names.   
Added a mint leaf now and then   
to hearten the broth. Added a note of cheer and worry.   
Orange butterfly between the claps of thunder?   
Perfect. And once we had it,
had smelled and tasted the fragrant syrup,   
placing the pan on a back burner for keeping,   
the sorrow lifted in small ways.
We boiled down the lies in another pan till they disappeared.
We washed that pan.

They're all worried about you
They think about so many possibilities. 
please cheer up. ? 
.   

You're a very stuborn little girl. .. 

I tried on the farmer's hat, 
Didn't fit- 
A little too small - just a bit 
Too floppy. 
Couldn't get used to it, 
Took it off. 
I tried on the dancer's shoes, 
A little too loose. 
Not the kind you could use 
for walkin'. 
Didn't feel right in 'em, 
Kicked 'em off. 

I tried on the summer sun, 
Felt good. 
Nice and warm - knew it would. 
Tried the grass beneath bare feet, 
Felt neat. 
Finally, finally felt well dressed, 
Nature's clothes fit me best. 

I don't give a damn first order

as events sweep around the world

as long as my family survives.

Then I'll help in any way possible

for we are family of mankind

in humanity's album

with each snapshot

impressed on our soul

begging for relief saying

help me.

Yes.

How

I am a wishful savior 
Give anything to save us
I am a slave to your beauty
Not in control of my lust

You put a spear through my heart
Telling me all that is lost
And splintered down lie my limbs
As I hung from the Cross

But I will still die for you
And cleanse away our sins
I will wear a crown of thorns
Hoping one day our hearts make amends

Until that glorious day
I shall lock myself away
Close myself in with a stone
Until your warmth comes and I won’t feel all alone

For you I shall stay here forever
Until eternity comes to reflect
Awaiting our love that once was 
To resurrect


You asked about my feelings, , , 
I did not know what to say, , , 
You said you think of me always, 
I did not know what to feel, , , 
Hiding my tears, , trying to make it disappear.  

Roselva says the only thing that doesn’t change   
is train tracks. She’s sure of it.
The train changes, or the weeds that grow up spidery   
by the side, but not the tracks.
I’ve watched one for three years, she says,
and it doesn’t curve, doesn’t break, doesn’t grow.

Peter isn’t sure. He saw an abandoned track
near Sabinas, Mexico, and says a track without a train   
is a changed track. The metal wasn’t shiny anymore.   
The wood was split and some of the ties were gone.

Every Tuesday on Morales Street
butchers crack the necks of a hundred hens.   
The widow in the tilted house
spices her soup with cinnamon.
Ask her what doesn’t change.

Stars explode.
The rose curls up as if there is fire in the petals.   
The cat who knew me is buried under the bush.

The train whistle still wails its ancient sound   
but when it goes away, shrinking back
from the walls of the brain,
it takes something different with it every time. 

This time, I have left my body behind me, crying
In its dark thorns.
Still,
There are good things in this world.
It is dusk.
It is the good darkness
Of women's hands that touch loaves.
The spirit of a tree begins to move.
I touch leaves.
I close my eyes and think of water. 

In a world where all
Are hunched and lathered
I know only one
Equal to me in strength.

In a world where we
Seek so much,
I know only one
Equal to me in might.

In a world where everything
Is mold and vines,
I know: only
You are equal in essence

To me. 

for everything
is it the magic in you? 
is it the magic in me? 
what brought out the flood of thought? 
day and night whether am out or not
am marveling at what you're offering


remember
first week of January I arrived here and worry
will I make it? will I not? 
shall I blend in my own mound? 
or let my system absorb it and gauge it
measure the rhythm apply it bit by bit


hello passengers! 
people of the world, welcome aboard! 
how colorful and vibrant, resourceful and expectant
this city, this melting pot, accommodates all sort
have no fear just be a dear
and venture into a rewarding adventure


remind yourself
analyze and understand the substance you had
in your country from your own ancestry
all kinds of strife cutting you like a knife
which uprooted your solid ground
drove you here to a city full of opportunity


Abu Dhabi! 
beautiful host engulfs you at a cost
present your expertise stand by to release
first lesson respect the person
for he matters with all the warts
watch and learn so you govern

your journey
which begins to encompass others
unfolds itself taking you through winding turf
attune to the mood for the common good
as you undertake a task to get paid and bask
in the ambiance of the communal acceptance

you do realize
when you interact you share universal fact
you denounce oneness to thrive in wholeness
I urge you to face challenges of the place
do your best till it is time to rest
I will say it once again to make sure you bargain
you give and receive it is easy to perceive






I was at my divine labor, upon the rock 
Swelling with Pride. From a distance, 
At dawn, some bright petal came to me, 
Some kiss in the night. Upon the rock, 
Tenacious a madwoman, I clung to my work. 

When your voice, like a sacred bell, 
A celestial note with a human tremor, 
Stretched its golden lasso from the edge of your mouth; 

—Marvelous nest of vertigo, your mouth! 
Two rose petals fastened to an abyss-— 

Labor, labor of glory, painful and frivolous; 
Fabric where my spirit went weaving herself! 
You come to the arrogant head of the rock, 

And I fall, without end, into the bloody abyss








You Would Take the Whole World to Bed with You

You would take the whole world to bed with you, 
Impure woman! Ennui makes your soul cruel; 
To exercise your teeth at this singular game, 
You need a new heart in the rack each day. 
Your eyes, brilliant as shop windows 
Or as blazing lamp-stands at public festivals, 
Insolently use a borrowed power 
Without ever knowing the law of their beauty.

Blind, deaf machine, fecund in cruelties! 
Remedial instrument, drinker of the world's blood, 
Why are you not ashamed and why have you not seen 
In every looking-glass how your charms are fading? 
Why have you never shrunk at the enormity 
Of this evil at which you think you are expert, 
When Nature, resourceful in her hidden designs, 
Of you, vile animal, — to fashion a genius?

O foul magnificence! Sublime ignominy!



You'd Stick the World into Your Bedside Lane 

You'd stick the world into your bedside lane. 
It's boredom makes you callous to all pain. 
To exercise your teeth for this strange task, 
A heart upon a rake, each day, you'd ask. 
Your eyes lit up like shopfronts, or the trees 
With lanterns on the night of public sprees, 
Make insolent misuse of borrowed power 
And scorn the law of beauty that's their dower.

Oh deaf-and-dumb machine, harm-breeding fool 
World sucking leech, yet salutary tool! 
Have you not seen your beauties blanch to pass 
Before their own reflection in the glass? 
Before this pain, in which you think you're wise, 
Does not its greatness shock you with surprise, 
To think that Nature, deep in projects hidden, 
Has chosen you, vile creature of the midden, 
To knead a genius for succeeding time.

O sordid grandeur! Infamy sublime!



Tyranny of Woman

Aye, you would bed with the whole universe, 
Lewd woman! Ennui makes your soul perverse; 
Cruel, you whet your teeth at this weird play, 
You need a fresh heart in the rack each day. 
Your eyes blaze like illumined shops or lights 
Of serried lamps on festive public nights,
They use a borrowed puissance haughtily 
Unconscious of their beauty's tyranny.

Blind, deaf machine, geared to increase man's pain, 
Tool primed to suckle blood from his last vein, 
Have you no shame when every looking glass 
Betrays your faded beauties as you pass, 
When cunning Nature's hidden plans begin 
To fashion genius in carnality?

O shameless might! Sublime ignominy!





You'd Take the Entire Universe to Bed with You

You'd take the entire universe to bed with you, 
I think, just out of boredom, you lecherous, idle shrew!
You need, to keep your teeth sound, exercise your jaws, 
Daily, for dinner, some new heart between your paws! 
Your eyes, all lighted up like shops, like public fairs, 
How insolent they are! — as if their power were theirs 
Indeed! — this borrowed power, this Beauty, you direct 
And use, whose law, however, you do not suspect.

Unwholesome instrument for health, O deaf machine 
And blind, fecund in tortures! — how is it you have not seen, 
You drinker of the world's blood, your mirrored loveliness 
Blench and recoil? how is it you feel no shame? confess: 
Has never, then, this evil's very magnitude 
Caused you to stagger? — you, who think yourself so shrewd 
In evil? — seeing how Nature, patient and abstruse — 
Of you, to mould a genius? — employed you all this time?

O muddy grandeur! — ignominy ironic and sublime!





The tube lift mounts,
                                sap in a stem,
And blossoms its load,
                                   a black, untidy rose.

The fountain of the escalator
                              curls at the crest,
                                                   breaks and scatters
A winnow of men,
                           a sickle of dark spray.


'Up, down, good, bad,' said
the man with the tubes
up his nose, ' there's lots
of variety-
However, notions
of balance between
extremes of fortune
are stupid—or at
best unobservant.'
He watched as the nurse
fed pellets into
the green nozzle that
stuck from his side. 'Mm,'
said the man. ' Good. Yum.
(Next time more basil-)
When a long-desired
baby is born, what
joy! More happiness
than we find in sex,
more than we take in
success, revenge, or
wealth. But should the same
infant die, would you
measure the horror
on the same rule? Grief
weighs down the seesaw;
joy cannot budge it.'

           'When I was nineteen,
I told a thirty-
year-old man what a
fool I had been when
I was seventeen.
'We were always,' he
said glancing down, 'a
fool two years ago.''

           The man with the tubes
up his nostrils spoke
carefully: 'I don't
regret what I did,
but that I claimed I
did the opposite.
If I was faithless
or treacherous and
cowardly, I had
my reasons—but I
regret that I called
myself loyal, brave,
and honorable.'

           'Of all illusions,'
said the man with the 
tubes up his nostrils,
IVs, catheter,
and feeding nozzle,
'the silliest one
was hardest to lose.
For years I supposed
that after climbing
exhaustedly up
with pitons and ropes,
I would arrive at
last on the plateau
of walking-level-
forever-among-
moss-with-red -blossoms.
But of course, of course:
A continual
climbing is the one
form of arrival
we ever come to—
unless we suppose
that the wished-for height
and house of desire
is tubes up the nose.

'Who did build this silken nest
On this prickly mountain plant
Swaying in the vagrant winds
On this Tucson canyon ridge? 

Architect of wilderness! 
Am told you don’t return home
Till after the sun has gone
By when canyon trips are closed

Google searches failed to tell
Who could such a home belong
You a trogon, towhee, finch
Warbler, redstart, humming bird? 

With stripes on a fluffy chest
Picked from rainbows at sunset? 
Do you have a crown on head
Wagging tail of golden plumes? 

Are your eyes mascara-lined
Black and dark by new moon night? 
Are they of a crimson tone
Shaded bright by blushful dawn? 

Don’t you sing like nightingales? 
Do you trill and thrill the hills? 
Unknown friend of earth and sky
Sweet conjecture all this mine

I can see you deep in nest
Eyes in rest with head in chest
Lighted by the lady moon
Fumbling with her starry gown

Is that so my little friend
Haven’t you drunk the world too in
Starry expanse, nest and moon
Wind and night and everything? 

When you sleep the world does cease
It nests in you one with you
Why does then a fool like me
Indulge in a guessing game? 

Why I ponder how you look
When I too am within you
One with you and never apart
Myself am the bird you are? 

Made of rapture full of song
Rainbow wings to soar aloft
To boundless freedom at last
Where time and space stand aghast


Who did build this silken nest
On this prickly mountain plant
Swaying in the vagrant winds
On this Tucson canyon ridge? 

Architect of wilderness! 
Am told you don’t return home
Till after the sun has gone
By when canyon trips are closed

Google searches failed to tell
Who could such a home belong
You a trogon, towhee, finch
Warbler, redstart, humming bird? 

With stripes on a fluffy chest
Picked from rainbows at sunset? 
Do you have a crown on head
Wagging tail of golden plumes? 

Are your eyes mascara-lined
Black and dark by new moon night? 
Are they of a crimson tone
Shaded bright by blushful dawn? 

Don’t you sing like nightingales? 
Do you trill and thrill the hills? 
Unknown friend of earth and sky
Sweet conjecture all this mine

I can see you deep in nest
Eyes in rest with head in chest
Lighted by the lady moon
Fumbling with her starry gown

Is that so my little friend
Haven’t you drunk the world too in
Starry expanse, nest and moon
Wind and night and everything? 

When you sleep the world does cease
It nests in you one with you
Why does then a fool like me
Indulge in a guessing game? 

Why I ponder how you look
When I too am within you
One with you and never apart
Myself am the bird you are? 

Made of rapture full of song
Rainbow wings to soar aloft
To boundless freedom at last
Where time and space stand aghast


Betwixt a crimson west of sunset
Rainbow-crowned thunder cloud on the east
Swept by ferocious gales
Lay Tucson waiting
Her locks scattered
Her feet on the north 
On the Catalina mounts
Head pillowed on Santa Rita
Voluptuous, for her mate, the sky to descend

As mesquites, palo verdes, oaks, figs, acacia
Waved their heads in demoniac dance
Lighted by an unearthly shine
As though possessed by the elements
An evening was about to gasp its last

And then it came in a clatter
The sky with fingers of rain
Stoked her insanity as she giggled
In puddles and streams
As the Rillito swelled in orgasmic passion
Oh, what a beautiful night it was to begin! 

And what happened then
To the luminescent fig beetles
Delicate dragon flies
Arizona sister butterflies
That throng the sunny days
Of Tucson’s breeze and glitter? 

Don’t ask stupid mind
She is a mother, she knows
She had them hidden safe
Under her locks
As the sky stoked and stoked
And as she giggled without end
That beautiful rainy night
Tucson, the ma nonpareil

I’m the man to be, 
cos I’m me, me, me; 
but you’re just you
and who cares who

I’m the greatest, 
I could be the hatest, 
you’re down on your luck
but I don’t care a  ****, 

life is tough, 
an’ life is rough, 
but that’s enuff
who cares a stuff

I don’ need to write
cos ed-u-cation’s shite; 
I jus’ like to spray
my mark somewhere each day

I score the chix, 
I score a fix, 
me an’ you don’t mix
cos I know the trix

I’m the koolest gangsta, 
you, you’re just a wanksta, 
my posse an’ me
hand out cruel-tyy

I got a shooter
you ain’t worth a hoota; 
I got a knife, 
you ain’t got a life

I gotta switch, man -
ain’t your life a bitch? 
I gotta blade, man -
got it all made

ain’t no lovin’
like my ho an’ me..




I played chess the other day. At Tuesday wasn’t it? 
With you. On my mind, that is, as I was playing against
him – this gentleman with more history than future, I sensed.
That night, this silent battle felt as being a prolonged sit, 

full of starling delight. While persistently hustling
for a stable interpose, his black pawns were marching boldly
ahead without any fear – an impressive but dangerous habit

in my experience. It was until my bishop, located at G 
so warlike and stout, whispered your beautiful name.
Your explicit – but hidden – sign to ignite me for true war, 

for cruising to triumph – squeezing the meanest of mates.
But then my dear, you got careless I must say. I lost the soul
of the play. Or was it you, already in desperate straits




It was reported the sky split in two
Hot winds embraced the surrounding areas
The earth shook from a blast an air burst - blew
Measuring,on the Richter scale tables.

June by Tunguska River
An explosion knocked down some million trees
Flattening km(sq. miles)   not a briar
Remained or stood not a single tree breezed

It was said an asteroid or comet
With the power of a (M-tons TNT)  
Exploded before impact into soot
Luckily hitting there not society.

Again just last year watched on-line mesmerized 
Comets screeched on screens a fear globalized. 

Anger is more useful then despair
Dont cry your eyes out or pull out your hair
Smash someones head in with a wooden chair
Anger is more useful than despair
Do you think i really care? 
Cant you see? I've laid myself bare
Please observe my frozen stare
Then look inside me if you dare. 

Only ate one drumstick
At the picnic dance this summer,
Just one little drumstick--
They say I couldn't be dumber.
One tough and skinny drumstick,
Why was that such a bummer?
But everybody's mad at me,
Especially the drummer. 

the child runs and plays
while the man works hard everyday
the child is carefree
while the man works hard for his degree
what is different is
the child can turn the clock forward when it wishes to
but the man cannot turn back time when it yearns to


Turn Off The Sound

Turn off the sound of your darken voice 
those late night dances keeps me on my feet
I hang up the telephone when you call 
just be here with me when I fall, 

I like the rain when it falls on my skin
I like the sounds of the ravens 
I like the kisses you gave 
I love the moans of your body 
when it touches mine
It hurts me, 

when I never see, you smile 
You taken the light out of my world 
We get so disconnected
like light and day
You are my favorite place
when I see love in your eyes, 

but yeah, we're so disconnected
I want to feel your breath up and down back
I want to fix your broken smile
and put love back in your heart 
I love you 
I learn so much from you
you lie and I try not to 
But I want more from you.





Have eyed dire a life packed with storms.
Wildly, money whisked in air-vast sums, 
Pains my home with intense heart drums.

All but tears, my wife flooding alone.
To my kids, I’m of tramp-trash tone.
Love to light them ought to be shown.

To discard not my heart-dear ones, 
Must stamp a stop to gambling runs, 
Must exit out those gulping funs.

Life adrift I have dwelled, I burn.
To a life spring-solaced, I turn.
Sun-living with my home, I earn. 


Oh, I want to turn 
but I know not too
I want to dance 
in a life of romance 
among the rain 
but all I got was the pains
Oh, how my mind 
keeps playing back to those 
sad lonely days 
I know not to turn 
while the cold autumn wind blow
I turned 
You had been standing there tall 
You taken me in your heart 
we turned 
we dance among the rain 
we dance in a life time of romance 
that has roved the pains 
of those sad lonely days
Oh, We turned for Love
Turned I 'm glad we did.





The barroom mirror lit up with our wives   
has faded to a loaded-to-the-gills
Japanese subcompact, little lives
asleep behind us, heading for the hills

in utter darkness through invisible
countryside we know by heart by light;   
but woods that are humane and hospitable   
often turn eerie on a moonless night.

Our talk is quiet: the week’s triumphs, failings,   
gossip, memories—but largely fears.
In our brief repertoire of poses ailing’s
primary, and more so with the years

now every step seems haunted by the future,   
not only ours, but all that they will face:
a stricter world, with scarceness for a teacher,   
bad air, bad water, no untrammeled space

or so it seems to us, after the Fall,
but for the young the world is always new.   
Maybe that’s what dates us worst of all
and saves them: What we’ll miss they never knew.

We’re old enough now to be old enough,
to know what loss is—not just hair and breath;   
each has eyeballed reality by now:
a rift, a failure, or a major death.

They landed on us; we were not consulted,   
although our darkest yearnings aren’t so deep.   
Let’s tick off the short wish list of adulthood:   
sleep, honor, sleep, love, riches, sleep, and sleep . . .

and camaraderie, that warms the blood,   
the mildest, most forgiving form of love.   
In an uncertain world a certain good
is one who’ll laugh off what you’re leery of.

That’s why we’re out here, racing with the clock   
through cold and darkness: so that, glass in hand,   
we’ll face our half-life, padded for the shock   
by a few old souls who understand.

Now the odometer, uncompromising,   
shows all its nines’ tails hanging in the air.   
Now an entire row of moons is rising,   
rising, rising, risen—we are there:

Total Maturity. The trick is how
to amortize remorse, desire, and dread.   
Eyes ahead, companions: Life is Now.   
The serious years are opening ahead. 


If my sorrow were deeper
I'd be, along with you, under
the ocean's floor; 
but today I learn that the oil
that pools beneath the ocean floor
is essence
residue
remains
of all our
relations
all
our ancestors who have died and turned to oil
without our witness
eons ago.
We've always belonged to them.


Speaking for you, hanging, weeping, 
over the water's edge
as well as for myself.
It is our grief
heavy, relentless,
trudging
us, however resistant,
to the decaying and rotten
bottom of things:
our grief bringing
us home. 


Rolling space gentle mild
Olives plucked by a child

Wandering slow Tuscan knolls
Fluttering fleeced golden dolls

Blooming begonias on the sill
autumnal hues the eyes still 

hopeful smile of flourishing dells
grand old church's peeling bells

slanted roofs with ruddy tiles
as one whiles away the miles

lapping waves in near by coves
fruiting berries in shady groves

slush slosh of seaside waves
trickling salt in glowing caves

Flitting pigeons in their droves
whatever piazza that one goes

serene heaven in sheltered bays
welcome advance of waterways

silent days and greedy nights
unwrinkled shine of satin whites

so much hope of golden days
lost to dither in faltering ways




Cisterns and stones; the fig-tree in the wall
Casts down her shadow, ashen as her boughs,
Across the road, across the thick white dust.
Down from the hill the slow white oxen crawl,
Dragging the purple waggon heaped with must,
With scarlet tassels on their milky brows,
Gentle as evening moths. Beneath the yoke
Lounging against the shaft they fitful strain
To draw the waggon on its creaking spoke,
And all the vineyard folk
With staves and shouldered tools surround the wain.
The wooden shovels take the purple stain,
The dusk is heavy with the wine's warm load; 
Here the long sense of classic measure cures
The spirit weary of its difficult pain; 
Here the old Bacchic piety endures,
Here the sweet legends of the world remain.
Homeric waggons lumbering the road; 
Virgilian litanies among the bine; 
Pastoral sloth of flocks beneath the pine; 
The swineherd watching, propped upon his goad,
Urder the chestnut trees the rootling swine
Who could so stand, and see this evening fall,
This calm of husbandry, this redolent tilth,
This terracing of hills, this vintage wealth,
Without the pagan sanity of blood
Mounting his veins in young and tempered health? 
Whu could so stand, and watch processional
The vintners, herds, and flocks in dusty train
Wend through the golden evening to regain
The terraced farm and trodden threshing-floor
Where late the flail
Tossed high the maize in scud of gritty ore,
And lies half-buried in the heap of grain
Who could so watch, and not forget the rack
Of wills worn thin and thought become too frail,
Nor roll the centuries back *
And feel the sinews of his soul grow hale,
And know himself for Rome's inheritor

Telly, flex your media might!  Bring
Vistas of our worldly plight.



To hear the living Clock - 
A short relief to have the wind
Walk boldly up and knock - 
Diversion from the Dying Theme
To hear the children play - 
But wrong the more
That these could live
And this of ours must die.



and all through the woods, 
The bunnies were busy
packing their goods.
The eggs were all colored
so pretty and bright, 
All things were 'go'
for the big, special night.

The baskets were waiting, 
all decorated with care, 
In hopes that the Bunny
soon would be there.
My little brother Sam
was asleep in his bed, 
While visions of Easter eggs
rolled round his head.

And I in my pajamas
with the cat on my lap, 
I had just settled down
for a quick little nap.
When outside the window
I heard a great noise, 
I sprang from my chair
and jumped over some toys.

As quick as a flash
to the window I flew, 
I pulled up the shade
and, OH, what a view.
The moon on the meadow
cast a bright golden glow
And the wind blew the flowers
to and then fro.

Then all of a sudden
from out of nowhere, 
Came some lively bunnies, 
hopping here, hopping there! 
Leading the group
with ears long and funny
Was a plump, all-white rabbit.  
That's right.  



The bunnies hopped past, 
one, two, three, four, 
The rabbit called out
and then there were more.
'Come, Peter! , Come, Flopsy! , 
Come, Benny! , Come, Joe! 
Now hop along! Hop along! Hop along! GO! '


So up on each doorstep
the bunnies did hop, 
With baskets of eggs.
(Let's hope they don't drop) ! 
Just at that moment, 
on the porch down below, 
Came the stomping of feet
'Twas the rabbit, I know! 

As I stepped from my window
I heard a loud sound.
Through the door came the rabbit
with a leap and a bound.
He was furry and soft
from his head to his feet.
To see him so close
was really quite neat.

He was surrounded by eggs
that had been carefully dyed.
Easter eggs galore he soon would hide.
His eyes were all twinkles, 
His nose was so pink, 
And I can't be too sure, 
but I think he did wink.

He had a kind face
and a big fluffy tail
That bobbed up and down
like a boat with a sail.
A twitch of his nose
and a flick of his ear
Was his way of saying, 
'You've nothing to fear.'


He uttered no sound
as he hopped all about
Hiding the eggs and leaving no doubt, 
That the Easter bunny had come
like he does every year. 
Bringing baskets of happiness
to children so dear.


'Twas warm—at first—like Us—
Until there crept upon
A Chill—like frost upon a Glass—
Till all the scene—be gone.

The Forehead copied Stone—
The Fingers grew too cold
To ache—and like a Skater's Brook—
The busy eyes—congealed—

It straightened—that was all—
It crowded Cold to Cold—
It multiplied indifference—
As Pride were all it could—

And even when with Cords—
'Twas lowered, like a Weight—
It made no Signal, nor demurred,
But dropped like Adamant. 


Mother, I do want to leave off my lessons now. I have been at my
book all the morning.
    You say it is only twelve o'clock. Suppose it isn't any later;
can't you ever think it is afternoon when it is only twelve
o'clock?
    I can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of
that rice-field, and the old fisher-woman is gathering herbs for
her supper by the side of the pond.
    I can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing
darker under the madar tree, and the water in the pond looks shiny
black.
    If twelve o'clock can come in the night, why can't the night
come when it is twelve o'clock


Through the house give glimmering light
By the dead and drowsy fire;
Every elf and fairy sprite
hop as light as bird from brier.

Now, until the break of day
Through this house each fairy stray.


Behind partition, 
Days and nights dance madly; 
Twenty first century. 

They check out your sign
, help you combine
, 
While you’re taking a chance
, 
In cyberspace, with virtual satin and lace-, 
This could be the start of a Twenty-First Century Romance.

When Cupid takes aim
, it won’t be in vain-, 
You’ll share the ultimate dance
, 
With no firewall, you’ll have a ball
, 
This could be the start of a Twenty-First Century Romance. .! ! ! 

No matter where you are-, love’s magic creates a trance-,          
From the heart of New York City to Naples, maybe even Paris, France. .., 
This could be the start of a Twenty-First Century Romance
, 
Yes, this could be the start of a Twenty-First Century Romance. 

Twenty-first. Night. Monday.
Silhouette of the capitol in darkness.
Some good-for-nothing -- who knows why--
made up the tale that love exists on earth.

People believe it, maybe from laziness
or boredom, and live accordingly:
they wait eagerly for meetings, fear parting,
and when they sing, they sing about love.

But the secret reveals itself to some,
and on them silence settles down. 
I found this out by accident
and now it seems I'm sick all the time. 

Twenty-four years remind the tears of my eyes.
(Bury the dead for fear that they walk to the grave in labour.)
In the groin of the natural doorway I crouched like a tailor
Sewing a shroud for a journey
By the light of the meat-eating sun.
Dressed to die, the sensual strut begun,
With my red veins full of money,
In the final direction of the elementary town
I advance as long as forever is. 

We came here to Australia
From a place that’s called Sudan
I‘ve got three beautiful children
And a badly damaged man
My youngest child is six years old
And doing oh so well at school
My eldest she is now fifteen
And she says I am a fool
My husband he is trying
To settle in down here
He was an ardent Muslim
Now he seems to like his beer
His English is not good you know
And I know that he does try
But it’s hard here in Australia
Without the Sudan sky
We do not know where we fit in
We’re not welcome on these shores
But back in earth burnt Africa
We could not take no more
My cousin she was raped then burned
My father torn apart
One of my children blown away
Now – you listen to my heart
My pulse is strongly beating
But it bleeds inside for them
We have left that cold, dark continent
And now want to start again
My teenage lovely daughter
Is now active in a gang
She’s rude, aggressive and I fear
She’s for gaol in this land
My husband finds it hard you see
He’s not listened to no more
He has no pride in what he is
And sleeps nightly on the floor
My younger two are all my pride
I try to hold them very near
But how this country treats them
Is something that I fear
Myself? I am above this
I am tall and straight and proud
I just want us here and happy
That is if we are allowed
To get on with life and settle in
To greet each day with hopeful smiles
For why else would a family
Travel twenty thousand miles

You keep me waiting in a truck
with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch,   
while you piss against the south side of a tree.
Hurry. I've got nothing on under my skirt tonight.   
That still excites you, but this pickup has no windows   
and the seat, one fake leather thigh,   
pressed close to mine is cold.   
I'm the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago,   
but get inside me, start the engine;   
you'll have the strength, the will to move.   
I'll pull, you push, we'll tear each other in half.
Come on, baby, lay me down on my back.   
Pretend you don't owe me a thing   
and maybe we'll roll out of here,   
leaving the past stacked up behind us;
old newspapers nobody's ever got to read again. 

Twice a week the winter thorough 
Here stood I to keep the goal: 
Football then was fighting sorrow 
For the young man's soul. 

Now in Maytime to the wicket 
Out I march with bat and pad: 
See the son of grief at cricket 
Trying to be glad. 

Try I will; no harm in trying: 
Wonder 'tis how little mirth 
Keeps the bones of man from lying 
On the bed of earth.Twice had 


Summer her fair Verdure
Proffered to the Plain—
Twice a Winter's silver Fracture
On the Rivers been—

Two full Autumns for the Squirrel
Bounteous prepared—
Nature, Had'st thou not a Berry
For thy wandering Bird



Her scarf a la Bardot, 
In suede flats for the walk, 
She came with me one evening
For air and friendly talk.
We crossed the quiet river, 
Took the embankment walk.

Traffic holding its breath, 
Sky a tense diaphragm: 
Dusk hung like a backcloth
That shook where a swan swam, 
Tremulous as a hawk
Hanging deadly, calm.

A vacuum of need
Collapsed each hunting heart
But tremulously we held
As hawk and prey apart, 
Preserved classic decorum, 
Deployed our talk with art.

Our Juvenilia
Had taught us both to wait, 
Not to publish feeling
And regret it all too late -
Mushroom loves already
Had puffed and burst in hate.

So, chary and excited, 
As a thrush linked on a hawk, 
We thrilled to the March twilight
With nervous childish talk: 
Still waters running deep
Along the embankment walk. 

There were Two Little Bears who lived in a Wood,
And one of them was Bad and the other was Good.
Good Bear learnt his Twice Times One -
But Bad Bear left all his buttons undone.

They lived in a Tree when the weather was hot,
And one of them was Good, and the other was Not.
Good Bear learnt his Twice Times Two -
But Bad Bear's thingummies were worn right through.

They lived in a Cave when the weather was cold,
And they Did, and they Didn't Do, what they were told.
Good Bear learnt his Twice Times Three -
But Bad Bear never had his hand-ker-chee.

They lived in the Wood with a Kind Old Aunt,
And one said 'Yes'm,' and the other said 'Shan't!'
Good Bear learnt his Twice Times Four -
But Bad Bear's knicketies were terrible tore.

And then quite suddenly (just like Us)
One got Better and the other got Wuss.
Good Bear muddled his Twice Times Three -
But Bad Bear coughed in his hand-ker-chee!

Good Bear muddled his Twice Times Two -
But Bad Bear's thingummies looked like new.
Good Bear muddled his Twice Times One -
But Bad Bear never left his buttons undone.

There may be a Moral, though some say not;
I think there's a moral, though I don't know what.
But if one gets better, as the other gets wuss,
These Two Little Bears are just like Us.
But I keep forgetting where I put my pen.*  

* So I have had to write this one in pencil. 

BLASTED with sighs, and surrounded with tears,
Hither I come to seek the spring,
And at mine eyes, and at mine ears,
Receive such balms as else cure every thing.
But O ! self-traitor, I do bring
The spider Love, which transubstantiates all,
And can convert manna to gall ;
And that this place may thoroughly be thought
True paradise, I have the serpent brought.

'Twere wholesomer for me that winter did
Benight the glory of this place,
And that a grave frost did forbid
These trees to laugh and mock me to my face ;
But that I may not this disgrace
Endure, nor yet leave loving, Love, let me
Some senseless piece of this place be ;
Make me a mandrake, so I may grow here,
Or a stone fountain weeping out my year.

Hither with crystal phials, lovers, come,
And take my tears, which are love's wine,
And try your mistress' tears at home,
For all are false, that taste not just like mine.
Alas ! hearts do not in eyes shine,
Nor can you more judge women's thoughts by tears,
Than by her shadow what she wears.
O perverse sex, where none is true but she,
Who's therefore true, because her truth kills me. 

I am here waiting for you in my twilight years
Saying goodbye was very hard to face, 
following our breathless warm embrace.

You are the only one I can hold on to

To fulfill our promises long time ago
It was you, yes you are the only one

Come, and be with me in my twilight years
Wrap my arms, laden with sorrows and pain
Give us another chance to face the sunrise.. 

Yes, long shadows go out
from the bales; and yes, the soul
must part from the body:
what else could it do?

The men sprawl near the baler, 
too tired to leave the field.
They talk and smoke,
and the tips of their cigarettes
blaze like small roses 
in the night air. (It arrived
and settled among them
before they were aware.)

The moon comes 
to count the bales,
and the dispossessed--
Whip-poor-will, Whip-poor-will
--sings from the dusty stubble.

These things happen. . . 

the soul's bliss
and suffering are bound together
like the grasses. . .

The last, sweet exhalations
of timothy and vetch
go out with the song of the bird; 
the ravaged field
grows wet with dew. 

In every hue of sunset, 
the only one I know

is tinged with twilight blue
of time in afterglow.

All memories are blue, 
all dawns are tinted pink.

But as the day is ending, 
I need no doublethink.

The victories have faded
to mark the close of day.

And time reveals a shade
of bittersweet dismay.

And so I must resign
the struggle and the strain, 

and send a gentle prayer, 
to free me from this pain. 

I love the hour that comes, with dusky hair 
And dewy feet, along the Alpine dells
To lead the cattle forth. A thousand bells 
Go chiming after her across the fair 
And flowery uplands, while the rosy flare
Of sunset on the snowy mountain dwells,
And valleys darken, and the drowsy spells 
Of peace are woven through the purple air. 

Dear is the magic of this hour: she seems
To walk before the dark by falling rills,
And lend a sweeter song to hidden streams;
She opens all the doors of night, and fills
With moving bells the music of my dreams,
That wander far among the sleeping hills. 

It's been a while
since I have watched
the evening settle in and fill
the silence up with darkness.
It comes the same however; 
too long I've stayed outdoors.
I turn and watch my shadow
reaching out toward night
that silently pours through trees
a mile away. My homeward
walk will find me in the dark
before the backyard gate swings to
and startled dogs begin to bark.
A thousand limbs
that scraped my face
and just as many spider webs
I failed to see, you'd think
should make me watch the time.
But twilight's steady tow, 
however rare it may have been, 
will find a mind with too much on it
and holds me in the growing dark
to tally up the worth today
of what was done
and what was yet to do. 

Stars in the candle light, dined
Swallowed fires on solitary twilight sky
My eyes asked and dreamt 
Under the smoke of star studded night
What happened to those times? 
Was it turned to ash and joined the dust? 
Was it washed away by the kiss of distrust? 
Wasted dew drops evaporated on the garden 
Of never, O never, never land


d Of December,wilight, Twilight
Flying Faster into the night
so fast so bright can't see the night

Twilight, Twilight
I can't keep up

Twilight, Twilight
What a fright, delight

Twilight, Twilight
Daybreak, daynight
moonstruck, down to the ground

Twilight, Twilight
Tonight, tonight we get it right tonight.

Twilight, Twilight

FOOLHARDINESS

Pygmies rummaging the armoury
Of giants, contending for blazonry
That won’t fit in their repertory! 

ANTICIPATION

A wait at a midnight street
With eyes poised to the East
To catch the first shafts of light


SUICIDE

When all is ill
And reason still
Impulse yells ‘kill’

EUTHANASIA
 
When life is woe
And the world says ‘go’
The grave beckons ‘come’ANTIQUITY

Then apple and blackberry were just fruits
And people ate an apple everyday
To keep the apothecary away
 
MODERNITY

Now Apple and Black berry eat the people
While chatting and twittering with faceless souls
Day in and day out, all round the clock


FIDELTY

With lethal liquid in the syringe
As he approached his aged, mangy dog
Lying still n’ waiting summons, it wagged its tail

BETRAYAL

Life sap drained to the dregs for her children
Now she, in their eyes ‘an old hag’
They dumped the ‘trash’ into the waste bin

LIFE

Precious and priceless
But gradually weakens and withers
And opens the door to death

DEATH

Dreadful and unpredictable
At once disconnecting and conjoining
And opens the door to life


Infinity

Parallel lines stretching, stretching, ing.. 

ng-g! 
Neither made to intersect
Nor meant to pause

Hope

A rain cloud suspended
Between the vault of heaven above
And the parched land below


Said, Never Lived! 


 'I LOVE YOU'
An over stated expression
But an under lived experience! 



My Littleness

Creator of the universe
How little I am before you



MOMENTS

They flash into our midst in a twinkle
To seize them in our hold, as we scrabble, 
They glide into eternity like a trickle

ORPHAN

Man and woman in unity begot
Soon in discord forgot
Now a castaway sans either's support


A PILGRIM

A tramp in the eternal quest after love
Halting in and moving out from shrine to shrine
Until he merges with Love beyond all shades and sheen

STARS

Celestial wayfarers of the night
Dancing damsels with the light
Fading phantoms at Phoebes' sight


SWEET MEMORIES

Dazzling rainbows in a cloud ridden mind
The elusive spectrums of varying wavelengths
Often appearing after a sunny drizzle of happy episodes


SOUR MEMORIES

Fossilized cadavers
Unable to be cremated or buried
Refusing to disintegrate into oblivion


SUSPICION

A centipede, surreptitiously crawling
With a hundred legs, listlessly crawling


crawling
Until from a covert hide out, it suddenly stings


JEALOUSY

If you rail relentless
Seeing others thrive prosperous
It is jealousy, doubtless

The shining star so far above
Twinkle signs of twinkle love, 

So to the star blow your flying kisses
To your love who is your Mrs
 

For it is such a sure fire winner
For you to come home to your
              hot dinner.

please tell me how you are
I see you always in smiling face
never saw your wrathing face
never do you quarrel amongst yourselves
although you are in multi face
but we the people of this earth
quarrel together days and night
preach us the lesson you've got
to dwell together in love and peace, 

Also preach us the lesson
to glow in the darkest night
and to jubilate with eternal light.


Twinkle twinkle little star
please tell me how you are

Twinkle  twinkle little star
how i imagine how you are? 

my poetic mind imagine the moment
when there was not your existance
you must be trembling to appear in sky
from Almighty's divine soul
tell me his first advice
when you were one in night
was there any like Adam and Eve
to give birth of star child
and thereby to spread over the sky
like  Adam and Eve increased their race
covered the earth leaving no space


Twinkle  twinkle little star
how i imagine how you are 

Twinkle twinkle  little star  
I am amazed to see your light

when the sun has gone out of sky
and moon has come in the sky
then you glow with your silvery light
how can i imagine any night
when you hide in the sky
what moon will think 
without your twinkling light
how the sky will look
in a starless night

Twinkle twinkle little star
you twinkle throughout night

Twinkle twinkle  little star  
I am amazed to see your light


When the sun
Shines through the leaves of the apple-tree,
When the sun
Makes shadows of the leaves of the apple-tree,
Then I pass
On the grass
From one leaf to another,
From one leaf to its brother,
Tip-toe, tip-toe!
Here I go


Beautiful diamond twinkles
in the sunlight, 
Showing how much powerful 
beauty it has.

Diamond rings for men and
for women, 
Shows how much diamonds stand
out perfectly, 
A diamond always has a perfect
place to suit almost anyone, 
Especially, upon that special
finger.

A diamond never fades or never 
turns dull, 
It keeps that sparkling shine as
if to say, 
'Hello, everyone look at me.' 
As it shines beautifully like a 
twinkling star.


You may also say a diamond has a  
glitter effect, 
Just like glitters sparkle and 
shine, 
A diamond has a similar glittery
look as well.

A diamond is meant forever, 
Something to cherish always, 
Very much like an everlasting
treasure filled with love.

Diamonds will always be an endless
beauty, 
Forever surrounding you with its
twinkling love, 
Always and forever and eternally. 


Twist ye, twine ye! even so,
Mingle shades of joy and woe,
Hope, and fear, and peace, and strife,
In the thread of human life.

While the mystic twist is spinning,
And the infant's life beginning,
Dimly seen through twilingt bending,
Lo, what varied shapes attending!

Passions wild, and follies vain,
Pleasures soon exchanged for pain;
Dount, and jealousy, and fear,
In the magic dance appear.

Now they wax, and now they dwindle,
Whirling with the whirling spindle.
Twist ye, twine ye! even so,
Mingle human bliss and woe.

Devoted to pleasures perfidious strange 
Carry S/M*** to a demented derange, 
Spell fallacies, fantasies with a capital P 
Trite, deem, boundaries of he or she 
Devoted to pleasures a la hedonic thrills 
Epicurean pleasures and androgynous frills 
Feminists or masculists in acrimony, acrophony

Misandrous lives of unending indulgent delight 
Feminists fear misogynists in absent fright 
Sexual fetishism and its fanciful flights 
Diehard followers swear by its heights 
Masochistic flights, of "Venus in Furs" *
"The Story of O"** with its demeaning slurs 
Dona* willingly closets in a chateau's den 
Soaks orgies of mistreat by a group of men. 
fetishists with aura of erotica in sundry 
Leading to yet more enigmatic quandary 
misogynism alive as a political theology

Female lovers, justify Alimony? 
What then, the burden of progeny? 
Misogyny, Phylogeny, all here thrive. 
Masochistic amorists ail, keen, contrive. 
Fetishist fanciers stiletto striken survive 
Single blessedness I say is the best 
A great lover of women has it attest 


This life we have lived
the breath of time we let go
we strived to take and give
huddling deeply in the dense packed snow

It is us who yearns for words
that means what they seem
some can be quite absurd
but it is I who is the feign

Twisted words screeching to a stop
the contorted mind befuddled in awe
as they fall plop plop plop
just like the glistening rain falling under the stars

Words we choose over thought
can cause you to lose your breath without a glance 
and suddenly you know that you have caught
the flowers blooming wildly in your mind was just by chance


A woman that I need not name tweeted
Multiple disparaging assertions
To the first president-elect to tweet
His political declarations.

She had her right to her free speech
And this right should not be stopped.
But now she's mad that he is free, 
And from his Twitter page she's blocked.

People like her are tweeting everywhere, 
Foaming at the mouth like they had rabies.
But the author Doug Giles has a solution: 
"A Coloring Book for College Cry-Babies"


The steam hammer pounds with a regularity on steel I should envy.
Neither the hammer nor the steel seems to be suffering from this
terrible meeting between them, proving something vaguely pointed,
that some things must be done, regardless of cost, and finally the
cost too is absorbed in the doing that has become a ritual between
two fated opponents. 

Let me find time
to welcome in this love
that comes unbid.
Let me find time
to memorize
this face that rises
out of the trees
of forgetfulness.
Give me the time
to escape this love
that stops my blood.
Let me find time
to recognize your name,
my name,
and the place
where I was born.
Let me find time
to know where I shall die
and how I will revive, as
a bird inside your eyes.
Let me find time
to study the state of winds
and waves, to learn the maps
of bays.


Woman, who lodges
inside the future
pepper and pomegranate-seeds,
give me a country
to make me forget all countries,
and give me time
to avoid this Andalusian face,
this Andalusian voice,
this Andalusian death
coming from all directions.
Let me find time to prophesy
the coming of the flood.

Woman, who was inscribed
in books of magic,
before you came
the world was prose.
Now poetry is born.
Give me the time to catch
the colt that runs toward me,
your breast.
The dot over a line.
A bedouin breast, sweet
as cardamom seeds
as coffee brewing over embers,
its form ancient as Damascene brass
as Egyptian temples.


Let me find luck
to pick the fish that swim
under the waters.

Your feet on the carpet
are the shape and stance
of poetry.

Let me find the luck
to know the dividing line
between the certainty
of love and heresy.
Give me the opportunity
to be convinced I have seen
the star, and have been spoken to
by saints.


Woman, whose thighs are like
the desert palm where golden
dates fall from,
your breasts speak seven tongues
and I was made to listen
to them all.
Give me the chance
to avoid this storm,
this sweeping love,
this wintry air, and to be convinced,
to blaspheme, and to enter
the flesh of things.
Give me the chance
to be the one
to walk on water. 


Piano notes drip 
like raindrops in puddles
Lightning splacks and cracks outside


   A Haiku can be a mirror

   In only three sad lines


Though we both lay here together
  we're a hundred worlds apart
 different memories; different demons
different Spirits; different Hearts

Though we may embrace each other
Eternally, we stay alone
   Though we both lay here together
we're just two autumn leaves
 the wind has blown. 


I saw them flying, they were a pair.
I picture them dying they were in fear.
That was the perception I had in my mind.
I had it all figured out! 	
It was an early morning with daunted orange sky.
Why were there just only two bothering birds? 

They always wore the same outfit each and every time.
At the same places together them you'll find.
Everyone I knew admired their charisma.
But I dishonored their pompous behavior.
They were just too cocky for bothering birds.
Every other birds I knew were gentle and peaceful.
Well, why were they so proud? 

I'm a dealer, I'm renowned as the big bird killer. 
I like chicken, turkey, goose and duck.
But these two birds were pure bad luck.
Mama always await my catch, she just love to see what bird I may bring home next.
Yea, she's my number one chef, she help me skin those filthy feathers.
As I stroll outside in curiosity, I again came across those bothering birds.
They were performing at the local karaoke.
Their voices were amusingly innocent. 
Why do the bad birds sing? 

I left quite a bit early to meet up with my friend Mr. Flingshot.
He knows all the tricks and all the traps.
When I'm out of ideas he whispers me a few hints.
His hints have always been an inspiration, it always seemed to work.
Yes, he is quite a talent.
With his help I was able to devise a plan.
I was going to catch these two bothering birds once and for all
Now where do I start? 

I rushed back to mom's.  She couldn't wait to arrange the plates.
She hugged me so tightly thus trying to help build my confidence, I was ready for yet another catch.
The very same night, I went back to the market place where the two bothering birds usually hang out.
It was as though they have somehow changed feathers again.
Short cocked up tails, with shorter-like beaks, it was as though their body were covered with silk, their feathers laid down so smoothly.
Mr. Flingshort has given me some bate to use, to try to entice those bothering birds.
They were flirty and hungry! 
As I threw the first bate, the first bothering bird wagged her tail and the second took deep inhales.
When I threw the second, they got so afraid and flew off.
But why did they flew? 

Birds of same feather surely flock together.
I could've gotten them both with one stone if and only if they've stayed around.
Unfortunately, they've flown to the next side of the town.
These bothering birds were just too experienced. 
My quest to taste some new breasts have been deterred.
Anyways, I prefer my everyday chicken, turkey, goose and duck.
To hell with those bothering birds! 
Why did I even bother


Two butterflies went out at noon
And waltzed above a stream,
Then stepped straight through the firmament
And rested on a beam;

And then together bore away
Upon a shining sea,--
Though never yet, in any port
Their coming mentioned be.

If spoken by the distant bird,
If met in ether sea
By frigate or by merchantman,
Report was not to me. 

Two cats look at each other
They see each other through a glass door
The gray cat is inside looking out
The white cat is outside looking in.

One cat starts meowing
The other cat meows in replying.
Both cats are meowing
Who understands what they're saying? 

One cat meows again
While rubbing its snout on the glass.
The other cat does the same.
Both cats are meowing.

These two cats rest happily.
With blinking eyes they look at each other.
Softly, they wag their tails like a feather.
Then they stop meowing.


Two cats rest on their cat tower, 

One is on lower level while the other on top.

Light rains continuously and steadily fall.

They watch nature through the veils of afternoon rains.

After watching for a while, they begin licking their hair.

Each cat is busy with its own affairs

Gradually, they close their eyes and fall asleep

These cats enjoy napping while afternoon rains continue falling.

Two Persian Cats on window sill, 

Never bored nor get their fill

Back to back for hours long; 

Their spines must be strong. 


Mesmerized.  by every moment, 

Captured by any movement -

of the dead fly by the sill-

like bookends.  

on a shelve, 

back to back do they dwell-

as if suddenly ossified

or victims of Taxidermy, 

but both are quite alive, 

how curious they be! 


What could they possibly see? 

Ah! Fatuous me. 

How blatantly obvious 

what our oculars don't see 

that the two Persians see.


We're too thankless to see, 

What these cats easily-

Can savor and embrace 

in their protected space; 

The magnificence of Life. 



And, if Cats, OH, could speak, 

How embarrassed we'd be

If we could hear what they thought-

about you, about me! 





RAfter finishing a poem

I sit in the sun room, watching the sky.

It's about  m

Without winds, the air is calm.

Trees and branches are deep in their sleeps.

The neighbor's dead tree is waiting for birds to come.

Hoarse caws of flying crows travel from a neighbor hill.

The sky is overcast with patches of clouds.

Inside this quiet room, one cat rests and wags her tail.

This cat already had her breakfast.

Imitating human, she watches morning sky and clouds.

Then the other cat arrives.


They both lie down to watch the sky.
Two children (small), one Four, one Five,
Once saw a bee go in a hive,
They'd never seen a bee before!
So waited there to see some more.
And sure enough along they came
A dozen bees (and all the same!)
Within the hive they buzzed about;
Then, one by one, they all flew out.
Said Four: 'Those bees are silly things,
But how I wish I had their wings!


'Morning shows the day
Leader shows the way, 
Good leaders show good ways
Bad leaders show bad, 
So leadership is a fact
To be and select leader always
To be complete serious
Otherwise, you will lose
Yourselves with nations and alls
And the recovery hardly returns. 


Skin remembers how long the years grow
when skin is not touched, a gray tunnel
of singleness, feather lost from the tail
of a bird, swirling onto a step,
swept away by someone who never saw
it was a feather. Skin ate, walked,
slept by itself, knew how to raise a 
see-you-later hand. But skin felt
it was never seen, never known as
a land on the map, nose like a city,
hip like a city, gleaming dome of the mosque
and the hundred corridors of cinnamon and rope.


Skin had hope, that's what skin does.
Heals over the scarred place, makes a road.
Love means you breathe in two countries.
And skin remembers--silk, spiny grass,
deep in the pocket that is skin's secret own.
Even now, when skin is not alone,
it remembers being alone and thanks something larger
that there are travelers, that people go places
larger than themselves. 


They are floating on the beach
such as dead anemones, 
the two Syrian children
returned to the silence.
They made a road
tied to the waves
together with their blinded parents
in an imposible exodus
toward the protective cloak of christians 
from the other side of the sea.

Only children die in wars.
Men and women remain
in victory or defeat
according to where they have
bet their blood.


Only children trust in gods, 
they cling to their powerful hands
and wait for an indifferent salvation.

Only children sing to life
because yet beauty and sadness
don't nail their hearts.

The dead children from Syria
walk on the waters
and they will arrive at destinacion.
I see them in the horizon. 


both are like the falling leaves
a tale that no one ever believes
a passing season and a lover

coming and going of perfume
revolves in an enchanted room
till love consumes a fevered heart

death is the breast of darkest night
a western moon fades from sight
surrendered to its mausoleum

yet we cling to seasons past
affections that can never last
antique lies we choose to cherish

like gardens where maidens stray 
and angel spirits croon and sway
and wait to satisfy our hunger


Two lonely destinies have met at sunset, 
Smiled timidly at each other, 
Trying the pain of loneliness to smother.

They were still so naïve to believe: 
Their meeting was not an accidental.
May be one of them was just mental!  

Two lonely souls didn't want the doles.
Eye to eye gazed sadly.
They needed love madly.

 
The world around was silent but brilliant.
Only beating hearts you could hear at night, 
And see the shining stars light.

Everything in this world is relative and formative, 
Only the flames of fluttering candles resemble
The trust and a real temple.

They touched hands tenderly.
Their fate has passed happily.

What has happened was just a ghostlike, 
But the ghostly fence has collapsed.
The time of loneliness has elapsed.

Two lonely destinies have met not to regret.
They would never like to part.
They forever love their start. 


Had she misunderstood those warm invites
To travel and taste a different world? 
Her sheltered close life denied her. She might
'Tho allow fancy to fly. Control learned, 
She could only re-read the lovely lines
Of tenderest words, and bury them deep
In her innermost soul. Unbidden, her mind
Now uncovers new dreams, secrets she'll keep.
In different places within her warmed heart.
Knowing, once found, soul-mates are never apart. 

If you called me 'two-dimensional', I guess
I'd go away and think about it - is he
insulting me and if so, how? 

Though in a sense, all of us here in cyberspace
are two dimensional, to each other? 

There's one time, though, when two dimensions
would be a blessing: like today, 
when the cutely photographed brochure
for IKEA, the flat-pack furniture giant, 
thudded through the letterbox 
with its cosy nordic world as fresh and clean and scented
as a newly-built sauna just fired up; 

then the two-dimensional me
could simply slip like a well-trained bookmark
between page - 'a welcoming family room'
and page - 'a bathroom to relax in'
with a pine-scented sigh of relief
that I wouldn't have to drive ten miles, 
queue out of sight of the parking-lot just to get in, 
then after checking what was out of stock, 
go home and try to put the bloody thing together
despite the missing bolt.


You'll find me there on page  
under the artfully arranged bubbles, relaxing
in my carefree, blond and nordic way, 
smiling the smug smile
of the sterile two-dimensional. 


For years we've had a little dog,
Last year we acquired a big dog;
He wasn't big when we got him,
He was littler than the dog we had.
We thought our little dog would love him,
Would help him to become a trig dog,
But the new little dog got bigger,
And the old little dog got mad.

Now the big dog loves the little dog,
But the little dog hates the big dog,
The little dog is eleven years old,
And the big dog only one;
The little dog calls him 
Schweinhund,
The little dog calls him Pig-dog,
She grumbles broken curses
As she dreams in the August sun.

The big dog's teeth are terrible,
But he wouldn't bite the little dog;
The little dog wants to grind his bones,
But the little dog has no teeth;
The big dog is acrobatic,
The little dog is a brittle dog;
She leaps to grip his jugular,
And passes underneath.

The big dog clings to the little dog
Like glue and cement and mortar;
The little dog is his own true love;
But the big dog is to her
Like a scarlet rag to a Longhorn,
Or a suitcase to a porter;
The day he sat on the hornet
I distinctly heard her purr.


Well, how can you blame the little dog,
Who was once the household darling?
He romps like a young Adonis,
She droops like an old mustache;
No wonder she steals his corner,
No wonder she comes out snarling,
No wonder she calls him 
Cochon
And even 

Yet once I wanted a sandwich,
Either caviar or cucumber,
When the sun had not yet risen
And the moon had not yet sank;
As I tiptoed through the hallway
The big dog lay in slumber,
And the little dog slept by the big dog,
And her head was on his flank. 


I had as lief be embraced by the portier of the hotel
As to get no more from the moonlight
Than your moist hand.

Be the voice of the night and Florida in my ear.
Use dasky words and dusky images.
Darken your speech.

Speak, even, as if I did not hear you speaking,
But spoke for you perfectly in my thoughts,
Conceiving words,

As the night conceives the sea-sound in silence,
And out of the droning sibilants makes
A serenade.

Say, puerile, that the buzzards crouch on the ridge-pole
and sleep with one eye watching the stars fall
Beyond Key West.

Say that the palms are clear in the total blue.
Are clear and are obscure; that it is night;
That the moon shines. 

Sure, not a bother, Mc


Graths is it you said 

You’ll be after being at Mary Ellens funeral then.
A great crowd and the priest spoke well
Fine day for the living is angels by the grave for the dead.

No one left at the old place now the old girl’s gone.
You put me in mind of her only kid, 
Fell out, or so I heard, a long time back, 
A great pity that, but sure, isn’t it true, 
Life marches on.

But you’re not here to be listening to an auld man blatherin, 
Directions you were wanting, Mc


Graths you said.
Now if I were you young lady, and ‘tis easy see I’m not 
It’s not this road I’d be after takin.
But sure you’re here, that’s a tired sun, 
And its west your facing.
 
Go on down this road a ways, about a mile, 
Perhaps a little more, then at Careys Cross go left.
Be careful  mind, do not take the bog boreen, 
‘Tis hardly used at all these days. Modern times.
What with new-fangled central heating and the like
It's not turf now ye young ones are wanting to be cuttin’.

Where was I now, oh yes, Mc


Graths.
You’ll not be going very long when soon as spit you’re
At spinney fork, keep right of old Stump Murphys well.
Follow on that road a spell, down past Vinnie Healys pit
And in the littlest while you’ll pass the co-op creamery yard.
Closed now, but sure, more progress I suppose.

Beyond this and where the road turns from road to path
Twists round and back upon itself
Mc


Graths. 

I have something to tell you.
I'm listening.
I'm dying.
I'm sorry to hear.
I'm growing old.
It's terrible.
It is. I thought you should know
of course and I'm sorry. Keep in touch.
I will and you too.
And let know what's new.
Certainly, though it can't be much.
And stay well.
And you too.
And go slow.
And you too. 


Once upon the time there were two frogs
At my Annville Paradise Koi ponds
One frog was big and the other small
One croaked and the other too young to make a call.
They came there as spring guests
And they became my pond pets.
I could watch them but I couldn’t pet.
They basked on pond edging rocks
They hid themselves near waterlily pads
I watched them often so they let me come close
They didn’t jump when they hear my foot steps
They both grew in size and courage
I enjoyed the croaks when I walked around
Or when I rested on my gazebo hammock.
Today I lie on my Gazebo hammock for my noon rest
I hear no croaks of my pond frog.
I enjoy ever changing melodies of Corinthian wind chimes
But I miss croaking rhymes of my frog.
At the first Paradise
The serpent tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit
But at my Annville Paradise
A black serpent devoured my frogs the previous night.
After checking around my Koi ponds and lily pads
I recognize that no longer I have my pets
A sudden melancholy sinks in my heart.



And have we done with War at last? 
Well, we’ve been lucky devils both, 
And there’s no need of pledge or oath 
To bind our lovely friendship fast, 
By firmer stuff
Close bound enough. 

By wire and wood and stake we’re bound, 
By Fricourt and by Festubert, 
By whipping rain, by the sun’s glare, 
By all the misery and loud sound,
By a Spring day, 
By Picard clay. 

Show me the two so closely bound 
As we, by the red bond of blood, 
By friendship, blossoming from mud,
By Death: we faced him, and we found 
Beauty in Death, 
In dead men breath. 


Pushing a stroller as she walked in a hurry
She was dressed in clothes that were dirty
With hair matted and a face of lines that deeply ran
The stroller looked as if it came from a garbage can

Hanging from the handles were dirty leather bags
Covering something in the seat tattered blankets like rags
She approached looking like time had been unkind
But in her eyes a glimmering smile was defined

I opened my mouth to speak to her
And see if I could make a help offer
Slowly she lifted her hand and stretched a curved finger
"Shhhhhh, ' she said while over her mouth it did linger

Then down she reached for the tattered blanket
I knew that spot was special and private
She picked up a change purse from the seat
Opened it wide as she tried to be discreet

She motioned for me to look inside
It was full of gold dollars to my surprise
She reached in and took out two of them
Then grabbed my hand and I knew it was Him

All of a sudden a fear came over me
A soft voice in the breeze began to speak
'Don't be afraid, you know I Am'
Then she put the two dollars in my hand

When I looked up to thank her
Something happened I’ll always remember
She and her stroller were gone as if she had never been there
At the gold dollars I looked and just stared


Dogwood

dogwood blooms in spring
hope is yet a white desire
green leaves hold their gold



Buttermilk Sky

flaky clouds floating
the sun is a daffodil
darkness calls me hometwo hearts and a song

morning so beautified

mourning 

hum the harmony for humanity

like this truly like this
writing in the wind, calling the wind

a man like you are for men
 
you said two hearts a song
and created and composed 
many a songs-many a hearts

it’s purely for all that hearts
that can beat for you

peace through love 
and 
love through peace

if love is two hearts and a song

I may be torn
I may be lovelorn

Amidst we
I. 
Global festival of human songs

Try singing these and smile
Hum even if the songs has broken rhythm

The Ragas of life

Why carry a broken heart
I may be playing the broken flute

It’s not only the two hearts and a song

But for many a hearts that hums 

I believe
I shall sing on these lovesongs for lovely people.

Songs not yet shaken
For love knows it’s own unlimitedness 
open-endedness


Heavenly virtues
Loving all and hating none
Here, there, each hidden, open 
And all lives in all sphere. 

I watched two hoes fight in the hall
one fell down and the other got mauled. 

The eyes of two in love meet
constant to picture how sweet
their hearts fit as one complete; 
their joys for each other neat
like the cherries in crisp heat. 


sleep evades me
like the rain
evades the desert

silence creeps
through the night
wide open eyes

my breathing and
the voices in my head
is all i can hear

they are calling 
gesticulating, cant help
but follow them where they lead

they scale up 
into my neurons 
squelch any sign of dissent

they knock knock
 knock on the sentient
and question their volition

they ask not 
of dreams, of triumphs, 
ask not of love and resent

they think in vain
tell stories of bane
diabolic and uncompassionate

they elicit tears
inexcusably educe fears
make the night eternal

benighted, cannot battle
these thoughts that 
seize my complete being

angry Morpheus
aren't you charmed with
my gentle smile and gracious eyes

all i do is 
lie in wait for
the morning light to seep through


they deliver me
from the dark shadows
bringing with them sweet slumber

finally i sleep
with salty wet cheeks
when the dawn and moon speaks. 


Two little boys swore to holy friendship, 
    There was no bond to tie them or kinship.
    Days went by fast, and they remained true, 
    They took different paths in life, high and low.
    They seldom saw each other on purpose or met.
    Though they had a great deal of love and respect.
    Year after year after year they had not met, 
    There was also a war that struck so hard.
    One was out. One was there on his guard.
    But deep inside, they have some hopes, 
    For they believe they know the ropes:



    Love and forgetting might have carried them 
A little further up the mountain side 
With night so near, but not much further up.


They must have halted soon in any case 
With thoughts of a path back, how rough it was 
With rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness; 
When they were halted by a tumbled wall 
With barbed-wire binding. They stood facing this, 
Spending what onward impulse they still had 
In One last look the way they must not go, 
On up the failing path, where, if a stone 
Or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself; 
No footstep moved it. 'This is all,' they sighed, 
Good-night to woods.' But not so; there was more. 
A doe from round a spruce stood looking at them 
Across the wall, as near the wall as they. 
She saw them in their field, they her in hers. 
The difficulty of seeing what stood still, 
Like some up-ended boulder split in two, 
Was in her clouded eyes; they saw no fear there. 
She seemed to think that two thus they were safe. 
Then, as if they were something that, though strange, 
She could not trouble her mind with too long, 
She sighed and passed unscared along the wall. 
'This, then, is all. What more is there to ask?' 
But no, not yet. A snort to bid them wait. 
A buck from round the spruce stood looking at them 
Across the wall as near the wall as they. 
This was an antlered buck of lusty nostril, 
Not the same doe come back into her place. 
He viewed them quizzically with jerks of head, 
As if to ask, 'Why don't you make some motion? 
Or give some sign of life? Because you can't. 
I doubt if you're as living as you look
 

Thus till he had them almost feeling dared 
To stretch a proffering hand -- and a spell-breaking. 
Then he too passed unscared along the wall. 
Two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from. 
'This must be all.' It was all. Still they stood, 
A great wave from it going over them, 
As if the earth in one unlooked-for favour 
Had made them certain earth returned their love. 


Two lovers in the night
Silhouetted by love's flight
Do they know what they hold
As they hold each other tight

Emotions reeling, the feelings
Do they know what they hold
Now the touch they need so much
As they hold each other close

The starry skies, the fire flies
As they love away the night
Will they remember their love
As the night it passes by

In the morning of the dawning
Before the break of sun
Will they remember the souls
The two became as one

In the light of love's flight
Silhouetted by the night
Do they know what they hold
As they hold each other tight.



The moonlight rides the waves 
of an incoming tide 
We stand alone on the beach 
locked within one another's embrace 
Two lovers at the portal of Love's eternity 

Just as the waves 
stroke the shore in flawless rhythm 
Two hearts rise in one matchless crest 
There is refuge in one another's embrace 
Two lovers that stand alone on the beach 

Eyes locked, breathless rhythm of hearts 
Dancing in the wind, splash of waves coming in 
A promise to love and behold till eternity, 
A perfect strength to carry on forever


Two men stood fishing only yards apart on a sandy windswept beach
 Neither established eye contact, and neither preferred to speak
 But each looked deep at the other when the other was turned away
 And each saw some of himself as he gazed at the other that day
 The older man saw himself as he thought he was many years before
 Strong and self-confident, unafraid and secure
 The younger man saw a glimpse of the future, a man true of his ideals
 A man with some faults, but a man worth knowing because of his knowledge of wheels
 Each man thought of the other as one of only one
 For you see on that windy sandy beach stood a father and his son
 And the older man's fears will eventually come true, as life's like a stream flowing past
 But with luck, some day, another two men will stand there with rods to cast
 The one thing left unsaid by the paltry few lines of this rhyme
 Is the love each man has for the other, a love never changing with time


I keep dreaming of my graduation exam:
in a window sit two chained monkeys,
beyond the window floats the sky,
and the sea splashes.

I am taking an exam on the history of mankind:
I stammer and flounder.

One monkey, eyes fixed upon me, listens ironically,
the other seems to be dozing- 
and when silence follows a question,
he prompts me
with a soft jingling of the chain. 


Two or three Posies 
With two or three simples--
Two or three Noses
With two or three pimples--
Two or three wise men
And two or three ninny's--
Two or three guineas--
Two or three raps
At two or three doors--
Two or three naps
Of two or three hours--
Two or three Cats
And two or three mice--
Two or three sprats
At a very great price--
Two or three sandies
And two or three tabbies--
Two or three dandies
And two Mrs.------
Two or three Smiles
And two or three frowns--
Two or three Miles
To two or three towns--
Two or three pegs
For two or three bonnets--
Two or three dove eggs
To hatch into sonnets. 

Two or three angels 
Came near to the earth. 
They saw a fat church. 
Little black streams of people 
Came and went in continually. 
And the angels were puzzled 
To know why the people went thus, 
And why they stayed so long within. 


Under the after-sunset sky
Two pewits sport and cry,
More white than is the moon on high
Riding the dark surge silently;
More black than earth. Their cry
Is the one sound under the sky.
They alone move, now low, now high,
And merrily they cry
To the mischievous Spring sky,
Plunging earthward, tossing high,
Over the ghost who wonders why
So merrily they cry and fly,
Nor choose 'twixt earth and sky,
While the moon's quarter silently
Rides, and earth rests as silently. 


Oh, not the loss of the accomplished thing! 
Not dumb farewells, nor long relinquishment 
Of beauty had, and golden summer spent, 
And savage glory of the fluttering 
Torn banners of the rain, and frosty ring 
Of moon-white winters, and the imminent 
Long-lunging seas, and glowing students bent 
To race on some smooth beach the gull's wing:

Not these, nor all we've been, nor all we've loved, 
The pitiful familiar names, had moved 
Our hearts to weep for them; but oh, the star 
The future is! Eternity's too wan 
To give again that undefeated, far, 
All-possible irradiance of dawn.



Like moon-dark, like brown water you escape, 
O laughing mouth, O sweet uplifted lips. 
Within the peering brain old ghosts take shape; 
You flame and wither as the white foam slips 
Back from the broken wave: sometimes a start, 
A gesture of the hands, a way you own 
Of bending that smooth head above your heart,-- 
Then these are varied, then the dream is gone.

Oh, you are too much mine and flesh of me 
To seal upon the brain, who in the blood 
Are so intense a pulse, so swift a flood 
Of beauty, such unceasing instancy. 
Dear unimagined brow, unvisioned face, 
 
From fated gashes gurgle streams
Snatch carmine rags from the seams
Where gold peaks, from proud hills
Peppers life in dales, humming mills

A son lies sans cap and open mouth
Softly on grasses that creep from south
Sleeps, stretched, under the blue sky
pale in his green bed where rain drops fly
 
Gladioli tickle his feet, he sleeps, smiles.
Like a stricken child without the guiles.
Cradle softly nature, for he is cold
Ah! In life, was so warm and bold

No earthly incense shall quiver the nare
Nor mortal cares transgress his lair
He sleeps in the sun, hand on his breast
Calm! Red roses ooze from the side of his chest

 



He comes out of his hiding place, 
With a husky voice and a pale face.
His words expose his phoney force, 
He puts the cart before the horse. 
He kills and wrecks with the right hand, 
And digs his grave with the other hand. 

I have come to a fork in the road
each path is a mystery
on the right is a green woodland
a reminder of my childhood home
the hills are alive with adventure
everything is moving in this place

on my left is barren wasteland
the road stretches off to the sea
where the seagulls cry their tears
the wind rattles the palm fronds
and the sun sinks into the horizon
in a lifeless scarlet blaze of sunset


A humble wild-rose, pink and slender, 
 Was plucked and placed in a bright bouquet, 
Beside a Jacqueminot’s royal splendour, 
 And both in my lady’s boudoir lay.

Said the haughty bud, in a tone of scorning, 
 ‘I wonder why you are called a rose? 
Your leaves will fade in a single morning; 
 No blood of mine in your pale cheek glows.

‘Your course green stalk shows dust of the highway, 
 You have no depths of fragrant bloom; 
And what could you learn in a rustic byway
 To fit you to lie in my lady’s room? 

‘If called to adorn her warm, white bosom, 
 What have you to offer for such a place, 
Beside my fragrant and splendid blossom, 
 Ripe with colour and rich with grace? 

Said the sweet wild-rose, ‘Despite your dower
 Of finer breeding and deeper hue, 
Despite your beauty, fair, high-bred flower, 
 It is I who should lie on her breast, not you.

‘For small account is your hot-house glory
 Beside the knowledge that came to me
When I heard by the wayside love’s old story
 And felt the kiss of the amorous bee.’



 I put my heart to school
In the world, where men grow wise,
"Go out," I said, "and learn the rule;
Come back when you win a prize


My heart came back again:
"Now where is the prize?" I cried. ----
"The rule was false, and the prize was pain,
And the teacher's name was Pride


I put my heart to school
In the woods, where veeries sing,
And brooks run cool and clear;
In the fields, where wild flowers spring,
And the blue of heaven bends near.
"Go out," I said: "you are half a fool,
But perhaps they can teach you here


"And why do you stay so long,
My heart, and where do you roam?"
The answer came with a laugh and a song, ---
I find this school is home


I 

The stars were wild that summer evening 
As on the low lake shore stood you and I 
And every time I caught your flashing eye 
Or heard your voice discourse on anything 
It seemed a star went burning down the sky. 

I looked into your heart that dying summer 
And found your silent woman's heart grown wild 
Whereupon you turned to me and smiled 
Saying you felt afraid but that you were 
Weary of being mute and undefiled 

II 

I spoke to you that last winter morning 
Watching the wind smoke snow across the ice 
Told of how the beauty of your spirit, flesh, 
And smile had made day break at night and spring 
Burst beauty in the wasting winter's place. 

You did not answer when I spoke, but stood 
As if that wistful part of you, your sorrow, 
Were blown about in fitful winds below; 
Your eyes replied your worn heart wished it could 
Again be white and silent as the snow. 

We live in two separate world
one world is yours, 
another is mine.


Mine is a dreamer
thinking about the activity of your world
sometimes feel happy, sometimes feel sad, 
sometimes go jealous, sometimes go mad.

Your world is an epitome of wisdom
being practical and realistic are its virtues
still i feel few dreams you hold
that you write on the sky
of your beautiful mind.
since my world is attracted towards yours, 
so your world responds
for it is too kind.


My world and Your world
a parallel path indeed, 
so what if these two don't meet, 
my world will keep the pace
with your world aside, 
even if the distance increases by infinity
the consciousness of my world
will cover the gap between both of us.


The lonely saga
of this journey
upheaved in troubled
waters and seldom
silent in deep sea
very many hurricanes
crossed without 
stopping the sail.

The other voyage
full of aspirants
to partner the 
the war song
dreaming up to
touch the ferry
without fail.

Racing each other
the warriors
fiercely battled
neglecting the
ravages of time
brushing aside
until the loner
wrecked in hail. 


There are two sides to every coin
One heads and ones called tails! 
One side has a beautiful face or scene imprinted
And the other of which seems to pale. 

But don't forget that it has also an outer edge
Not really smooth with its etched ridges rough. 
Just like life's journey, wouldn't you say? 
With life's troubles presented stuff! 

Now flip your coin and see where it lands! 
You may get a BIG surprise! 
For the flip might show you a different picture
Than what is on your coins other side

There was a man, it was said one time, 
Who went astray in his youthful prime.
Can the brain keep cool and the heart keep quiet
When the blood is a river that’s running riot? 
And boys will be boys the old folks say, 
And the man is better who’s had his day.

The sinner reformed; and the preacher told
Of the prodigal son who came back to the fold.
With a warmer welcome than ever before.
Wealth and honour were his to command, 
And a spotless woman gave him her hand.

And the world strewed their pathway with blossoms aboom


There was a maiden who went astray
In the golden dawn of her life’s young day.
She had more passion and heart than head, 
And she followed blindly where fond Love led, 
And Love unchecked is a dangerous guide
To wander at will by a fair girl’s side.


The woman repented and turned from sin, 
But no door opened to let her in.
The preacher prayed that she might be forgiven, 
But told her to look for mercy – in Heaven.

For this is the law of the earth, we know: 
That the woman is stoned, while the man may go.

A brave man weddded her after all, 
But the world said, frowning, ‘We shall not call.’


I 

"Why are your songs all wild and bitter sad 
As funeral dirges with the orphans' cries? 
Each night since first the world was made hath had 
A sequent day to laugh it down the skies. 
Chant us a glee to make our hearts rejoice, 
Or seal in silence this unmanly moan

 

My friend, I have no power to rule my voice -- 
A spirit lifts me where I lie alone, 
And thrills me into song by its own laws; 
That which I feel, but seldom know, indeed 
Tempering the melody it could not cause. 
The bleeding heart cannot forever bleed 
Inwardly solely; on the wan lips, too, 
Dark blood will bubble ghastly into view. 


II 

Striving to sing glad songs, I but attain 
Wild discords sadder than Grief's saddest tune; 
As if an owl with his harsh screech should strain 
To over-gratulate a thrush of June. 
The nightingale upon its thorny spray 
Finds inspiration in the sullen dark; 
The kindling dawn, the world-wide joyous day 
Are inspiration to the soaring lark; 
The seas are silent in the sunny calm, 
Their anthem surges in the tempest boom; 
The skies outroll no solemn thunder psalm 
Till they have clothed themselves with clouds of gloom. 
My mirth can laugh and talk, but cannot sing; 
My grief finds harmonies in everything.


I

As men have loved their lovers in times past
And sung their wit, their virtue and their grace,
So have we loved sweet Justice to the last,
That now lies here in an unseemly place.
The child will quit the cradle and grow wise
And stare on beauty till his senses drown;
Yet shall be seen no more by mortal eyes
Such beauty as here walked and here went down.
Like birds that hear the winter crying plain
Her courtiers leave to seek the clement south;
Many have praised her, we alone remain
To break a fist against the lying mouth
Of any man who says this was not so:
Though she be dead now, as indeed we know.

II

Where can the heart be hidden in the ground
And be at peace, and be at peace forever,
Under the world, untroubled by the sound
Of mortal tears, that cease from pouring never?
Well for the heart, by stern compassion harried,
If death be deeper than the churchmen say, --
Gone from this world indeed what's graveward carried,
And laid to rest indeed what's laid away.
Anguish enough while yet the indignant breather
Have blood to spurt upon the oppressor's hand;
Who would eternal be, and hang in ether
A stuffless ghost above his struggling land,
Retching in vain to render up the groan
That is not there, being aching dust's alone


I.
Fame, like a wayward girl, will still be coy
To those who woo her with too slavish knees,
But makes surrender to some thoughtless boy,
And dotes the more upon a heart at ease;
She is a Gypsy,-will not speak to those
Who have not learnt to be content without her;
A Jilt, whose ear was never whisper'd close,
Who thinks they scandal her who talk about her;
A very Gypsy is she, Nilus-born,
Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar;
Ye love-sick Bards! repay her scorn for scorn;
Ye Artists lovelorn! madmen that ye are!
Make your best bow to her and bid adieu,
Then, if she likes it, she will follow you.

II.
'You cannot eat your cake and have it too.'~Proverb.

How fever'd is the man, who cannot look
Upon his mortal days with temperate blood,
Who vexes all the leaves of his life's book,
And robs his fair name of its maidenhood;
It is as if the rose should pluck herself,
On the ripe plum finger its misty bloom,
As if a Naiad, like a meddling elf,
Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom:
But the rose leaves herself upon the briar,
For winds to kiss and grateful bees to feed,
And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire,
The undisturbed lake has crystal space;
Why then should man, teasing the world for grace,
Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed


I. 
Haydon! forgive me that I cannot speak 
Definitively of these mighty things; 
Forgive me, that I have not eagle's wings, 
That what I want I know not where to seek, 
And think that I would not be over-meek, 
In rolling out upfollowed thunderings, 
Even to the steep of Heliconian springs, 
Were I of ample strength for such a freak. 
Think, too, that all these numbers should be thine; 
Whose else? In this who touch thy vesture's hem? 
For, when men stared at what was most divine 
With brainless idiotism and o'erwise phlegm, 
Thou hadst beheld the full Hesperian shine 
Of their star in the east, and gone to worship them.

II. On Seeing The Elgin Marbles.

My spirit is too weak - mortality
Weighs heavily upon me like unwilling sleep,
And each imagined pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep
That I have not the cloudy winds to keep,
Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye.
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
Bring round the heart an undescribable feud;
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
Wasting of old Time -- with a billowy main -- 
A sun -- a shadow of a magnitude. 


A torch is taken and another sent
To the wretched ones a hope is lent

From florence sent to kotkata slums
help them feed on smiles an crumbs

Sang her song on the Crimean fields
The other in slums lepers healed


In the fair morning of his life, 
When his pure heart lay in his breast, 
Panting, with all that wild unrest 
To plunge into the great world's strife

That fills young hearts with mad desire, 
He saw a sunset. Red and gold 
The burning billows surged and rolled, 
And upward tossed their caps of fire.


He looked. And as he looked the sight 
Sent from his soul through breast and brain 
Such intense joy, it hurt like pain. 
His heart seemed bursting with delight.

So near the Unknown seemed, so close 
He might have grasped it with his hand. 
He felt his inmost soul expand, 
As sunlight will expand a rose.

One day he heard a singing strain-- 
A human voice, in bird-like trills. 
He paused, and little rapture-rills 
Went trickling downward through each vein.


And in his heart the whole day long, 
As in a temple veiled and dim, 
He kept and bore about with him 
The beauty of that singer's song.

And then? But why relate what then? 
His smoldering heart flamed into fire-- 
He had his one supreme desire, 
And plunged into the world of men.

With pleasures of the grosser kind 
She fed his flesh and drugged his mind, 
Till, shamed, he sated turned away.

He sought his boyhood's home. That hour 
Triumphant should have been, in sooth, 
Since he went forth an unknown youth, 
And came back crowned with wealth and power.


The clouds made day a gorgeous bed; 
He saw the splendor of the sky 
With unmoved heart and stolid eye; 
He knew only West was red.

Then suddenly a fresh young voice 
Rose, bird-like, from some hidden place, 
He did not even turn his face; 
It struck him simply as a noise.

He trod the old paths up and down. 
Their ruch-hued leaves by Fall winds whirled-- 
How dull they were--how dull the world-- 
Dull even in the pulsing town.


O! worst of punishments, that brings 
A blunting of all finer sense, 
A loss of feelings keen, intense, 
And dulls us to the higher things.

O! penalty most dire, most sure, 
Swift following after gross delights, 
That we no more see beauteous sights, 
Or hear as hear the good and pure.

O! shape more hideous and more dread 
Than Vengeance takes in creed-taught minds, 
This certain doom that blunts and blinds, 
And strikes the holiest feelings dead.


Two swimmers wrestled on the spar—
Until the morning sun—
When One—
turned smiling to the land—

The stray ships—passing—
Spied a face—
Upon the waters borne—
With eyes in death—
still begging raised—
And hands—beseeching—
thrown


Out of the mud two strangers came
And caught me splitting wood in the yard,
And one of them put me off my aim
By hailing cheerily "Hit them hard!"
I knew pretty well why he had dropped behind
And let the other go on a way.
I knew pretty well what he had in mind:
He wanted to take my job for pay.

Good blocks of oak it was I split,
As large around as the chopping block;
And every piece I squarely hit
Fell splinterless as a cloven rock.
The blows that a life of self-control
Spares to strike for the common good,
That day, giving a loose my soul,
I spent on the unimportant wood.

The sun was warm but the wind was chill.
You know how it is with an April day
When the sun is out and the wind is still,
You're one month on in the middle of May.
But if you so much as dare to speak,
A cloud comes over the sunlit arch,
A wind comes off a frozen peak,
And you're two months back in the middle of March.


A bluebird comes tenderly up to alight
And turns to the wind to unruffle a plume,
His song so pitched as not to excite
A single flower as yet to bloom.
It is snowing a flake; and he half knew
Winter was only playing possum.
Except in color he isn't blue,
But he wouldn't advise a thing to blossom.

The water for which we may have to look
In summertime with a witching wand,
In every wheelrut's now a brook,
In every print of a hoof a pond.
Be glad of water, but don't forget
The lurking frost in the earth beneath
That will steal forth after the sun is set
And show on the water its crystal teeth.

The time when most I loved my task
The two must make me love it more
By coming with what they came to ask.
You'd think I never had felt before
The weight of an ax-head poised aloft,
The grip of earth on outspread feet,
The life of muscles rocking soft
And smooth and moist in vernal heat.


Out of the wood two hulking tramps
But not long since in the lumber camps).
They thought all chopping was theirs of right.
Men of the woods and lumberjacks,
They judged me by their appropriate tool.
Except as a fellow handled an ax
They had no way of knowing a fool.

Nothing on either side was said.
They knew they had but to stay their stay

And all their logic would fill my head:
As that I had no right to play
With what was another man's work for gain.
My right might be love but theirs was need.
And where the two exist in twain
Theirs was the better right--agreed.

But yield who will to their separation,
My object in living is to unite
My avocation and my vocation
As my two eyes make one in sight.
Only where love and need are one,
And the work is play for mortal stakes,
Is the deed ever really done
For Heaven and the future's sakes.




Two Travellers perishing in Snow
The Forests as they froze
Together heard them strengthening
Each other with the words

That Heaven if Heaven—must contain
What Either left behind
And then the cheer too solemn grew
For language, and the wind

Long steps across the features took
That Love had touched the Morn
With reverential Hyacinth—
The taleless Days went on

Till Mystery impatient drew
And those They left behind
Led absent, were procured of Heaven
As Those first furnished, said—

Two troubles in life; 
One, not getting what we want, 
The other, getting what we want; 
Both are equally unsettling. 


Julia Doyle arrived at Spinoza HS 
with visions of creating a real Community
and to that end she announced
all submissions from the faculty
would be published in the school’s
literary magazine.
One day in the Teacher’s Center
Minna Cohen asked Julia, 
"When’s the magazine coming out? "
"Soon.  

but I didn’t understand a word."
I immediately said, "Julia, you promised us
we’d get published."
"I thought Minna would do a love story."
"Not much love the last decade, " she said 
"Imagination, Minna. You’ve got that-
at least I hope so-
no writer can function without it."
Minna muttered, "You said I’d make it
no matter what, just no dirty words
that’s what you said.
I need this-
just stick it in-
anyplace."
Julia stared at Minna saying, "You’re in."
"But Auschwitz? for a student magazine? 
and so confusing, the entire story
a six page monologue of mixed up words."
"I can see that because the narrative’s
part of a larger work I’ve been writing 
for the last eleven years
about the life of Hannah Greenberg, 
a doctor and survivor of Auschwitz
who went mad thirty years 
after her incarceration. The Death Camp 
deposited a time bomb in her soul."
"But, Minna, you only gave the insanity."
"How about my story? " I asked blurted out.
"A fat man’s saga into stroke."
"Yes."
"I expected humor, after all
you’re a funny guy."
"Not all fat men are funny, " I said, 
more bitterly than I intended.
"Yes, I’m sorry, but the entire tale
is uniformly dismal, yet I felt no sadness-
sorry, Bernstein, but-
why didn’t he just stop eating? "
"Insanity, " said Minna, her voice 
so soft, so calm, but with such certainty, 
"still here
now
the whole world."


A Milkweed

Anonymous as cherubs 
White seeds are floating 
Out of my burst pod. 
What power had I 
Before I learned to yield? 
Shatter me, great wind: 
I shall possess the field.


A Stone

As casual as cow-dung 
I lie where chance would have me, 
Up to the ears in sod. 
Why should I move? To move 
Befits a light desire. 
The sill of Heaven would founder, 
Did such as I aspire. 


I know two women, and one is chaste
And cold as the snows on a winters waste, 
Stainless ever I act and thought
(As a man, born dumb, in speech errs not) .
But she has malice toward her kind, 
A cruel tongue and a jealous mind.
Void of pity and full of greed, 
She judges the world by her narrow creed; 
A brewer of quarrels, a breeder of hate, 
Yet she holds the key to ‘Society’s’ Gate.

The other woman, with heart of flame, 
Went mad for a love that marred her name: 
And out of the grave of her murdered faith
She rose like a soul that has passed through death.
Her aims are noble, her pity so broad, 
A soother of discord, a healer of woes, 
Peace follows her footsteps wherever she goes.
The worthier life of the two, no doubt, 
And yet ‘Society’ locks her out. 




My   cell  phone   is  ringing
special ring-tone,   to  alert  calls from  her - 
it  is   my   maid  servant:   in feeble  voice
announcing   her   unscheduled  absence.

our  area  is   under    power  cut  today
from   am   to  pm
on  routine  shut  down;   added to it
no   water  in  our   flats'  pipeline.

Vexed   by   these  adverse  occurrence, 
I  booked  tickets  in  Express  Cinema
with   lunch  to be  managed   outside.
costly   alternatives,   sometimes  it  so  happens

inside the Mall,    Baskin  Robbins  ice cream  
Is   Rs.a   small  cup -
Medium  bowl   popcorn   Rs.one  hand-full.  -  threatening  price  lists.

Who is  she?  my  maid servant! same  cinema, 
under the dim light -  by  the  third  row,  in front, 
with  ice cream and   two  big  bowls, 
tucked  in her arms   for    her   only   son! 

seated   behind  in  a  dark  corner
I  opened up  the  same  saturated 
‘Diwali   bakshan'  to  be   shared
among    my  two  daughters

as usual,  the servant  turned-up  next  day
in grim face,   Zandu Balm  smelling  all over, 
'mam,  I  was  down  with  fever, all joints  paining
spare  me  Rs.  to  meet  the  doctor  evening'

I  am  a  PG  teacher,   badly  dependent on her service
her  bold lies and  false pretexts,   I  have  to  simply  swallow
In  tune  with  her  acting,  I extended  some  pill  &  gel  to apply
How clever this poor girl is, 
                                 harvesting Rs.for a batch of cold  lies.



The light of other days burns dim, 
And in the shade is cast, 
You'll own I'm right, if you will just 
Look back upon the past; 
It's glories all are faded, 
And each of you must know 
That times ain't what they used to be 
About two years ago. 

Bendigo, you know, my lads, 
Was just then in its prime, 
And those who happened to be here 
Had a most glorious time; 
But now its sadly altered, 
And things are precious slow, 
And times ain't what they used to be 
About two years ago. 

They opened Golden Gully then, 
And we had many a lob, 
To see the place so cut up now, 
It really makes me sob: 
When'eer I pass the fav'rite spot 
It fills me full of woe, 
Ah! times ain't what they used to was 
About two years ago. 

Just now look at the difference, 
Ah! here's the dreadful rub, 
They're washing for two pennyweights 
To every blessed tub; 
At such a paltry sum as that, 
Why, all of us you know 
Would have laughed and turned our noses up 
About two years ago. 

Two years ago, my lads, we used 
To take our nuggets down, 
Sell the lot, and go and have 
A spree in Melbourne town; 
We rode about in two-horse cabs, 
And made the champagne flow, 
And ate bank notes in sandwiches 
About two years ago. 

A sweetheart, then, on either arm 
About the town we'd range, 
And buy the dear things cashmere shawls, 
And refuse to take the change; 
Then to dancers at the theatre 
Our nuggest we did throw, 
Those were the glorious times, no flies, 
About two years ago. 

And when we'd quite run out of cash 
We'd tramp back every mile, 
And go to work again and get 
Another tidy pile; 
I ask you, can we do it now? 
But, echo answers no; 
Ah! times ai'nt what they used to was 
About two years ago. 

But after all, my lads, what use 
Is there in vain regret, 
No doubt some stunning golden piece 
Of ground may turn up yet, 
Then keep up all your peckers, 
And let your spirits flow, 
The good time yet may come again, 
Just like two years ago. 

The salt, a lot of people carry
In their eyes, desires to be water

We don't care, no time to
Rather we've learnt to celebrate some numbers
Of years, of dates, of killing

We've learnt to make come true
A lot of imaginary dreams of our ancestors

Tyranny is our pride
Despotism is our pleasure


Deprived of the ability to choose
we cease to operate as fully human
and can, no longer
reflect 

O Great Architect of Creative Humanism! 
Your works are so beyond the width of my words, 
So beyond the grasp of my mind; 
Still so fine that I should find
In every stone you’ve touched
The face of a smiling life, 
The life of a throbbing heart.
You have etched the heart of ‘Anand’
In the rocks of Warora – 
It is your monument to the world.
Anandwan is the art of your heart
And the heart of your art; 
Still I see it cannot be your masterpiece.
Your masterpiece is, indeed, 
That inexplicable and invisible work
In the minds of men you’ve wrought
The spirits that in sunken souls you’ve brought, 
The life of service that you sought, 
The fights for rights that you fought –
O Great Architect, if we all could get
At least a glimpse of the light that you’ve got! 
O embodiment of the meaning of life! 
O symbol of the success of struggle! 
You are the voice of our noisy times, 
The voice of our silent sufferers! 
Your voice shall not go drowned 
In the rising waters of the Narmada.
The strength of your voice 
Will break open our eyes; 
Your voice will make us wise; 
It will make us arise! 

The lines above were written 
When I was in Anandwan the first time
And you were with the Narmada.
Since I was then a newcomer
And since they knew me not then much
Some in Anandwan then thought 
That they were a trick of mine 
To win your favour, to allure you all.
But when I reached the Narmada
And you held my hands and told me 
How much you loved those lines
How much love and life you saw in them
How much you valued my coming there
A dynamic communication, a silent dialogue 
Had begun then between our hearts.
As testimony to that, not one but three poems, 
Issued forth from me instantaneously: 
Those lines I had scribbled 
By the banks of the river serene 
On a piece of paper I had in my pocket then 
When read out to you, 
You looked at me startled.
They were on what you had
Spoken to me just a while ago.
With moist eyes you held firm my hands
And said: "Much has already been written about me; 
But I think none has so far succeed in seeing me 
The way you now do! Best wishes to you."
Years later when I was with you again
Many a time, drawing me closer to your bed, 
Looking deep into my eyes, 
The same sentiments you would echo.
Once you said: "There is passion and compassion
And power in your voice; 
Keep writing – for justice, for truth; 
With confidence and courage, without any fear! "
And so, yes, I will keep writing –
But when it comes to writing on you
I must humbly admit: 
You are still
So much beyond the width of my words, 
So much beyond the grasp of my mind

Lying awake in my bed, 
I got an awful fright, 
Passing by the window, 
Went a colourful, bright light.

Didn't see where it did go.
I'm wondering if I've witnessed, 
An incoming U. 

F. 

O.

The window blinds are closed now, 
Back to my bed I've gone, 
Hoping I'm not visited, 
By some distant alien. 

Woke up one morning early
noticed it had been snowing all through the night.
But over in the side yard I'd spotted 
a huge circle of brown grass, not white! 

I ran and woke up my husband! 
to come and see what I just did! 
I told him it was made from a U. 

F. 

O
and that I was really possitive! 

My husband said, 'honey
you must of had to much wine to drink! '
Because that's where the lid of the septics' located
the snow melted from the septic's heat! 

Well I'm really not sure he's right you know
I'm still looking for a U. 

F. 

O. sighting one day! 
And maybe I'll let them take me to their planet
that will show that smarty husband! 
Then what will he have to say

I’m a liar and a thief with both hands and my tongue removed

Welcome to my world you Muslim mother f-kers

You and I have everything and yet nothing to lose

Because the facts are the virgins are all whores

Da te posadim
Na sred moje sobe
Pa da pustis korenje
Ispred moje police
Pune dobrih knjiga

Da srusim krov i zidove
Da imas vise sunca
Da ti citam dobre reci
Sve do prve kise
A onda da ih bacim

Prolaznici da me
Gledaju u cudu
I pitaju zasto sedim
Na kisi i sama
I zar nemam kucu

A ja da im kazem
Da nisam sama
I da si ti moja kuca
Da se malo zamisle
Na putu ka kucama
Punim suvih polica
U kojima ti
Ne znacis
Nista


Oci, samo oci vidis
Voda je topla i dobra kao mladost
Da skidam ovu masku kad mi pridjes tako


Me and daddy we loaded up the ford
On the back of a flat bed truck
We thought we would take her in for repairs
For what we thought it was worth
 
Just about the time we were coming into town
An old cow, she got loose
She ran right out in front of the truck
That's when it all went down
 
The cow had jumped the fence and got in our way
Daddy tried to save the truck
Daddy gave them brakes all he had
But it wasn't to be our luck
 
The chains gave way holding down that ford
It was not to our desire
It sounded like a cannon round going off
When the impact exploded the tires
 
Well them hubcaps blew right off of that ford
And they sailed up high in the sky
And they were coming down heading right for town
As me and daddy looked on in surprise
 
One it hit a highline wire
That just gave it some spring
And the people looking on thought UFO's
It was the darndest thing
 
One it hit the church bell tower
That old bell began to ring
Lights went down all over town
And people they began to scream
 
The sherriff comes out, he's gonna shoot one down
As people ran all around
Then one went through the windows of his truck
And still it didn't slow down
 
The sherriff says, We is being attacked! 
Call in the national guard! 
As me and daddy are laughing on our backs
This was really a card! 
 
The last one went through the mayors house
From where he was in the living room
It broke many dishes in his kitchen as well
As out the window it zoomed
 
Well the army it did come indeed
And they checked the whole town out
But all they could find of anything
Was them ford hubcaps about
 
The sherriff says, Naw, that ain't it! 
Despite the bullet holes in it as well
I know a UFO when I see's it! 
This is how the story tells
 
They put up a sign when you come into town
This is where UFO's are found
This put the little town right on the map
Now tourist come from all over around
 
Out in the streets they sell t shirts and hats
And all kinds of what nots and such
The whole country knows where it's at
It's even grown in size as much
 
The tourist come and the tourist go
Me and daddy visit now and then
Everytime we do we laugh to ourselves
And we always leave with a grin
 
The moral of this story? 
Well, alright I'll let you know
What goes up must always come down
Well, sometimes
Even UFO's. 


UFO Abduction-, 
  Lost all sense of time
  , 
     My mind is fuzzy
     , 
        Like I drank too much wine-, 
           Don’t know what really happened
           , 
              Nothing seems clear
              , 
                 I’m not sure what day it is-, 
                     Can you tell me the year-? ? ? 

‘Feel like a forgotten soul
, 
   Swimmin’ in a black hole

       Where was I -, where did I go

           Can someone tell me-, 
                 Does anyone know
                 ? ? ? 

‘Can’t say it was a dream-, 
   Cause a dream feels real-, 
      This trip was strange

            No-one will believe

He focused on the waters. Above, an 
Overhanging vista: layers of hues
Were blending in complexity, 
Tuning in the sky's allure – the blues

Had darkened overhead, revealing 
What he really sought - the minor streak
Could not have been a meteor.
An easy thrum had underlined a sleek

And ever-growing yellow core, 
Pursued by dancing tails of teasing fire; 
His hopeful eyes adapting, peering, 
Smoothing out the contrast. A glorious choir

Trilled inside the power plant, 
Harmonising in the pitch of black.
The trail of dazzling effluence had
Harkened him to bend, arch his back; 

Give his disbelieving eyes a
Sense of concept, thus assimilate
The aviating UFO.
For many barren years he had to wait

For such a prize: a form unknown –
Unique to Man – for him to see it land  
Atop the shore. The underside
Received a gentle nudge from running sand, 

Frantic in the wavelets.  He launched, 
Lurching, surging down in salutation, 
Bidding all an earthly welcome -
Overcome by his hallucination.

Ugasi svetlo, slusaj me nocas
Kako recima ovim ludujem
Ugasi svetlo i ponavljaj za mnom
Jer sve sto ti kazem zelim da cujem

Translation: 

Turn Off The Light

Turn of the light, listen tonight to me
Going crazy through these words
Turn off the light and repeat after me
For everything I tell you I wish to hear


Handsome guys get girls that are pretty
Other guys make it cause they're clever and witty
But the only love I ever got I got out of pity cause I'm the ugliest man in town
Yeah I drive down the street in a Roys Rolls car
Use hundred dollar bills when I light my cigar
But you know folks that really don't get you very far
When you're the ugliest man in town
There was a note on the doorstep where I was found
Is said this poor child weighs eleven pounds
So bring him up healthy and welthy and sound
Keep his back to the light don't let him turn around
Yeah all you women you're heartless and cold all you want is my silver and gold
Don't you know I've got a beautiful soul though I'm the ugliest man in town
Yeah I'm so ugly I gotta shave in the dark
The kids start to cry when I walk through the park
The clock stop tickin' and dogs start to bark whenever I come around
Oh oh oh I walk down the street the girls all hiss me
If I died tomorrow not one of them would miss me
Only reason they ball me is they can't stand to kiss me
I'm the ugliest man in town oh yeah the ugliest man in townlife lived on it’s ugliness
ugly is our devilish diktats
duteous dwelling-is it the birthright
noble I am born, with faith-reborn

Cost of freedom cannot be your blood
Nor can I shed it to glorify my existence-

Into any blissful land lord can be enslaven
Enlightening can be a mere far-cry
Dies the peace-
Cries the peace-
Under the dying sun
The bleeding fingers write

Can you buy me a peace

What lurks you to say
I love you - nomore

Everyday brightens up with another night
And every night I wait-

Mornings of life mourning
Singing farewell song
cowardly again shall be the birth
Dastardly acts dogmatised 
Life lived on it’s ugliness
Noble I am born
With faith-reborn


Ugly said it all.  
I played with light, 
Smeared the glass, 
Blurred my vision -
Still an arse, my face.

I drank a little more, 
Talked it up - tanked up! 
Still the hideous whore
Was howling in disdain, 

For Ugly stared again.

F**ked up, I gave up -
Took a hefty pill.

Ugly died an ill.

Once, I danced; 
Under the cloudless canopy, 
With a dream of yours, 
What a joyous moment it was! 
I danced and danced like a peacock, 
Thought, you will come. . 
Ah! panorama of yours', blinded, 
Spotting such a joy, 
Clouds came and poured, 
Cloths were wet but I was dry 
I Opened my eyes, 
You were not present! 
Abandoned the dance, 
And in grief, cried I.
O! Disappointment, 
'You're the ugly legs of peacock'Uh oh, when Mommy’s on her knees
in front of me it’s clear, 
she has something that she wants to say
that I won’t want to hear.

(Did I hit my sister? 
Did I maybe tell a lie? 
Did I forget to make my bed?) 
This time, I don’t know why.

At least she doesn’t stand and yell
the way some grownups do, 
or get right in my face
to tell me what to do -

(Did I spill my milk? 
Did I do bad in school? 
Did I forget to clean a mess? 
Did I somehow break a rule?) 

Sometimes, I know what I did wrong
and I tell her, there and then.
It helps to say I’m sorry
and I won’t do that again, 

but this time, I don’t have a clue
to what I might have done.
Hey - I just got a hug and kiss! 
This time it was    just     for     fun

Dead tired from the heat of summer and hungry from the days labor 
Had I closed early today, I wouldn’t be wandering the streets 
The street is quiet as a grave, not a life in sight
Fireflies ahead headed north
The crickets sing along and scary little bunnies hop the other way
I head on south to find food and still not a life in sight
Slight thump and I freeze under the sycamore tree
Clutch my purse tight I did
Look left, look right what was that? 
Ever slight breeze out from the south
The branches on the sycamore trees are pointing the other way
Around the corner oddly enough stark raving mad dogs in my face
Had I read the writing on the wall, I would have gone the other way

-----------------------
The leaves they were crisped and sere -
The leaves they were withering and sere;
It was night in the lonesome October
Of my most immemorial year;
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
In the misty mid region of Weir -
It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

Here once, through an alley Titanic,
Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul -
Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll -
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole -
That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole.

Our talk had been serious and sober,
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere -
Our memories were treacherous and sere, -
For we knew not the month was October,
And we marked not the night of the year -
(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
We noted not the dim lake of Auber -
(Though once we had journey down here),
Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

And now, as the night was senescent,
And star-dials pointed to morn -
As the star-dials hinted of morn -
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born,
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn -
Astarte's bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn.

And I said - "She is warmer than Dian:
She rolls through an ether of sighs -
She revels in a region of sighs:
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
And has come past the stars of the Lion
To point us the path to the skies -
To the Lethean peace of the skies -
Come up, in despite of the Lion,
To shine on us with her bright eyes -
Come up through the lair of the Lion,
With love in her luminous eyes


But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
Said - "Sadly this star I mistrust -
Her pallor I strangely mistrust: -
Oh, hasten! - oh, let us not linger!
Oh, fly! - let us fly! - for we must

"
In terror she spoke, letting sink her
Wings until they trailed in the dust -
In agony sobbed, letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust -
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

I replied - "This is nothing but dreaming:
Let us on by this tremulous light!
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
With Hope and in Beauty to-night! -
See! - it flickers up the sky through the night!
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
And be sure it will lead us aright -
We safely may trust to a gleaming,
That cannot but guide us aright,
Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night


Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
And tempted her out of her gloom -
And conquered her scruples and gloom;
And we passed to the end of the vista,
But were stopped by the door of a tomb -
By the door of a legended tomb;
And I said - "What is written, sweet sister,
On the door of this legended tomb?"
She replied - "Ulalume - Ulalume -
‘Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!"

Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere -
As the leaves that were withering and sere,
And I cried - "It was surely October
On this very night of last year
That I journeyed - I journeyed down here -
That I brought a dread burden down here!
On this night of all nights in the year,
Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber -
This misty mid region of Weir -
Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber, -
This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir


"fuck YOU! 
you've wrecked my supposed self-esteem

maybe when I'm older i'll know what self-esteem is
and how it can never be wrecked. 

and i'll even be grateful for the lesson you pushed on me

but not fucking yet, OK

He tried to spit out the truth;
Dry-mouthed at first,
He drooled and slobbered in the end;
Truth dribbling his chin. 


It little profits that an idle king, 
By this still hearth, among these barren crags, 
Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole 
Unequal laws unto a savage race, 
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. 
I cannot rest from travel; I will drink 
Life to the lees.  All times I have enjoy'd 
Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those 
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when 
Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades 
Vext the dim sea.  I am become a name; 
For always roaming with a hungry heart 
Much have I seen and known,-- cities of men 
And manners, climates, councils, governments, 
Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,-- 
And drunk delight of battle with my peers, 
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. 
I am a part of all that I have met; 
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' 
Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades 
For ever and for ever when I move. 
How dull it is to pause, to make an end, 
To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! 
As tho' to breathe were life!  Life piled on life 
Were all too little, and of one to me 
Little remains; but every hour is saved 
>From that eternal silence, something more, 
A bringer of new things; and vile it were 
For some three suns to store and hoard myself, 
And this gray spirit yearning in desire 
To follow knowledge like a sinking star, 
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. 
This is my son, mine own Telemachus, 
to whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,-- 
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill 
This labor, by slow prudence to make mild 
A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees 
Subdue them to the useful and the good. 
Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere 
Of common duties, decent not to fail 
In offices of tenderness, and pay 
Meet adoration to my household gods, 
When I am gone.  He works his work, I mine. 
There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail; 
There gloom the dark, broad seas.  My mariners, 
Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,-- 
That ever with a frolic welcome took 
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed 
Free hearts, free foreheads,-- you and I are old; 
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil. 
Death closes all; but something ere the end, 
Some work of noble note, may yet be done, 
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks; 
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep 
Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends. 
'T is not too late to seek a newer world. 
Push off, and sitting well in order smite 
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds 
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths 
Of all the western stars, until I die. 
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; 
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, 
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. 
Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' 
We are not now that strength which in old days 
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,-- 
One equal temper of heroic hearts, 
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will 
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. 

Bez razloga i namera
Bez povratka i razuma
Kao dete, kao ludak
Volim jer umem

You dont understand
Life never turns out as planned
So why do I try
To make somethin' of my life! 
No-one really cares
And im breakin' down in tears
But no-one stops to see
Whats wrong with me.
Bad dreams never end
And a broken heart is hard to mend.
But I wont run away
And I can live another day, 
With ocean waves inside my head
I relax my mind to go to bed
I say a prayer as I lay
The next day its all the same. 
Why cant life be just a game? 
Press restart and start again, 
In life death is the only end. 


I grasped, 
clawed through layers of love and want: 
I'm desperate -  we're disparate.

I must a blend assign to bind us both together -
let us meld forever in a settling song -
not the rawness of your animal - 
an idee fixe on self, gorging at a breast; 

you cannot as my angst behave - for you I gave! 
you're part of mine in genes and memes
from cream of him and egg of me; 
we are as three - 
though heavy do you loll upon my frame, 
commanding this, demanding that.

Should you tear a gash of depth across my skin
it bears the inner me, 
or dare to open up my cranium 
and let the flowing sea of 
everything I am discharge into your world -

my own peculiar mix of human essence -
memories; harmonies; 
wannabes; mimicries; 
my very sexuality! that writhes in dreams
of day and night, fuelling tumults of emotion  
simmering under valves, controlled by other valves
and valves that let my heart resound in thuds -
that you would actually snub for profit on your ego; 

and should you focus on my heart, 
dissect my chambers wide apart 
and let it bleed away my life -
deny the meaning of my role, 
resign my grey and hoary soul to 
wraith or ghost or fading shadow
stretching out a mighty mediocrity, 

then what do YOU become? 

I could only know this if 
I did the same to you
and let your fleshy guts of life and being
enlighten me upon their cold escape.

So let me study deep your selfish eyes
to glean the mind that hides within; 
but all I see are my unanswered pleas, 
discounted, jaded, wearing thin.

Like some school master, kind in being stern, 
Who hears the children crying o’er their slates
And calling, "Help me master! " yet helps not, 
Since in his silence and refusal lies
Unheeding many prayers.  He is not deaf
To any cry sent up from earnest hearts, 
He hears and strengthens when He must deny.
He sees us weeping over life’s hard sums
But should He give us the key and dry our tears
What would it profit us when school were done
And not one lesson mastered? 
			What a world
Where this if all our prayers were answered.  Not
In famed Pandora’s box were such vast ills
As lie in human hearts.  Should our desires
And come back as events shaped to our wish
What chaos would result! 
			In my fierce youth
I sighed out a breath enough to move a fleet
Voicing wild prayers to heaven for fancied boons
Which were denied; and that denial bends
My knee to prayers of gratitude each day
Of my maturer years.  Yet from those prayers
I rose always regirded for the strife
And conscious of new strength.  Pray on, sad heart, 
That which thou pleadest for may not be given
But in the lofty altitude where souls
Thou shalt find help to bear thy daily lot
Which is not elsewhere found. 

Not aware of anyone, 
glancing down my way.
I'm dancing to the music, 
the feeling hard to say.

A strange sort of happiness, 
running through my veins, 
but yet powerful emotions, 
going through my brain.

The cause of taking it, 
just unbearable to me.
Still I'm being absent-minded, 
and unbelievably happy.

The lights flashing crazy, 
Playing games with my mind.
The music so alluring, 
Leaving myself behind.

One little pill can't hurt.
It kept going through my head.
But to collapse with no warning, 
could have turned me up dead.

Why I didn't listen, 
I think I'll never know
But the truth is in the open, 
and the pain with never go. 

a butterfly had
got stuck high up in the moon
lost all its color


Fish drowned in the sea 
And bird fell from the tree 
Elephants began to fly 
And money rained from the sky 
Bullock pulled the plane 
And car lifted the crane 
Lions started bleating 
And goats started roaring 
Servant fired his maid 
And Hitesh became a poet great. 

O love, 
your fire a lightning strike, 
burning, searing-
your compassion unbound, 
heavy like evening rain, 
refreshing, 
living.
My lover-
I love you. 


Let's cover the distance
between the horizons of our feelings
and meet there where downcast eyes cross, 
eyes wounded by the bitter hope's burden.
Come and hear
silence's agony which gaged the words
enclosed in opposing laying trenches
trembling lest seen be the penury
of tackling for life's  ascent.
Let's admit
that time is mutated, 
it does not anymore run the way known, 
let's accept
that future is quenched from the map
of safe cloudless navigation
and is granted to maps
of uncertain timeless senses. 

After I draw my last breath
and finally depart from this earth
when the undertaker
lays my body to rest
in peace in a casket
and lowers it into the ground
would the sound
of 'weeping and wailing'
be that of lament or
it would be a sound of content? 

What would the pastor say
when he'd finally stand up and pray? 
would the songs sang reflect
the gloomy nature of the mood
or they'd all be cheerful and good
and pleasing to the ear? 
or hurtful to hear? 
on that fateful day
what would people say
about me when I'm gone? 
will they even take time to mourn
because I'd have met my intimely end? 


I know there'll be no dry eye
when i die, but when they cry, 
will they cry tears or sorrow
or will the tears that stream
down their faces be tears of joy? 

Pardon me for being so pessimistic
but, it's uncanning
and often times mind boggling
and a shocking revelation to learn
that the people you
thought loved you
actually resented you! 
and that uncertainty one carries
with them to the grave

Some tend to find the bad in everything, 
That another says or does, 
Not looking for any of the good they do, 
Just complaining- just because.

Just because there are them that will listen, 
And play right into their hands, 
Uncharitable offending words consumed, 
This seems to be the sins of an uncharitable man. 

Finding fault in almost everything, 
Those things which for them don’t comply, 
And even if they did somewhat agree-they’d find a reason to deny. 

Pulling the mote from within their brothers’ eye, 
Yet sets a beam within their own, 
Hypocrites only seeing the negative, 
Of which they themselves have sinfully grown.

For with what judgment you shall judge, 
So shall you come to be judged, 
For which He might give your conscious His gentles of nudge. 

Hail, Columby!
Now let me die.
Fling the chains into the ribber --
Lay de burden by;
Dar is one who will delibber --
Now let me die.

Ring de Bells in eb'ry steeple!
Raise the Flag on high!
Now let me die.

Bressed days, I lib to see dem,
Hail Columby!
I hab drawn a breff of freedom --
Now let me die.
Ninety years I bore the burden,
Den he heard me cry;
Standin' on de banks ob Jordan --
Now let me die.

Dis is what the war was brought for,
Hail, Columby!
Dis is what our faders fought for --
Now let me die.
Dar's an end to all dis sorrow,
Comin' by and by;
Prayin' for dat bressed morrow --
Now let me die.

I hab seen de rebels beaten,
Hail Columby!
I Hab seen dar boots retreatin', --
Now let me die.
O! dis Union can't be broken,
Dar's no use to try;
Now let me die.

I'll go home a singing "Glory!"
Hail Columby!
Since I heard dis bressed story --
Now let me die.
'Tis de ransom ob de nation,
Drawing' now so nigh;
'Tis de day ob full salbation, --
Now let me die. 

Uncle passed away in sleep
In the wee hours today in peace
The breeze held its sibilant breath
Leaves paused and listened in depth

He was ninety-two, three-fourth blind
Yet, exuberant like a playful child
Never did he mouth a complaint
His smile never ever waned

He lived all alone in a bustling town
As his kin and children worked abroad
He never sought a helping hand
Content full with his own hands

And a maid who came once a day
To cook his food and clean the place
His mood upbeat, infectious grace
Enthralled those who saw his face

The world for him was a shadow play
Delights galore in dance and sway
As he swished and made his way
Silent like a fish in a bay

He moved in and out of his flat
His sense of touch made sure that
He was always on the right spot
With his unfading smile intact

He knew where what was placed
The right elevator button to press
Sense of touch told him well
The exact count in his wallet’s swell

Uncle proved exemplary
To all his contemporaries
He was the best lesson they could have
On graceful aging sans fear of grave

Smiling on his bed he lay
Rustle and winds stilled mid-way
A white lamb stood bleating at his feet
It was death, helpless, uncle had it tricked

It was death, helpless, uncle had it trickedin the dusty atmosphere 
in which everyone suffer from fever; 
where no one can give concentration in there work; 
because due to dusty atmosphere they all feel uncomfortable.

in the dusty environment 
where everyone want a fresh air; 
but no one can get a fresh air; 
because due to dusty atmosphere they all feel uncomfortable.

in the dusty weather 
where everyone want to enjoy that weather; 
but no one can enjoy that weather;

in the dusty sky
where every one want to see the star at night; 
but no one can see that star;

Dazed, confused and perplexed
like someone with their head in the clouds
he takes another peek
at his dusty uncompleted manuscript
and he's traumatized  
by an eerie silence in his mind
because this time round
he's got nothing more to write! 

But. 
he is nevertheless optimistic
and tries to holds on to his pen
for as long as he can
waiting for the moment when
he'd feel inspired to write again

Your puppy licked my hand today 
He doesn't know that you are gone 
I reached down, he came to me 
He ran right into my arms 
 
Unconditional love 
He doesn't know right from wrong 
We could learn a thing or two 
From this puppy in my arms 
 
As I let him lick my hand 
I could only think of you 
So I hugged and loved this creature 
That once did belong to you 
 
It was as if he could know 
Somehow, could sense the hurt inside 
It was as if somehow he knew 
I was about to cry 
 
As I held it in my arms 
As the tears streamed down my face 
Unconditional love, in such a place. 

That which loves unconditionally 
is unconditionally loved. 
If you believe yourself unloved 
you have terms and conditions. 
I love all conditions 
and place none on you. 
I am unconditional love. 

However skilled and strong art thou, my foe, 
However fierce is thy relentless hate
Though firm thy hand, and strong thy aim, and straight
Thy poisoned arrow leaves the bended bow, 
To pierce the target of my heart, ah! know
I am the master yet of my own fate.
Thou canst not rob me of my best estate, 
Though fortune, fame and friends, yea love shall go.

Not to the dust shall my true self be hurled; 
Nor shall I meet thy worst assaults dismayed.
When all things in the balance are well weighed, 
There is but one great. 

danger in the world-
Thou canst not force my soul to wish thee ill, 
That is the only evil that can kill. 

unconsoled
 
In a white milk jug, 
mirrored in the lacquered oak, 
pure white peonies wait, 
buds stir, lean into blowsy sisters, listen.
 
Two men sway, shuffle, 
hold each other in darkstreets, 
lean into a doorway. A crumbled treble voice
Buds cry, a shadow bends in forced submission.
 
three white peonies
float by the window, in three blue bowls.
Small puffs of wind stir.
Blooms sway, unconsoled
by the spare and gentle heartsongs of Satie. 

Tag my words as they are
going for a spin

Crazy I know, but did you
ever think 

That my words are free to
do what they like

Into your electric factory
they go 

Don't blame me I have no 
control over them

But do tell me if they
resonate


The mighty forces of mysterious space
  Are one by one subdued by lordly man.
  The awful lightning that for eons ran
Their devastating and untrammeled race, 
Now bear his messages from place to place
  Like carrier doves.  The winds lead on his van; 
  The lawless elements no longer can
Resist his strength, but yield with sullen grace.

His bold feet scaling heights before untrod, 
  Light, darkness, air and water, heat and cold
   He bids go forth and bring him power and pelf.
And yet though ruler, king and demi-god
  He walks with his fierce passions uncontrolled
   The conquerer of all things – save himself. 

Sometime I think life is over, 
But when I look behind your eyes I can uncover the truth you hide, 
The lies you told me, 
The things I believed, 
But you never knew I can uncover your lies you have told me, 
Uncover your dirty little secret you hide, 
The deaths you have upon me will never end, 
The lies you have told others will never end, 
Its hard to believe the one you love can lie to you and shatter your heart into million pieces, 
I have uncover the truth I seek, 
Uncover the hate I feel, 
You lead me to believe you are the one I love, 
Lead me to think I loved you, 
But in the end I get my heart broken. 

While caution and the wind blows, 
through the earth its share flows.
From end to end the farmer ploughs. 
Unctuous li’l one is caught in throes.

(Friday, June once i lived on pillars in a green house 
boarded by lilacs that rocked voices into weeds. 
i bled an owl's blood 
shredding the grass until i 
rocked in a choir of worms. 
obscene with hands, i wooed the world 
with thumbs 
                        while yo-yos hummed. 
was it an unborn lacquer i peeled? 
the woods, tall as waves, sang in mixed 
tongues that loosened the scalp 
and my bones wrapped in white dust 
returned to echo in my thighs. 

i hear a pulse wandering somewhere 
on vague embankments. 
O are my hands breathing?    I cannot smell the nerves. 
i saw the sun 
ripening green stones for fields. 
O have my eyes run down?    i cannot taste my birth. 

          

now as i move, mouth quivering with silks 
my skin runs soft with eyes. 
descending into my legs, i follow obscure birds 
purchasing orthopedic wings. 
the air is late this summer. 

i peel the spine and flood 
the earth with adolescence. 
O who will pump these breasts?    I cannot waltz my tongue. 

under a soprano sky, a woman sings, 
lovely as chandeliers. 

To slip into your shadow under cover of night.
To follow your footsteps, your shadow at the window.
That shadow at the window is you and no one else;
it's you.
Do not open that window behind whose curtains you're moving.
Shut your eyes.
I'd like to shut them with my lips.
But the window opens and the breeze, the breeze
which strangely balances flame and flag surrounds my escape
with its cloak.
The window opens: it's not you.
I knew it all along. 

Under her dark veil she wrung her hands.
"Why are you so pale today?"
"Because I made him drink of stinging grief
Until he got drunk on it.
How can I forget? He staggered out,
His mouth twisted in agony.
I ran down not touching the bannister

And caught up with him at the gate.
I cried: 'A joke!
That's all it was. If you leave, I'll die.'
He smiled calmly and grimly
And told me: 'Don't stand here in the wind.' 



"It is advisable and true to fall in line
Not a word to be misunderstood and sidelined
As He lives in true spirit and conduct
We only have to pray for new energy to induct
 
He shall take every care
You may stay away or anywhere
He will guide you to the final destiny
This is how deals the merciful, o, lord almighty 

For all future course we look desperately at Him
Not that we have lost faith in sun and its beam
It is divine light that makes us to go all out
Know more and more and seek what is not thought about

You may have everything under his influence
You must surrender with earnestness at once
He is merciful and largely responsible
For all your well being to make you strong and capable


I was in dark wood
Never followed or understood
It was no magic or dry spell
I have human life but not doing well 

There is perfume and fragrance in nature
There are stars and sky for future
They are hanging in the sky
So I need not bother and try

But why I remain indifferent? 
Think about past, future and not of present
Do dead people ever speak? 
This stupid argument makes me sick 

If graves were our pilgrimage 
I should have always remained at gate
Asked for the solution and chosen the path 
But alas! They have gone all ready and breathed last  

Simple prayers grant wisdom
The problems come seldom 
You have vision to tackle 
They come and disappear to settle 

Let us remain under His refuge
Nothing may ever be refused
If at all at any sage, your feel confused
That situation may soon be defused


Under leadership

Turban is our pride
We only shall decide
About its sanctity
So long as blessed by an almighty

See the lion hearted gesture
That has been shown by our Prime Minister 
It has been reciprocated by another Prime Minister
Specially honored on an occasion of marriage of her grand daughter  

In India and Pakistan, the turban has great history behind
The colorful tales are told of many kinds
Sometimes it is related to sacrifice
And sometimes for the fulfillment of promises

How come a prime Minister of hostile country is respecting
The sentiments of another country for testing
Hospitality and durable peace in region
Disregarding the utterances made by the heads of the religion

Country's interest stands supreme
It is difficult to come out of an ego and whims
It is sign of great statesmanship 
To dream for peace under steward leadership


Under magic spell

No, no and no
I did not blow
With the idea of falling in love
I simply stared at sky and drove

But was he touching me again and again? 
In mind, in heart and tried to remain
"Useless may be his attempt" I brushed aside
this was not the time to decide

But what is this? 
Why am I loosing grip? 
What has he to do with my association? 
Now I was feeling confusion

Oh! Rubbish
Let him wish
But I shall not budge from my stand
Let me first understand 

": Love is universal need" I heard him saying
He was slowly swaying
"Yes, yes "I was under magical spell 
I decided to fall for it and tell


The land was not to be red
But it was read
Between lines
To be divine

The land of curse 
To come up with remorse
Who is to be blamed? 
We are all ashamed

Not one side relents
Feelers are sent
Temporary truce is acceptable 
In anticipation for future struggle 

The ear drums have turned insensitive
You have all become selective
"Kill or get killed"
The mistrust is solidly walled 

Neither Jewish people nor Arabs may agree 
Thy will shed heir blood for free
The world has witnessed enough
Who will make now last laugh? 

Humanity has cried a lot
Worst kind of undeclared war is fought
Did you people ever ask? 
What you are fighting for under mask

Palms or no calms
I needed calm
Under the tree with gloom
As tree blossoms with boom

Since years I have dreamed
And beamed
Desires 
Towards seven seas

You could say "Yes"
To face
My gentle manner
With tight love spanner

It has grip
But to keep
Love inferno
With calmness not to go

How come one good female? 
Can excel
In life of man
To make him perfect and human! 

I feel no less
Fortunate on face
As whole of world
Is under my fold


You pressed her breasts so deeply and, 
You remixed the drink for her to drink; 
But she is now under my wings of love! 
For you left her alone afterwards in the cold. 

My apologies to chance for calling it necessity.
My apologies to necessity if I'm mistaken, after all.
Please, don't be angry, happiness, that I take you as my due.
May my dead be patient with the way my memories fade.
My apologies to time for all the world I overlook each second.
My apologies to past loves for thinking that the latest is the first.
Forgive me, distant wars, for bringing flowers home.
Forgive me, open wounds, for pricking my finger.
I apologize for my record of minuets to those who cry from the depths.
I apologize to those who wait in railway stations for being asleep today at five a. 

m.
Pardon me, hounded hope, for laughing from time to time.
Pardon me, deserts, that I don't rush to you bearing a spoonful of water. 
And you, falcon, unchanging year after year, always in the same cage,
your gaze always fixed on the same point in space,
forgive me, even if it turns out you were stuffed.
My apologies to the felled tree for the table's four legs.
My apologies to great questions for small answers.
Truth, please don't pay me much attention.
Dignity, please be magnanimous.
Bear with me, O mystery of existence, as I pluck the occasional thread from your train.
Soul, don't take offense that I've only got you now and then.
My apologies to everything that I can't be everywhere at once.
My apologies to everyone that I can't be each woman and each man.
I know I won't be justified as long as I live,
since I myself stand in my own way.
Don't bear me ill will, speech, that I borrow weighty words,
then labor heavily so that they may seem light. 

Illegal lust, 
Under pretence! 
But, blood came out of your nose and, 
We have to help you solve your problem.

Fertile grounds! 
Prospective; 
To acquire the truth than, to burn in lust.

Hoe, toe, woe, foe, doe, roe, floe, canoe; 
Customs and border control! 
Competitive; 
Noon, neon! 
But, under pretence.

A flattering environment, 
Flawed; 
Weird! 
However, we came in to help you improve on your status. 

Under same roof
Still feel aloof! 
What can be felt differently? 
Not love and feeling really 

Same earth take care
Show the way and future
We breathe oxygen from air
And live in with love pure

So much to dream and so much to endure
Love and pain for lasting more
I shall explain It with more delight
There may be division slight 

The earth stands firm
To provide stand and not turn
Hostile at any time
But provide moon to see sometimes

Clouds may make noise and shower
Earth may look fine and greener 
What have we to do with such change? 
Love each other and manage 

Let us fill rainbow 
In life and allow
The life to shine with nature
There stands our future

The sky may look vast
 With beautiful night to last
The stars and moon may appear 
Lovers may take chance to come near


The noise of the thunder is like the voice of the Almighty! 
But, i am sitting down under the apple tree waiting for the signs in the sky; 
Looking up and, watching thw wonders of life, 
For, the ways of the Creator are far beyond mankind. 

A little prayer is needed to be said on my uplifting; 
And, through the struggles of my life! 
From the hustle and bustle of my life in Africa.
The muse of life! 
With hopes and dreams; 
Trying to make ends meet with the muse of Africa.
Agree, free, tree, referee, degree! 
With the rays of the sun during the day to touch my heart; 
Living with hope without stepping back on my dreams.
The muse of love! 
With the reality of the grief of life; 
And, of the experiences to go through.
The muse of life! 
With sickness, disaapointments and grief; 
Trying very hard to succeed.
The muse of love! 
Under the big mango tree to rest my mind; 
As i laid down in my compound.
The muse of life! 
Through the shape of things and, through the shapes of love; 
Hoping for the roses of love to touch my heart.
The muse of life! 
A person without a kindred is like a tree without roots; 
But, life at times to me was like, 
Weeping virgins in the forest of darkness.
The muse of life! 
With hopes and dreams; 
And, with the spirit of the rainforest of Africa to guide me on. 

Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me,
And turn his merry note
Unto the sweet bird's throat,
Come hither, come hither, come hither:
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather. 

Who doth ambition shun,
And loves to live i' the sun,
Seeking the food he eats,
And pleas'd with what he gets,
Come hither, come hither, come hither:
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather. 

Under the papaya tree they sat
They relived and replayed their childhood days               They were hardly ten years old when they sat there           This time not to enjoy the cashew nuts but to launch a vision A vision of walking their families unity                    To make a better world for their children
A vision for the nation
To make a better world for you and me 
 
They talked about the soiled hands of the society           They talked about competition in looting public funds        They talked about 'diluted' system of education              They talked about the prolific politics and ethnic profiling  

                But
What was their contribution to change? 
What was their next action to good governance?                What was their role in redeeming the moral decadence?        I 'grabbed' a theme for my literary work as this was my world
Darkness fell on them                
They still sat under the papaya tree
Had eaten and drank the traditional 'muratina'             

Had they changed the society? 
Was the discussion a worth course? 
Biblically did they deserve to eat on this day?              Their women had fetched water and firewood                   The girls had done the cooking
The boys brought the animals back from graze lands 
The chicken were back to the poultry house
They ate to fill and  belched
They went to demand the last share of conjugal rights from their tired women What a society unit shame


Like priestly imprisoned poets, 
the poplars of blood have fallen asleep. 
On the hills, the flocks of Bethlehem 
chew arias of grass at sunset. 

The ancient shepherd, who shivers 
at the last martyrdoms of light, 
in his Easter eyes has caught 
a purebred flock of stars. 

Formed in orphanhood, he goes down 
with rumors of burial to the praying field, 
and the sheep bells are seasoned with shadow. 

It survives, the blue warped 
In iron, and on it, pupils shrouded, 
A dog etches its pastoral howl. 

O Thou Great Being! what Thou art,
Surpasses me to know;
Yet sure I am, that known to Thee
Are all Thy works below.

Thy creature here before Thee stands,
All wretched and distrest;
Yet sure those ills that wring my soul
Obey Thy high behest.

Sure, Thou, Almighty, canst not act
From cruelty or wrath!
O, free my weary eyes from tears,
Or close them fast in death!

But, if I must afflicted be,
To suit some wise design,
Then man my soul with firm resolves,
To bear and not repine

This is the place where they all were bred; 
Some of the rafters are standing still; 
Now they are scattered and lost and dead, 
Every one from the old nest fled, 
Out of the shadow of Kiley's Hill. 

Better it is that they ne'er came back -- 
Changes and chances are quickly rung; 
Now the old homestead is gone to rack, 
Green is the grass on the well-worn track 
Down by the gate where the roses clung. 

Gone is the garden they kept with care; 
Left to decay at its own sweet will, 
Fruit trees and flower-beds eaten bare, 
Cattle and sheep where the roses were, 
Under the shadow of Kiley's Hill. 

Where are the children that strove and grew 
In the old homestead in days gone by? 
One is away on the far Barcoo 
Watching his cattle the long year through, 
Watching them starve in the droughts and die. 

One, in the town where all cares are rife, 
Weary with troubles that cramp and kill, 
Fain would be done with the restless strife, 
Fain would go back to the old bush life, 
Back to the shadow of Kiley's Hill. 

One is away on the roving quest, 
Seeking his share of the golden spoil; 
Out in the wastes of the trackless west, 
Wandering ever he gives the best 
Of his years and strength to the hopeless toil. 

What of the parents? That unkempt mound 
Shows where they slumber united still; 
Rough is their grave, but they sleep as sound 
Out on the range as in holy ground, 
Under the shadow of Kiley's Hill. 

What a terrible night! Does the Night, I wonder-
The Night, with her black veil down to her feet
Like an ordained nun, know what lies under
That awful, motionless, snow-white sheet?
The winds seem crazed, and, wildly howling,
Over the sad earth blindly go.
Do they and the dark clouds over them scowling,
Do they dream or know?


Why, here in the room, not a week or over-
Tho' it must be a week, not more than one-
(I cannot reckon of late or discover
When one day is ended or one begun),
But here in this room we were laughing lightly,
And glad was the measure our two hearts beat;
And the royal face that was smiling so brightly
Lies under that sheet.


I know not why-it is strange and fearful,
But I am afraid of her, lying there;
She who was always so gay and cheerful,
Lying so still with that stony stare:
She who was so like some grand sultana,
Fond of color and glow and heat,
To lie there clothed in that awful manner
In a stark white sheet.


She who was made out of summer blisses,
Tropical, beautiful, gracious, fair,
To lie and stare at my fondest kisses-
Shriek, oh, wind! for the world is lonely;
Trail cloud-veil to the nun Night's feet.
For all that I prized in life is only
A shape and a sheet. 

My neighbor's wife is leaving him - My palms are wrinkling 

unnoticeably- - - All of this Earthly Paradise is some

sort of strange Golden Ratio

math equation; This Paradise of Whisp and 

Frolic; of Orion's Belt; of Heroin, 

Women; of Heinekens and White Russians.  

Folded within a Hell, 

wrapped up inside a

meaningless Purgatory, breathing

Chaos and INFINITE Darwinian Order

throbbing, angry red

Chemical Sky. 

Set the foot down with distrust upon the crust of the
	world—it is thin.
Moles are at work beneath us; they have tunneled the
	sub-soil
With separate chambers; which at an appointed knock
Could be as one, could intersect and interlock.  We walk
	on the skin
Of life.  No toil
Of rake or hoe, no lime, no phosphate, no rotation of
	crops, no irrigation of the land,
Will coax the limp and flattened grain to stand
On that bad day, or feed to strength the nibbled root's of
	our nation.
Ease has demoralized us, nearly so, we know
Nothing of the rigours of winter:  The house has a roof
	against—the car a top against—the snow.
All will be well, we say, it is  a bit, like the rising of the
	sun,
For our country to prosper; who can prevail against us?
No one.
The house has a roof; but the boards of its floor are
	rotting, and hall upon hall
The moles have built their palace beneath us, we have
	not far to fall

"Oh dear children you do underline, 
While you read your books in fine.
You sing and dance in cheer ever,

Oh my beloved     I speak of      the absolute     jewels.

Dwelling in     place     for example.

In fluted listenings.

In panting waters     human-skinned     to the horizon.

Muzzled     the deep.

Fermenting     the surface.

Wrecks left at the bottom, yes.

Space     birdless. 

Light on it a woman on her knees-her having kneeled everywhere 
already.


Back there its river ripped into pieces, length gone, buried in parts, in 
sand.

Believe me       I speak now for the sand.

There are consequences to everything 
Intentions have their purpose -
So don't deny
Or justify -
Just accept what is; 

Momentary flights of fantasy 
Highlight the mundane world
Of real life, 
Of real strife -
Without dreams, we die; 

Every little now and then
This life  bestows a gift, 
A brilliant light
To set things right -
Fresh life to a dying heart; 

Be grateful for the blessings bright
Accept them as they are, 
They're sent to you
To see you through -
They are not yours to hold


Understand.
 

hat if you came back now 
To our new world, the city roaring 
There on the old peaceful camping place 
Of your red fires along the quiet water, 
How you would wonder 
At towering stone gunyas high in air 
Immense, incredible; 
Planes in the sky over, swarms of cars 
Like things frantic in flight. 

Real as a dream
What shall I do with this great opportunity to fly?
What is the interpretation of this planet, this moon?
if I can dream that I dream / and dream anything dreamable / can I dream
I am awake / and why do that?
When I dream in a dream that I wake / up what
happens when I try to move?
I dream that I move
and the effort moves and moves
till I move / and my arm hurts
Then I wake up / dismayed / I was dreaming / I was waking
when I was dreaming still / just now.
and try to remember next time in dreams
that I am in dreaming.
And dream anything I want when I'm awaken.
When I'm in awakeness what do I desire?
I desire to fulfill my emotional belly.
My whole body my heart in my fingertops thrill with some old fulfillments.
Pages of celestial rhymes burning fire-words
unconsumable but disappear.
Arcane parchments my own and the universe the answer.
Belly to Belly and knee to knee.
The hot spurt of my body to thee and thee
old boy / dreamy Earl / you Prince of Paterson / now king of me / lost

Haledon

first dream that made me take down my pants
urgently to show the cars / auto tracks / rolling down avenue hill.
That far back what do I remember / but the face of the leader of the gang
was blond / that loved me / one day on the steps of his house blocks away
all afternoon I told him about my magic Spell
I can do anything I want / palaces millions / chemistry sets / chicken

coops / white horses

stables and torture basements / I inspect my naked victims
chained upside down / my fingertips thrill approval on their thighs
white hairless cheeks I may kiss all I want
at my mercy. on the racks.
I pass with my strong attendants / I am myself naked
bending down with my buttocks out
for their smacks of reproval / o the heat of desire
liek shit in my asshole. The strange gang
across the street / thru the grocerystore / in the wood alley / out in the open

on the corner

Because I lied to the Dentist about that chickencoop roofing / slate stolen off 

his garage

by me and the boy I loved who would punish me if he knew
what I loved him.
That now I have had that boy back in another blond form
Peter Orlovsky a Chinese teenager in Bangkok ten years twenty years
Jo Army on the campus / white blond loins / my mouth hath kisses
full of his cock / my ass burning / full of his cock
all that I do desire. In dream and awake
this handsome body mine / answered
all I desired / intimate loves / open eyed / revealed at last / clothes on the 

floor 
Underwear the most revealing stripped off below the belly button in bed.
That's that / yes yes / the flat cocks the red pricks the gentle public hair / 

alone with me

my magic spell. My power / what I desire alone / what after thirty years / 
I got forever / after thirty years / satisfied enough with Peter / with all I

wanted

with many men I knew one generation / our sperm passing
into our mouths and bellies / beautiful when I love / given.
Now the dream oldens / I olden / my hair a year long / my thirtyeight 

birthday approaching.

I dream I
am bald / am disappearing / the campus unrecognizable / Haledon Avenue
will be covered with neon / motels / Supermarkets / iron
the porches and woods changed when i go back / to see Earl again
He'll be bald / fleshy father / I could pursie him further in the garage
If there's still a garage on the hill / on the planet / when I get back.

From Asia.

If I could even remember his name or his face / or find him
When I was ten / perhaps he exists in some form.
With a belly and a belt and an auto
Whatever his last name / I never knew / in the phonebook / the Akashic

records.

I'll write my Inspiration for all Mankind to remember,
My Idea, the secret cave / in the clothes closet / that house probably down
Nothing to go back to / everything's gone / only my idea
that's disappearing / even in dreams / gray dust piles / instant annihilation
of World War II and all its stainless steel shining-mouthed cannons
much less me and my grammar school kisses / I never kissed in time / 
and go on kissing in dream and out on the street / as if it were for ever.
No forever left! Even my oldest forever gone, in Bangkok, in Benares,
swept up with words and bodies / all into the brown Ganges / 
passing the burning grounds and / into the police state.
My mind, my mind / you had six feet of Earth to hoe
Why didn't you remember and plant the seed of Law and gather the sprouts

of What?

the golden blossoms of what idea? If I dream that I dream / what dream
should I dream next? Motorcycle rickshaws / parting lamp shine / little

taxis / horses hoofs

on this Saigon midnight street. Angkor Wat ahead and the ruined city's old

Hindu faces

and there was a dream about Eternity. What should I dream when I wake?
What's left to dream, more Chinese meat? More magic Spells? More youths

to love before I change & disappear?

More dream words? For now that I know that I am dreaming / 
What next for you Allen? Run down to the Presidents Palace full of Morphine
The cocks crowing / in the street / Dawn trucks / What is the question?
Do I need sleep, now that there's light in the window?
I'll go to sleep. Signing off until / the next idea / the moving van arrives

empty

at the Doctor's house full of Chinese furniture. 

Hey, Mommy, what’s a tuffet? 
Do we have a tuffet, too? 
Little Miss Muffett sat on one.
What does a tuffet do? 

What’s that stuff she’s eating? 
The words say: curds and whey.
It looks like lumpy oatmeal.
Does she eat that every day? 

Why’d she take off running
When the spider sat beside her? 
Ohhh.  I'll bet I know. 
It was a big old BARKING spider

I didn’t get much sleep last night 
thinking about underwear 
Have you ever stopped to consider 
underwear in the abstract 
When you really dig into it 
some shocking problems are raised 
Underwear is something we all have to deal with 
Everyone wears
some kind of underwear 
Even Indians wear underwear 
Even Cubans
wear underwear
The Pope wears underwear I hope 
The Governor of Louisiana wears underwear
I saw him on TV 
He must have had tight underwear 
He squirmed a lot 
Underwear can really get you in a bind 
You have seen the underwear ads for men and women 
so alike but so different 
Women’s underwear holds things up 
Men’s underwear holds things down 
Underwear is one thing 
men and women do have in common 
Underwear is all we have between us 
You have seen the three-color pictures 
with crotches encircled 
to show the areas of extra strength 
with three-way stretch 
promising full freedom of action 
Don’t be deceived 
It’s all based on the two-party system 
which doesn’t allow much freedom of choice 
the way things are set up 
America in its Underwear 
struggles thru the night 
Underwear controls everything in the end 
Take foundation garments for instance 
They are really fascist forms 
of underground government 
making people believe 
something but the truth 
telling you what you can of can’t do 
Did you ever try to get around a girdle 
Perhaps Non-Violent Action 
is the only answer 
Did Gandhi wear a girdle? 
Did Lady Macbeth wear a girdle? 
Was that why Macbeth murdered sleep?

And the spot she was always rubbing -
Was it really her underwear?
Modern anglosaxon ladies
must have huge guilt complexes
always washing and washing and washing
Out damned spot
Underwear with spots very suspicious
Underwear with bulges very shocking
Underwear on clothesline a great flag of freedom
Someone has escaped his Underwear
May be naked somewhere
Help!
But don’t worry
Everybody’s still hung up in it
There won’t be no real revolution
And poetry still the underwear of the soul
And underwear still covering
a multitude of faults 

in the geological sense -
strange sedimentary stones, inscrutable cracks! 
If I were you I’d keep aside 
an oversize pair of winter underwear 
Do not go naked into that good night 
And in the meantime 
keep calm and warm and dry 
No use stirring ourselves up prematurely 
‘over Nothing’
Move forward with dignity 
hand in vest 
Don’t get emotional 
And death shall have no dominion 
There’s plenty of time my darling 
Are we not still young and easy? 
Don’t shout. 

Of all my verse, like not a single line;   
But like my title, for it is not mine.   
That title from a better man I stole:   
Ah, how much better, had I stol'n the whole. 

Heat filling my cheeks, 
My heart pounding quickly
Your smile leaving me bewildered
And my soul, driving on forever

The sweet scent that lingers from your skin
The hardness of your chest
As you hold me close to your heart
Your laughter, is enough to carry me through the day
And look forward to tomorrow

Words filling my mind
And hanging off your tongue, 
Your eyes a beautiful ocean
A never-ending world of wonder
Of new reality and uncertainty

So, live in the moment
And just take my breath away
Leave me hanging on the edge
Then, when the fall is close
Grab my hand and never let it go
Then, bring me back up again
And hold me tight, 
Let the air come back to me
But with a new taste
And let these words suddenly become
Undescribeable.

'T was far away and long ago,
When I was but a dreaming boy,
This fairy tale of love and woe
Entranced my heart with tearful joy;
And while with white Undine I wept,
Your spirit, -- ah, how strange it seems, --
Was cradled in some star, and slept,
Unconscious of her coming dreams. 

Focus on this. , don't deviate. ., 
Can't be scattered. ., concentrate. ., 
I want your Undivided Attention. ., 
Your Undivided Attention.

Don't let outside interference. ., 
Lead you in another direction. ., 
Like a laser beam. ., 
Point out a specific theme. ., 

This improves your retention. ., 
And my only intention. ., 
Is that I need your Undivided Attention. ., 
Your Undivided Attention. 




To a Creole Lady

In the perfumed country which the sun caresses, 
I knew, under a canopy of crimson trees 
And palms from which indolence rains into your eyes, 
A Creole lady whose charms were unknown.

Her complexion is pale and warm; the dark enchantress 
Affects a noble air with the movements of her neck. 
Tall and slender, she walks like a huntress; 
Her smile is calm and her eye confident.

If you went, Madame, to the true land of glory, 
On the banks of the Seine or along the green Loire, 
Beauty fit to ornament those ancient manors,

You'd make, in the shelter of those shady retreats, 
A thousand sonnets grow in the hearts of poets, 
Whom your large eyes would make more subject than your slaves.

-------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------


To a Colonial Lady 

In scented countries by the sun caressed 
I've known, beneath a tent of purple boughs, 
And palmtrees shedding slumber as they drowse, 
A creole lady with a charm unguessed.

She's pale, and warm, and duskily beguiling; 
Nobility is moulded in her neck; 
Slender and tall she holds herself in check, 
An huntress born, sure-eyed, and quiet-smiling.

Should you go, Madam, to the land of glory
Along the Seine or Loire, where you would merit
To ornament some mansion famed in story,

Your eyes would bum in those deep-shaded parts, 
And breed a thousand rhymes in poets' hearts, 
Tamed like the negro slaves that you inherit.

To a Creole Lady

In that perfumed country caressed by the sun,
I have known, under a canopy of purple trees 
And palms raining idleness upon the eyes, 
A creole lady of private beauty.

Her shade is pale and warm; this brown enchantress 
Has gracefully mannered airs in her neck; 
Large and sinuous, walking like a huntress, 
Her smile is silent and her eyes secure.

If you should go, Madam, to the true country of glory,
On the banks of the Seine or of the green Loire,
Fair lady fit to decorate ancient mansions,

In some shady and secluded refuge, you would awake 
A thousand sonnets in the hearts of poets, 
Whom your great eyes would make more subject than your Blacks.




Je travaille beaucoup et je vis beaucoup moins que je ne pourrais, mais la lune est belle et il y a 
des etoiles bleues.  

Je vis la chanson pure de mon coeur.

   _ Garcia Lorca a Llanos Medinor, le Novembre, 

Une fois tu etais jeune.
Maintenant, voutee dans le froid, 
Personne ne se soucie
Que tu es vielle.

Une fois tu etais belle.
Maintenant, dans la rue, 
Personne ne se rappelle
Que tu avais des levres doux.

Oh, vielle femme toute dessechee
De la Rue Fontaine, 
Personne sauf la mort
Te baisera encore.

      - ' Parisian Beggar Woman'. Langston Hughes. From 'The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes', op. cit. p. (Poems  . 

I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times-
In life after life, in age after age, forever.
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,
That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,
In life after life, in age after age, forever.

Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, it's age-old pain,
It's ancient tale of being apart or together.
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:
You become an image of what is remembered forever.

You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.
At the heart of time, love of one for another.
We have played along side millions of lovers, shared in the same 
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.

Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you
The love of all man’s days both past and forever:
Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours – 
And the songs of every poet past and forever. 

Exhausted, he stands
waiting in the darkened space that once
was his home; a chilling shroud of desperation
descends upon his being. He dare not even consider
the possibility she will not return- afraid, if he did
he might soon disappear into the emptiness. His
mind whirls about itself and he just keeps thinking: 
'Ever present will be her absence; ever absent will be 
her presence.' Interminable night becomes endless day.
Eventually, he sits down. 

On Evidence, on Deeds, on Bills,
On Copyhold, on Loans, on Wills,
Lawyers great books indite;
The creaking of their busy quills
I've never heard on Right. 

The trumpet is ready to  blow
Dead seaweeds impatient to smile
Just awaiting for raining

But the pregnant cloud is trapped
And caged with guile

Greedy kings are capable enough to
Activate unfair combat


He cant blame pain for the things going on in his life
He can however blame me for a big part of the pain
But he doesnt have to let it consume him
Pain is a fire that burns on our soul's weakness and leaves our bodies ashes on the rotten ground
And the only way to put it out is to cut it off its resources
Eliminate the weakness
Before it melts the strength we have left making us in the process objects of destruction
Before it empties us from everything that makes us who we are
He has reached a point where the pain inside of him has grown to become an uncontrollable fire
And it's eating his common sense away
Piece by piece
It's drying his eyes by drinking the tears that cascade from them
And it will not stoo
Unless he finds a way to stop it
It is in no way an easy task
But if there is one thing I have learned in life
And after all the shit I've been in
It would be that pain is our slave
And not the other way around
We can use the pain to make us stronger
And we can use it as a torch to light our path as we venture through life
But something we must prohibit is to let it get the best of us
If it does
The cost would be more pricey than the richest man can pay
What is worse than losing a father in the time of most dire need? 
I am a billion percent sure that losing a girl who lost herself first isn't the answer to that question
Let him grieve the loss he believes is the worst
And I do not wish him feeling any kind of loss that is worse
Eventhough there are some to which losing a relationship is irrelevant
But I also do not want him to grieve for a lost love still alive
I grieved the loss of my own father whom I needed way more than he might need any girl in his life
And despite it being true that I harmed myself in the process of doing so and for a bunch of other reasons
Pain did not get the best of me
What I did - what I was and still am capable of doing - to myself are not the best of me
And neither are what he is doing
I want him to realize where he'll reach if he lives on that way
I need him to forget the pain
And use it for his own benifit
Let him mold it into the form he sooner better than later wants to become
Pain is everywhere it is inevitable
But that doesn't make it the end of the world
The end of the world is peaceful
And as long as he is not at peace with neither himself nor the people around him
The ghost of pain will haunt him for a long long time
And its weight will with no doubt drown him
In the ocean of despair
Of which the surface is almost unreachable


After lifting the fingerprints of bloodbath
a bushfire starts, engulfing contradictions, 
the gulf  between erosion of truth and
survivors appears widening. Tiny ants smell

blood, exfoliation begins, from
nameless earth for the exodus of barefoot, 
the epic of tragedy, something in the debris is left
for acetic reminder, a death reunion.

The pain starts the saddest saga of human
suffering, a salt lake melting in each eye and then in
every courtroom the defence for the crimes, bail -
out by the buried dark sniffing of fecundity.

The night wraps me, the land of my birth
haunts in its greenness, the wounded sea bids
refugees to hostile shores, a cracked sun
welcomes the lost umbical cords.

 

Unfinished is the fine tuning of me, 
as I perform in this human drama, 
which is covered by a spiritual mystery.

Participating without a script, 
I’m stumbling forward in a lifelong excursion, 
although I’m not fully equipped.

In this paradise, that’s known as Earth, 
I’m a curious child of wonderment
and working towards my supernatural rebirth.

Despite my growth of understanding, 
I will always be an adolescent boy of His –

Unfinished is the beauty of my tapestry
until I can achieve the final conclusion
that is- Permanently me. 

If I should stay another day
I'd lose myself in you -
Not that that would be a crime
But I've got things to do; 

Perhaps one day my life will change
My little tasks be done -
And then with freedom's blessing
I'll ride off to meet the sun; 

And will you come to meet me there? 
Or join me on my way -
Experience the journey
Hand in hand we'll run and play; 

The future beckons brightly
Every day begins anew -
He went and saved the best for last

My life begins with you. 


People tell me
To just let it go
Move on without
Looking back to
A time so long ago

But I can't just do that
How am I to get
Over a time
That only happened
In my mind

There's so many things
We had planned to do
Dreams unfinished
I wanted to
Fly down to Rio with you

Now it all vanished
Into the dark
Life has torn us apart
You are going places
I am stuck in my heart

I wonder if we
Ever get to be
Together again
To finish what we
Once began


WE HAVE loved each other in this time twenty years
And with such love as few men have in them even for
One or for the marriage month or the hearing of
Three nights' carts in the street but it will leave them:
We have been lovers the twentieth year now:
Our bed has been made in many houses and evenings:
The apple-tree moves at the window in this house:
There were palms rattled the night through in one:
In one there were red tiles and the sea's hours:
We have made our bed in the changes of many months and the
Light of the day is still overlong in the windows
Till night shall bring us the lamp and one another:
Those that have seen her have no thought what she is:
Her face is clear in the sun as a palmful of water:
Only by night and in love are the dark winds on it
I wrote this poem that day when I thought
Since we have loved we two so long together
Shall we have done together all love gone?
Or how then will it change with us when the breath
Is no more able for such joy and the blood is
Thin in the throat and the time not come for death



Not much of a dog yet,
     that smudge in the distance, beyond the reach
 
of focus. It's just an impressionist
gesture, a guess. 


From the edge of the clearing, the farmhouse
materializes, settles

into wall & stone. The water,
making the surface

of the stream, makes
reflections. So why shouldn't the dog

accept limits, become 

a figure? Is it like the girl who sits
in the hall closet and says she's not
hiding? She's inside—

listening without the burden
of sight, letting locations
release hold. Out of body,
they seem lighter: her parents' voices no longer

hooked to their mouths. They seem
cleaner. Even the electric can opener;
the sounds of children

that rise from the yard, and fall; the opening 
window, these are no longer

effects, things expected
of a subject and verb. The world anyhow is too
straightforward.

Maybe the dog
does not want to be a dog, does not want
to be turned into landscape

but to remain in the beginning, placeless: 

with the wind opening, the wind 
a vowel, and the stars and waters
that flash, recoil, and retch

unnamed as yet, unformed, unfound. 


Some say the evening sunset
is the most amazing sight
some say it is the prelude
to the calming silence of evening's fall
some say it finishes a perfect day
with the most spectacular array of colour
some say it is unforgettable
you are like that sunset
-Unforgettable! 

Some say that the visible stars
on the blanket of twilight
are what make a gorgeous night
some say that even when those stars die
we will see their afterglow
for millions of years to come
some say they know
why they twinkle as an oyster's pearl
some say they are unforgettable
you are like those stars
-Unforgettable! 

Some say that the ocean is a mystery
a wide expanse of endless blue
some say its waves carry away all problems
and swallows them into its deep abyss
some say its power is limitless
and its prominent calm is like an angel's kiss 
it is truly unforgettable
you are like the ocean


-You are unforgettable

in the darkness always lurking
hungry for all control, preying
shadows dance across walls
their presence enclose tightly
long, sharp fingernails grazing
slicing me as they twirl angrily.
crimson bleeds into darkness
staining it with regret and pain
encircling, shadows taunt me
eyes glowing, voices haunting
powerfully overtaking my mind
as the demons gain all control
strong hate burns deep inside
searing pain flows through veins, 
every torturous act they bestow
each cut tearing away more life
hisses saying all i will never be, 
purpose is forcefully ripped away
vivid dreams soon fade, diminish
molded into morbid nightmares
lurking unforgiving demons, wait
hungrily, sharpening their claws
eagerly waiting for the next game


Heart, you are restless as a paper scrap
 That's tossed down dusty pavements by the wind;
 Saying, "She is most wise, patient and kind.
Between the small hands folded in her lap
Surely a shamed head may bow down at length,
 And find forgiveness where the shadows stir
About her lips, and wisdom in her strength,
 Peace in her peace.  Come to her, come to her!"


She will not care.  She'll smile to see me come,
 So that I think all Heaven in flower to fold me.
 She'll give me all I ask, kiss me and hold me,
    And open wide upon that holy air
The gates of peace, and take my tiredness home,


I was only fifteen, 
I still remember her words
that tore through my Heart, 
ostensibly for light years, 
but in truth, for several months.
'I don't love you anymore', 
syllables cutting through my chest
like my dad's straight edge blades.
What did I do? 
What did I say? 
Just tell me, and I'll make things okay.  

Okay? 
Unfortunately, love doesn't work that way at  


Then she echoed the very same words, 
and the razors turned to knives. 
She had no good reason, 
she'd just found someone else, 
and had my Heart not been beating
in my throat which dealt me silent, 
I might have listened to my Mind
logically telling me, I wouldn't want -
someone so unblond, shallow,  and fickle; 
but like I said, and will never forget, 
unfortunately, love doesn't work that way at  
Especially, when you own the part 
of the ''dumpee'', rather than the dumper.
And, in an effort to find that silver lining
that I feared would be of lightening, 
I thought it was good that I had learned
all the socratic philosophies in Life, 
about forever eternal love
and, at such an young age(hmmm) 
that would surely give me a man's leg up(hmmm, hmmm)  
on my very next date that I swore I'd never go for.
Unfortunately, love doesn't work that way at  
ad no recollection to this day, as to how I made
the two mile walk from her house back to mine.
My life had just been shaken up
like  a Hallmark snow globe.
or when I missed the foul shot
that would have sent our school
to the State Hoop finals.


I thought I'd experience hurt en maximus.
I had no clue at the time
that a girl could trump a championship trophy; 
and then of course there were my friends
that always meant well, in taking blood-sweat turns
to cheer me up with jabberwocky lines 
like the my Dad would say killed Vaudville.
Lines like, 'You'll be ''up again'' in no time'', and, 
'dares plenny o'fish n' da' sea''(My pal from Brooklyn) .
Unfortunately, love doesn't work that way at  
(Especially in Brooklyn)   

Well, it took a while; as she lived tnot far from me, 
and when I'd see her alone, I would smile, say hello, 
kept walking, never looking back(some of the the time) .
And for months when I'd see her walking downtown
with her boyfriend, hand in. .. 

AH, hands everywhere, 
It gave some unexpected knowledge, 
of the medical field, if you know what I mean.

Ungraciously, under 
a great soldier's empty helmet, 
a cricket sings


At dawn shey departed
My mind tried to console me -
' Everything is Maya'.
Angrily I replied:
'Here's this sewing box on the table,
that flower-pot on the terrace,
this monogrammed hand-fan on the bed- -
all these are real.'

My mind said: 'Yet, think again.'
I rejoined: ' You better stop.
Look at this storybook,
the hairpin halfway amongst its leaves,
signaling the rest is unread; 
if all these things are 'Maya',
then why should 'shey' be more unreal? '


My mind becomes silent.
A friend arrived and says:
'That which is good is real
it is never non-existent; 
entire world preserves and cherishes it its chest
like a precious jewel in a necklace.'


I replied in anger: 'How do you know? 
Is a body not good? Where did that body go? '

Like a small boy in a rage hitting his mother,
I began to strike at everything in this world
that gave me shelter.
And I screamed:' The world is treacherous.'

Suddenly, I was startled.
It seemed like someone admonished me

I looked at the crescent moon
hidden behind the tamarisk tree outside my window.
As if the dear departed one is smiling
and playing hide-and-seek with me.

From the depth of darkness punctuated by scattered stars
and yet when I remain concealed,
why do you hold on to your faith in me with such conviction? 




WIDE open and unguarded stand our gates,
Named of the four winds, North, South, East, and West;
Portals that lead to an enchanted land
Of cities, forests, fields of living gold,
Vast prairies, lordly summits touched with snow, 
Majestic rivers sweeping proudly past
The Arab’s date-palm and the Norseman’s pine—
A realm wherein are fruits of every zone,
Airs of all climes, for, lo! throughout the year
The red rose blossoms somewhere—a rich land, 
A later Eden planted in the wilds,
With not an inch of earth within its bound
But if a slave’s foot press it sets him free.
Here, it is written, Toil shall have its wage,
And Honor honor, and the humblest man 
Stand level with the highest in the law.
Of such a land have men in dungeons dreamed,
And with the vision brightening in their eyes
Gone smiling to the fagot and the sword.

Wide open and unguarded stand our gates, 
And through them presses a wild motley throng—
Men from the Volga and the Tartar steppes,
Featureless figures of the Hoang-Ho,
Malayan, Scythian, Teuton, Kelt, and Slav,
Flying the Old World’s poverty and scorn; 
These bringing with them unknown gods and rites,—
Those, tiger passions, here to stretch their claws.
In street and alley what strange tongues are loud,
Accents of menace alien to our air,
Voices that once the Tower of Babel knew! 

To leave the gates unguarded? On thy breast
Fold Sorrow’s children, soothe the hurts of fate,
Lift the down-trodden, but with hand of steel
Stay those who to thy sacred portals come 
To waste the gifts of freedom. Have a care
Lest from thy brow the clustered stars be torn
And trampled in the dust. For so of old
The thronging Goth and Vandal trampled Rome,
And where the temples of the Caesars stood 
The lean wolf unmolested made her lair. 

Unguarded word, befriended bird. 
Weighted fell by thrice or third. 
Dusty grind, millers churn. 
Pummel ears, murmurs burn. 

Mongered word off china town, 
bamboos morph to fretting frown. 
Snared enmeshed, wasted sage, 
bowl of death at generous age. 

Placid morns to sullied days, 
rancid slicks on sandy bays. 
Bubbly sprays dash and bounce, 
buffet sighs in crs trounce. 

Tongues to airs, wings have lent. 
Hath words to many, a gallows sent. 
Deadened eyes to rainbows womb, 
spured fear to tear to life entomb. 

Strongest will and hardy soul. 
Char and writhe on carmine coal. 
Words said, unsaid, worlds apart. 
Volley's sent, will raze ramparts


(Aug A scent of ripeness from over a wall. 
And come to leave the routine road
And look for what had made me stall, 
There sure enough was an apple tree
That had eased itself of its summer load, 
And of all but its trivial foliage free, 
Now breathed as light as a lady's fan. 
For there had been an apple fall
As complete as the apple had given man. 
The ground was one circle of solid red. 

May something go always unharvested! 
May much stay out of our stated plan, 
Apples or something forgotten and left, 
So smelling their sweetness would be no theft. 

The lament shall go 
Unheard
Did the rose ever shed a tear
It withers into petals 
On its own

The wave of the stem was the wind
Spring has come
Asking for leave now

Nightingale has the plaint
Why sing it not 
Unless from a broken heart

Islamabad
Three boys down by the river
search for crawdads. One has
hammered a spear from a 
curtain rod, and head down,
jeans rolled up to his knees, wades
against the river's current.
Barely seven, he's the most
determined. He'll go home
hours from now with nothing
to show for his efforts except
dirt and sweat and that residue
he's unaware of sifting
down from a distant sky
and glinting like threads
of mica across his shoulders.
In the distance someone keeps
calling the names of the brothers
in the same order over 
and over, but they don't hear
what with the river bank gorged
with blue weed patches and all
the birds in hiding. Perhaps no
one is calling and it's only 
the voices of the air as
the late light of June hangs on 
in the cottonwoods before
the dark gets the last word. 

look around, and what do you see
children of all races and creeds
white, yellow, black, olive complexioned too.
don't you realize that they all need you? 

look at pictures and read the news
children all over the world
starving and without parents and love.

must they pay for the elders mistakes
must they be the victims of our ignorance.
  let us give them what we had as kids.

love, food, affection is all they ask.
look at their faces and think
of your own children and if they would
survive, if they were in their places.

no matter what our beliefs.
so let us all do our part.

let us help and love one another
let us all become sister and brother.
don't let our little sisters and brothers starve
open up your minds and your hearts.

give a part of yourself that you 
have yet to give
and let these poor children live. 

Come again, come again
Outside my window
As dome-shaped saucers
Shining an ethereal light

And, as I rush outside
In curiosity, play hide and seek
Fly over the trees
Vanish into the sky
In the starry expanse 
Which the Milky Way girdles

UFOs! Ever remain unidentified
So that poetry we can weave
Yarns of mystery around you
Move about like somnambulists
Eyes raised and riveted in the skies
Anxious to capture your unpredictable flights

Sorry, some of us have been prosaic
Linked you to our nuclear sites
Made movies of aliens who maul and kill
Scamper like big roaches
Walk like encephalitis
Men in black
Conspiring with Heads of States
Dissect abductees
Like we do with mice

Humanity, it seems, is all set
For a paradigm shift
To assimilate a gruesome probability
In through the fringes of expanding reality

The mightiest State on the globe
Is dying to be abducted into it
The rest of the world then has no choice
Star wars, death, destruction and pain
A sad repeat of past history
On extra-terrestrial scale.
If that is the shape of human wont

UFOs! Please, therefore, ever remain
Unidentified stuff, for our fancy
To weave stories and mysteries
In boundless poesy
May we remain ever bound
To terrestrial territory
And may our eyes alone wander
The endless blue, and starry nights
For your desultory darts from eternity

Peace, Peace, Peace. 

Come again, come again

Peace, Peace, Peace. 

I’m flying in the light
I swallow my pain and fear, 
As I hear angels and devils fight
I can shed only a single tear.
Entrancing ghosts circle the air, 
The feeling of terror is waning, 
The virginal silence starts to tear, 
The one tear I shed, is staining.
Words in the air, the quiet is going.
Colorful vapors hover over the path.
Sticky life, hangs on to the crying spirits.
And hear his cherubs haunting lyrics.
Strangely, it’s peaceful behind the light.
I must now bow down and kiss her feet.
I can only help myself in heavens plight.
Red bugs ooze from crystalline water.
I stomp on them with my shoes.
She gazes, knowing no one can stop her.
For me, this is surely not good news.
An angel’s child I am to bear.
Awaken! The birthing is hard.
This one child I cannot love, I swear.
From now on, I cannot fault my guard.
Deaths life is unafraid, 
But I know that his love for me is hesitant.
This life of death I have made, 
But my lover’s fury is notoriously unpleasant.
My chance to flee across the river Styx, 
It finally arrives, just on time.
A bribe to the rower is my quick fix.
I tell my beautiful evil child everything is fine.
But then I can throw her off the boat, 
And tell her that her next life will be better.
I know it’s over when her curls cease to float.
My last words to her, were that of my last only love, 
He had better start working hard up above.
I have relinquished his holey wingspan.
But now with who can I seek my final shelter.
For a price of passion I can take a final board.
This mans love is enough to make life swelter.
But I know I can end it all again, with this rope and cord. 


once upon a time i saw a girl; 
and in first look i impress on her; 
here eyes, here face is unique in compare
to other; 
but when i go near to her she is no one 
but she was Cinderella.

once upon a time; 
in a land so far; 
a girl kiss the fog; 
but when i go near to her
i saw the Cinderella.

once upon a time; 
in a dark so far; 
i having seen one girl; 
who goes into darkness and 
spread lightness on us; 
but when that girl pass from myside
i saw Cinderella in that girl. 

In poetry, you render from the gut -
Expository slut, the aim: 
Cathartic legs apart, 
Inviting all to penetrate
Your world; 
A whore of individuality -
Your literary art ejaculating
From the riven heart -
Pumping, thumping, crying out
Upon the sleeve - 
For that is what you do -
Uniquely -
Now believe.



I wish I could prove that hatred is wrong and we must survive tomorrow

I cannot see how bare hands can hurt, can fight and can kill
What we are seeing is so, so wrong. Yet sadly this is real

I'd like to believe that the future holds a way to end this madness
Is this real? Is it a dream for it brings such sadness

We must bond, we must see that there is a thorn in every rose
Aches and pains are hard enough without what the headlines have shown

I want to wake and see the news, saying; No More War! 
For too many lives have been lost
Nothing gained, who can explain, What has this been for

So can we not join, We are all born with One warm heart
We all can feel we all can love. We are all given a life long start

So let the whole world see that weapons are so wrong
We must seek peace, Destroy all weapons. We all must get along

He wants us to belong
You, Me bring peace, Let the world be free
We can Unite As One

'Speaking words of wisdom'  Let Us Be!

Why cant this killing end? 


September As coin have two sides
We always find
Dark and light
With wrong and right 

How can they be distinguished? 
If one is not wrongly finished  
It is for us to compare
And take care

Dark is good
And needed as food
Life can turn any time gloomy 
We should know the aspect of tragedy

Who will want to remain poor? 
And not seek power 
To know power and strength
It is necessary to have deep breathe 

Never be afraid of any side
As it will first divide
Then unite with efforts 
And help to sort


Why do we have to Kill? 
When can we come together, 
And Heal our wound? 
Forgive one another, 

And come together to Help each other? 
Save all of this world's people, 
Come together in Unison.
United for Freedom! 

We can be there for each other, 
To wipe the Tears away, 
To show Strength in hardships we may face, 
To Think in on Body and in one Mind.

To be Peaceful and Respectful to All of this place, 
Have a United World, 
That shows Mercy and Grace, 
And comes together in times of need.

Give Ourselves for Other's needs.
We all must need Hope to Succeed, 
Hand in hand, 
And heart to heart.

We see each other for who we truly are, 
United a World of Unity; 
We have Hope.
We will be Free.

Let us live in unity and equality. 

Space is ample, east and west,
But two cannot go abreast,
Cannot travel in it two:
Yonder masterful cuckoo
Crowds every egg out of the nest,
Quick or dead, except its own;
A spell is laid on sod and stone,
Night and day were tampered with,
Every quality and pith
Surcharged and sultry with a power
That works its will on age and hour. 

There is something dense, united, settled in the depths,
repeating its number, its identical sign.
How it is noted that stones have touched time,
in their refined matter there is an odor of age,
of water brought by the sea, from salt and sleep.
 
I'm encircled by a single thing, a single movement: 
a mineral weight, a honeyed light
cling to the sound of the word "noche":
the tint of wheat, of ivory, of tears,
things of leather, of wood, of wool,
archaic, faded, uniform,
collect around me like walls.

I work quietly, wheeling over myself,
a crow over death, a crow in mourning.
I mediate, isolated in the spread of seasons,
centric, encircled by a silent geometry:
a partial temperature drifts down from the sky,
a distant empire of confused unities
reunites encircling me. 

Unified in Diversity. 
That's what people today should be.
Humans embracing harmony and happiness.
Hope that flowers from the seed, 
That will allow us all to prosper.

Why does colour or race matter? 
Why not join together, instead of being scrambled and scattered? 
Why can't we just not plainly see, 
The unity in diversity? 

People will be people all the same, 
And under the setting sun, 
Nothing may ever change, 

But I am here to take a stand, 
To show the world how to finally be, 


Unified in Diversity. 


From experience what we try to achieve? 
Do we try to impose or leave it to believe? 
From European past, it has emerged differently
From Middle East it has tested bitterly 

The religion has not kept them together 
Geographically they stay apart and differ 
Their political ideology is entirely indifferent
One is always trying to over impose at present 


If religion was the main criteria, the Islam should have asserted
So far nothing has gone in their way
The history was different in past and is same as of today 


One thing we have understood properly
No religion can make us to live orderly 
As it is personal belief and trust
The interference should be least

Middle East is witnessing more bloodshed
With religion feeling as predominant, it has failed
To keep many parts united and preserve identity
But alas! We find same ideology but with diversity 

We find forceful conversion from different faith
Why do they should do when their own faith fails to defy death? 
They are majority people so far religious professing is concerned  
Can they not teach universal brotherhood and situation be turned

Change brings new fervor
Fragrance with honor
Wish for doing something new
This is fact realized by few

Nature too supports 
Time and again it reports
With alarm and indication
There is time to change equation

The earth has been torn apart
There have been cracks on some parts
It has no more tolerance
The rain must lash out at once

The monsoon may strike soon with force 
To alleviate the suffering with its source
The rainwater may bring first respite
All over there is happiness to cite

The new life thrives on to witness
The spring knocks with colorful face
The flowers are there to open petals
Very good sign of live signal 

It all ends up again with autumn
No one can condemn
It is universal change
We got to adapt and manage


Around the hub, the galaxies turn
Pinwheels scrubbed, in magnetic urn
Gravity attracts, while motion glides
Equal force acts, to sustain the rides

The Milky Way, is towed along
Its center conveyed, by nature's song
The flux lines strum, as they pass by
A radio hum, an electrical sigh

And so it be, with our own sun
By magnetic sea, its field is spun
The axial spin, then thus does tow
It's satellites in an induction row

The best conductors turn fairly fast
While the resistors last with the past
Lines of force roll round the outside
Because the course is too dense inside

When the field of the planet is low
It tends to yield all turning flow

Mrs. Ground; Mr. Sun
Someday I'll be grass
and your feet will pass
in confident, youthful strides
I'll be 'dead' 
And you'll be 'alive'
and with pride you may live
may live as i once did-
A Giver; A Taker; 
Destroyer; Maker. 
A pile of dust
that dreamed one night
that it was Flesh and Bone
-Alive and Alone. 

Children gather
invite the rain, they cuddle.
Frolic in silt, scream-less.
Joy is a tattler.
Rubor of fun wanes
in the dust of brown dwarf.
Healing in mud poops
castings and wrinkle slicks, 
A cure for earth. 

There the randomness senses
Withdrawal of an unknown tact
Momentum was there in each turn
To the heights of an artistic part

Pensiveness grooms in senses
Holistic part looms and whispers
Breeze that tingle in heart with sigh
Abundance that wrestle and lapses

Sense the clout with a part of life
Unknown shores mark its part
Union of all lovely fancies
Hidden part contradicts itself

Visual was empty all these time
But the whistle narrate its chart
Feel that pamper inner sighs
Holiness that rejuvenate its part

Vagueness may be in next track
Some hands is rating that way silently
Blindness never unwrap its facts
As it beyond senses of human! ! ! ! ! ! 

And when they see her pass
The poets' ladies
Look no more in the glass
But after her.

On a bleak moor
Running under the moon
She lures a poet,
Once proud or happy, soon
Far from his door.

Beside a train,
Because they saw her go,
Or failed to see her,
Travellers and watchers know
Another pain.

The simple lack
Of her is more to me
Than others' presence,
Whether life splendid be
Or utter black.

I have not seen,
I have no news of her;
I can tell only
She is not here, but there
She might have been.

She is to be kissed
Only perhaps by me;
She may be seeking
Me and no other; she
May not exist. 

I use the colors to recompose your image
While enclosing to open the space alternatively
With relevance and traceability
I'm like a painter seeking her own color, 
Or like a singer seeking her own voice, 
Or like a philosopher seeking her own self. 
Neither like, nor unlike a painting, is this color 
A new dream between ultraviolet and infrared? 
Neither like, nor unlike a song, is this color 
A pulse of an upbeat dance groove? 
Neither like, nor unlike a philosophical idea, is this color 
A fusion of the individualities between 
I see you in that color.
‘Tis like you place yourself directly in front of my sight, 
And there is only me to see you.
You sit there, in the color without any name.
You're my eternity.
I defeat my dream as I defeat an illusion, 
And I receive the reality of light. 
I close my eyes, and I feel its warmth.
I feel a shiver running up my spine, 
And I feel the healing rays enlightening my spirit.
It's so peaceful and overgrown with trees
Like seeing a beautiful picture of the woman 
And the nature being in harmony. 

Smiles under the tree, unknown
Dead-body sleeps


I boarded the flight
Uncertain of my destination
Uncertain of my safety 
The zeal for what lay ahead proved important than me
Saving a life was not an option for me

Was i selfish to my family? 
Was i selfish to myself? 
Was i selfish to my love? 
I had a greater mission ahead.
Saving a life was not an option for me

They spoke not my language, I spoke not their language
We spoke the language of humanity-this, we understood best 
They profiled me, i profiled them 
We profiled each other, the cement of trust was cast 
Saving a life was not an option for me

I asked for a peek into their plight
They opened their wounded hearts
They opened their close to empty houses
They exposed their vulnerability-

without an iota of shame
Saving a life was not an option for me

Empathetic i was
Confidentiality i promised
We both ached -I found a home far from home
I called it a program, i called it a project
Saving a life was not an option for me


Why does twilight
Instill in me
A sadness? 
Why does a lonely star
Make me go lachrymose? 

Am not separated from a beloved
To empathize with a tearful moon
At age sixty nine
Yet, what is it that tears at my heart
An ache, is that existential? 

Yet, an unknown pain
Is that we carry
From birth till death
Like unwilling pall bearers

If that weren’t the case
Of what avail is fancy
Depth of the night sky
Chirp of the lone sparrow
At nightfall
On the mountainside
Of what avail is poetry
At a pedestrian countryside? 

Beautiful is pain
Am no masochist
Pain has poesy
As do sunsets
And the smiling Sirius
On a winter eve

Pain, pain and pain
Men tried to sink it in drinks
Here I remain
Eternally intoxicated
To weave the yarns
Of ceaseless poesy
Words please gather 
Around my aching pen
So the pain of an unknown sunset
I can immortalize

To the memory of all who have fallen in war.
At the going down of the sun, 
And in the morning -we will remember them

UNKNOWN SOLDIER

"Where have all the soldiers gone, "
"Gone to graveyards everyone; "
Peter Seeger’s sung melodies.  
A grieving mother’s sad memories.
Our mother’s sons gone to war, 
Repeated untold times before, 
Gone to fight for kith and kin, 
Each mother’s heart broken within.
Waiting for that ‘gram’ to arrive, 
Your son is not coming home alive; 
'Your son is missing presumed dead', 
That is how those telegrams read.
Now buried deep, so far from home
Beneath some foreign turf and loam.
A Bayoneted rifle marks the hamlet, 
Atop the butt, a mangled helmet, 
No ‘dog tags’, neck laced identity, 
An unmarked grave- for eternity.

Where is the sanity of it all, 
Where is the sense of it all, 
"When will we ever learn, 
When- will we ever learn."


Mad waves crash with vengeance against the harbour walls, 
Thrashing, lashing, driven onwards by fearsome squalls.
Frail boats glimpsed at anchor, tethered out on the sea, 
Pitching and tossing savagely, close to the quay.
Their sails sorely battered by the constant wind and rain, 
Each of them held firmly by a strong iron chain.
Fastened so securely to the deep ocean bed, 
Until the violent mighty raging storm has fled.

Natures unleashed forces will go to any lengths, 
Striking with powerful and unabated strengths, 
Out of control they start to forge their way ahead, 
Propelled with robust vigour causing fear and dread.
Leaving devastation behind them in their wake, 
Giving such great heartache, when viewed at quiet daybreak.

Mad waves crash with vengeance against the harbour walls, 
Making their own landfalls.


The fire and I smoke
Unless the reed 
And the harp
Unless the sunset
Unless I pick the salt
From high tide
On your coast
Unless from my hands the dust
Unless the moon that shines on you
I raise my hands to and unless
They take me in chains

Islamabad
gnawing through a shinbone, a high howl
inside of which a bloody, slashed-by-growls note
is heard, unlike that
sound, and instead, its opposite: a barely sounded
sound (put your nuclear ears
on for it, your giant hearing horn, its cornucopia mouth
wide) -- a slippery whoosh of rain
sliding down a mirror
leaned against a windfallen tree stump, the sound
a child's head makes
falling against his mother's breast,
or the sound, from a mile away, as the town undertaker
lets Grammy's wrist
slip from his grip
and fall to the shiny table. And, if you turn
your head just right
and open all your ears,
you might hear
this finest sound, this lost sound: a plow's silvery prow
cleaving the earth (your finger
dragging through milk, a razor
cutting silk) like a clipper ship cuts the sea.
If you do hear this sound,
then follow it with your ear and also your eye
as it and the tractor that pulls it
disappear over a hill
until it is no sound at all,
until it comes back over the hill again,
again dragging its furrow,
its ground-rhythm, its wide open throat, behind it. 

From single thread to a garment
From a flower to a bouquet
From a blade of grass to a lawn
From a grain of sand to a beach
From a rain drop to a river
From a pebble to a mountain 
From single stone to a mansion
From a leaf to a forest great
From butterfly to an eagle
From a breadth to a hurricane
From gold dust to a great gold mine
From single candle to the sun
From a star to a milky way
Now till forever-I love you

Unluckily for a death
Waiting with phoenix under
The pyre yet to be lighted of my sins and days,
And for the woman in shades
Saint carved and sensual among the scudding
Dead and gone, dedicate forever to my self
Though the brawl of the kiss has not occurred
On the clay cold mouth, on the fire
Branded forehead, that could bind
Her constant, nor the winds of love broken wide
To the wind the choir and cloister
Of the wintry nunnery of the order of lust
Beneath my life, that sighs for the seducer's coming
In the sun strokes of summer,

Loving on this sea banged guilt
My holy lucky body
Under the cloud against love is caught and held and kissed
In the mill of the midst
Of the descending day, the dark our folly,
Cut to the still star in the order of the quick
But blessed by such heroic hosts in your every
Inch and glance that the wound
Is certain god, and the ceremony of souls
Is celebrated there, and communion between suns.
Never shall my self chant
About the saint in shades while the endless breviary
Turns of your prayed flesh, nor shall I shoo the bird below me:
The death biding two lie lonely.

I see the tigron in tears
In the androgynous dark,
His striped and noon maned tribe striding to holocaust,
The she mules bear their minotaurs,
The duck-billed platypus broody in a milk of birds.
I see the wanting nun saint carved in a garb
Of shades, symbol of desire beyond my hours
And guilts, great crotch and giant
Continence. I see the unfired phoenix, herald
And heaven crier, arrow now of aspiring
And the renouncing of islands.
All love but for the full assemblage in flower
Of the living flesh is monstrous or immortal,
And the grave its daughters.

Love, my fate got luckily,
Teaches with no telling
That the phoenix' bid for heaven and the desire after
Death in the carved nunnery
Both shall fail if I bow not to your blessing
Nor walk in the cool of your mortal garden
This I know from the native
Tongue of your translating eyes. The young stars told me,
Lucklessly she must lie patient
And the vaulting bird be still. O my true love, hold me.
In your every inch and glance is the globe of genesis spun,
And the living earth your sons. 

It is time to give that-of-myself which I could not at first:
To offer you now at last my least and my worst:
Minor, absurd preserves,
The shell's end-curves,
A document kept at the back of a drawer,
A tin hidden under the floor,
Recalcitrant prides and hesitations:
To pile them carefully in a desparate oblation
And say to you "quickly! turn them
Once over and burn them".

Now I (no communist, heaven knows!
Who have kept as my dearest right to close
My tenth door after I've opened nine to the world,
To unfold nine sepals holding one hard-furled)
Shall - or shall try to - offer to you
A communism of two . 

See, entry's yours;
Here, the last door!




By the flickering  candlelight
of the long evenings, 
inimical to study so they said

they played this game
to while away the time
between learning and authority

in that Jesuit college
in the early : 

blindfolded or simply shut-eye and don’t cheat
you turn the pages of the Latin dictionary at random
and stick a pin, in turn, upon a random word; 

the first to make a sentence
in the fewest rounds, the fewest words, wins
a prize of choice..

we do not know the prize
(among those severe, repressed, ambitious
boys, perhaps it’s just as well-) 
or what the others drew; 

but this we know: that night
Rene pricked a first word – ‘sum’ – ah! -
promising! a verb was useful, in this game—

the second round- he pricked on ‘ergo’-
that swift mind already playing the tables
of his agile mind-

the air was tense; they’d remember
this night, this flickering light, 
forever in their future lives-

a hush (how boys fight to win
whom they would become-) 

‘Cogito’! A shout of triumph
from our Rene – and the rest
is history – alas..

It’s said the Devil enters in
at the third stroke; and so it was: 

in three words, a lifetime’s career
as the greatest of divines
in an age of  awe for the divine

were lost to mere – philosophy-
the age of Clairvaux, Cluny, Chartres
for all too brief a moment, 
saw the vision of a glorious revival; but. 

triumphantly, our Rene shouts


alas for human vanity! The gods were whispering
‘Sum, ergo cogito! ’ in his spiritual ear – but no –
his chose mankind’s so vain conceit

and launched a thousand thousand
cafe tables on the pavement; seated there
in black, with scarf and beret, sunglasses, 

in a cloud of choking  gitane and gauloise smoke, 
centuries of self-satisfied philosophes, 
believing 'cogito, ergo sum': that they are  their thought; born
as true Frenchmen, to be world thinkers, Rodin-like; and
that because they think, they are- somebody-

oh Rene, what a fall was there.  

A letter came a week ago.
It's mutely resting between
the potted ivy and car keys
marking time on the table
in the foyer.

It's unopened, of course, 
but I know what it says -
I just can't make myself
read the words.

I know they're angry.
I know they're designed to ask
in yet one more way
for what I don't have to give.

I've walked by it
a thousand times, 
even held it a few.


Maybe if left unread
the words will somehow change
and say what I need most to hear. 

I left my originality at the office today
After one of those long bored meetings.


Or was it in traffic on my way
Pondering why I traded my Harley for a Mercedes? 

Maybe it was at the grocery in the fray
Completing the seemingly endless list you gave me. 


Could be at the bar with my friend Jay
Too many jokes over a Martini? 

It’s possible I never had any to begin with, anyway, 
originality or creativity, I mean.


So forgive me if I’m lame as lame can be
Clueless, Hopeless
Not knowing the proper address.
Uninspired basically, 
When I just tell you plainly: 
‘I love you, Baby! ’Pretty sure a female neighbor
was kidding when she recently 
told me: 'After giving birth
to six nearly consecutive children
I finally decided to truly childproof 
my home, Last night, I threw
'Twas but just now my bleak leaves hopeless hung 
Sullied with dust and mud; 
Each snarling blast shot through me, and did share 
Their youth, and beauty, cold showers nipt, and wrung 
Their spiciness and blood; 
But since thou didst in one sweet glance survey 
Their sad decays, I flourish, and once more 
Breath all perfumes, and spice; 
I smell a dew like myrrh, and all the day 
Wear in my bosom a full sun; such store 
Hath one beam from thy eyes. 
What one poor leaf did ever I yet fall 
To wait upon thy wreath? 
Thus thou all day a thankless weed dost dress, 
And when th'hast done, a stench or fog is all 
The odor I bequeath. 






So there he sits on the wheelchair, 
hissing and blowing, fighting over that heavy birthday flame, 
eyes tightly shut, 
gums chewing toothlessly on that last 
wish-
-that he promptly walks his rotten stick backwards, 
leading the two gradually de-wrinkled legs

to fit in his long forgotten skis, 
to slide the slope backwards, 
little skin cancers repressed under the de-lit sun
walking de-swollen feet

to fit in his marathon racers recollecting rubber from the asphalt, 
a whole forty-two years
and a hundred and ninety-two days 
rewinding on the first-video-recorder-of-all-times’ tape

to fit in his rollerblades, 
to roll back to where his pink fingers would grip on any adult pointer
to balance over an open, bloody, pumping hole, 
to take his wasted cry back, 
to reattach to his umbilical cord.


Reconnected, he opens one eye, 
to tell her how he has changed, indeed
and then the other to focus-
-now ready to pop off
-just like that candle-
incognito.



that little girl's inquisitivenes.    came alive after four decades.         she developed aversion to physical love, distrusting all when the right time arrive. years of beibg subjected to pang after pang,  which destroyed all forms of yearning.  she spent her life in shame concealing,  she blamed herself for not telling. what exactly drew them to her? what did they see when they hover? tender age or not she was also at fault,  quietly giving service of a sort. she rememberes them all one by one, turning her into a plaything of their own. is this the same hole which they call sacred? why was it then so much desecrated?  who was the one that started?  how did the others followed? where were the parents, neighbours, playmates?  do all little girls go through these ordeals?  defilers came and went as they please.  always keeping separate times.  they did things to her for years without remorse,  watchful passive little girl laid there motionless.  she knew it was inappropriate,  she didn't tell she bore it. internalized her feelings wondering for years, adults are capable of doing hurtful things. was she scared to confide in her mommy? powerless woman would have given her away, to his highness who ruled the day, who worked in factories cities overseas,  who only understood machines,  he beats up his kids to discipline,  that was his way of being stern. he was feared by family looked down by others,  for his overprotectiveness, little girl rejected domesticity,  she resented society.  they taught her badness inwardly,  preached goodness outwardly.  her mood swings affected siblings,  quarelled with friends and classmates,  no one investigated cause of her distress,  gone was all forms of belief,  little girl has fallen the cliff. she stopped going to their know-it-all house. 


she pulled herself from the douse. 

Love is unread book
But have kind look
Around the trees 
To feel its shed cool and free
 
You can see birds
With melody to be heard
Love may be felt
Fragrance may be smelt

Flowers may be around
With different colors to be found
Not a single color may displease
Eyes may be cooled at ease 

You can feel gentle touch 
The power is felt as such
No one can deny its existence
It has its unique presence 

Love not to forget
Allow them to blossom and let
Each one has fine quality
Just look at them with serenity 

Even birds had wanted in winter
In their own way and sphere 
Where is the time to fear? 
When love sings in their ears

I shall sing and wait
To see the difference and get
Know exactly what can be its real value! 
Then come to conclusion for its review


The night, the tears rolled down my cheek. 
Did you even know? 
How lost and sick inside I was! 
If you did, you didn't show it. 

The night, my world came crashing down! 
The night, that turned my life around! 
Did you even care? 
Were you ever there? 

Why do I hold things from you? 
I just don't know, but I still love you. 
You both love me too


I just ask myself why..
Why did you never see, 
The pain and misery locked up inside of me? 
You cannot hear what I may say, day after day. 
But I want to say



you lost, 
and becoming last of the last, 
and future is a weather forcast, 
the paradise is distant, 
dream, walking empty hands, 
a sketch made on the sands, 
When we see by closing eyes, 
Our vision dies, 
Placing universe on temporal measure, 
one page of life we tear, 
better to do, 
what you want, 
and leave what you dont want


Unrealistic world

I feel lull
And dull
So made call
Before real fall

I fall on ground
With no dreams to be found
My dreams go along
But I am proved wrong

Is this true feeling? 
Where I am dealing
With realistic world
And finally exit door is closed

So it is desirable
For all people
To be firm and remain on ground
And think so sound

Sometimes unrealistic world gives pleasure
For your role as entertainer
You are given rousing welcome
You stand with open arms and finally come


Effortless going efforts
Unmesh the web
Caught was a cruiser 
Salmon 
For the catcher


Made and remade every spot
The resolve 
In the smiling eyes of unknown man

Played displayed innocence
The noose
String he holds

Break unbreak rules
Cry out without context
Speak modern
Contrive

Love
And other putrid things
Hospitality

By the lamp post
One man walks with ten guards

Unresolve
Please understand



All day upon the garden bright
The suns shines strong,
But in my heart there is no light,
Or any song.

Voices of merry life go by,
Adown the street;
But I am weary of the cry
And drift of feet.


With all dear things that ought to please
The hours are blessed,
And yet my soul is ill at ease,
And cannot rest.

Strange spirit, leave me not too long,
Nor stint to give,
For if my soul have no sweet song,
It cannot live.

See to act
But never react
To the criticism
Offered by them


We are human
And prone to temptation
We are influenced by greed
And call it as paramount need 

If I dislike
That will never strike
In my mind to act contrary
I shall then be prepared to carry 

I shall silently choose
Between unrest and peace
I will go on working
Without taking notice 

Less you involve
And comfortably you solve
Any irritant 
That lies ahead at present


So much of what we live goes on inside–
The diaries of grief, the tongue-tied aches
Of unacknowledged love are no less real
For having passed unsaid. What we conceal
Is always more than what we dare confide.
Think of the letters that we write our dead.


Unsaid condition

I could speak nothing
Except to look at and smiling
You were deep inside
So it was not difficult to decide

We waited for final word
And blessings from lord
It was to be firm decision
With precision

I could see through eyes
When tried
To find an answer
It was becoming now clear

We had one desire
To be near and dear
The heart was missing beats
But we went for only to greet 

Life shall smile again
With our guns trained 
On holy and sacred relation
That was only unsaid condition


inching my way up a hill
truck stop to give ride
she does it often; kind
i lift myself at the back
she knows where am going at
drop off curve beneath light

i wave my hand; happy heart
my stove is waiting for me
still have few blocks of wood
water i catch from rain; enough
my tv is broke, my roof leaks
nobody knows i live like these


Going too far
The thought in spirit
For the heightened experience
From the one hemisphere
To another
With faith
With indifference
And short of unconsciousness
Leaving behind the reason
And the guilt of being born
Unself-consciousness
Like the weird dress
On the big day
Like smashing the golden frame
To feel the texture of a Rembrandt
Like the one who treaded the moon
Like the one who aims at the stars
Like the great master of verse
Like Shams of Tabrez
Like the beloved Dara
Like Sarmad
Like Mansoor al Hallaj
Like Majnun
They held a great prayer-service in Berlin,
And augured German triumph from some words
To Gideon, which signified that He
Was staunchly partial to the Israelites.
The aisles were thronged; and in the royal box
(I had it from a tourist who was there,
Clutching her passport, anxious, like the rest),
There sat the Kaiser, looking 'very sad.'
And then they sang; she said it shook the heart.
The women sobbed; tears salted bearded lips
Unheeded; and my friend looked back and saw
A young girl crumple in her mother's arms.




There was a young man, a good while ago,
Who taught that doctrine.  but they murdered him
With other folk.
They are long-lived, these fierce
There surely will be spilled enough of blood
To drown them all! The deeps of sea and air,
Of old the seat of gods, no more are safe,
For mines and monoplanes. The Germans, now,
With Zeppelins, or some slim mother's son
Of Paris, or of Tours, or Brittany,
Can drop a bomb into the Feste Burg,
And, having crushed the source of German strength,
Die happy in his blazing monoplane.


Save in the heart of man, why, even so --
Oh, let us make Him large enough for all,
Or cease to prate of Him! If kings must fight,
Let them fight for their glory, openly,
And plain men for their lands and for their homes,
And heady youths, who go to see the fun,
Who cannot go, who can but wait and mourn,
Except that she will teach Him to her sons --
And much concerned to keep Alsace-Lorraine.
They should go godless, too -- the poor, benumbed
Crushed, anguished women, till their hearts can hold
A greater Comforter!


(Yet it is hard
To make Him big enough! For me, I like
The English and the Germans and the French,
The Russians, too; and Servians, I should think,
And hardly takes a nigger seriously
This side of Africa. Not those, at least
Who steal my wood, and of a summer night
Keep me awake with shouting, where they sit
With monkey-like fidelity and glee
Grinding through their well-oiled sausage-mill --
The dead machinery of the white man's church --
Raw jungle-fervor, mixed with scraps sucked dry
Of Israel's old sublimities: not those.
And when they threaten us, the Higher Race,
Lest blood yet spurt to wash that black skin white,
As now it flows because a German hates
A Cossack, and an Austrian a Serb!)
What was it that he said so long ago,
And there shall fall a million murdered men


Longed for months, drought's day
Is going to get washed away 
Soon enough within a day
As it appears, the vast cloud, grey

Over the mountain, at distance
Emerald carpet, once was
Seem smiling and overjoyed 
Out crying in joy of hopes getting fulfilled

Like viewing through a screen of 
Scorched plant leaves, parched twigs 
Scald turf and skeletonized plants
A peacock dancing tat a tat.  tat-tat-tat

Peasants and village folks
Dancing to the tune of heart beat
To afford a rousing welcome to the fall
Whole world waited for so long


There are things that we do 
for the people that we love; 
Strange things. From the ground
up to the sky above.

There are their secrets which we keep, 
and bring with us to the grave.
There are their words, thoughts and actions, 
that makes us free men and women all act like slaves.


There are their secrets which we keep, 
which in our souls will burn away.
And yet we still stay steadfast
and never let them see the light of day.

They are the people we protect, 
who know naught of this protection.
For we all fear if they knew 
what went beyond mere affection.

They are the people that you love, 
and yet must daily now ignore.
They are the reason that you are fearful, 
to step out and explore.

You have seen them cry, 
and weep before they sleep.
You have tried to walk away, 
but you know you're in far too deep. 


Everyday somewhere in the world 
another unsung hero is born. 
Someone who is willing, 
to lay his life on the line 
to save another living creature, 
on this wonderful planet of ours. 
To go out of their way, 
and risk life and limb to save something, 
from danger and certain death. 
These unsung heroes don’t want medals, 
glory or even fame. 
In fact, most would walk away afterwards, 
without anyone ever knowing their name. 
It is not that they feel guilty. 
They just feel that they haven’t done 
anything that is special 
or something someone else 
wouldn’t have probably done. 
Therefore, to all those unsung heroes 
this poem is just for you. 
For all the lives that you save 
each and every day. 


You were unsung love
Since beginning till date
I found no one with so much of care
You were far but very much here

The birds too reminded me of your presence
The "Cuckoo" was heard by chance
It was your lovely melodious voice
That gave me word of promise

Yes let me tell you
You have soul that is true
Free from asking any undue favor
But asking always some words of honor

You have lifted my spirit
When open greeted 
Which were really concerning downtrodden 

I have openly sided
And secretly confided
That you are my lovely cuckoo
Black bird but very much honest and true 

I shall carry same impression
Till the end witnesses worldly relation
I shall be no more and resting in grave 
Still hear the same and willingly crave

There is a natty kind of mind
That slicks its thoughts,
Culls its oughts,
Trims its views,
Prunes its trues,
And never suspects it is a rind. 


Though I am not the proud stag, 
Looking to my long, branched horns
In a spring of water; 
Though you emit musk of deer, 
And drink butterfly’s milk, 
Though you sleep in incense, 
And a bed of red roses await you.
Your posts hunt me like hounds, 
And like the poor stag on run, 
When my horns are stuck in bushes, 
They overtake me; accepting no apologies.
How then the humble me, 
Ask to be spared the trouble, 
And the long niceties exchanged, 
Hugging friends every hour, 
Greeting them every morning, as if
They are meeting you after ten years.
Will you please untag me, or I will block you, 
My both hands joined together, on my knees, 
In a namaste ritual, asking forgiveness. 

They say that the west is untamed
Maybe it’s true as they say
But where they may think there is no life
There will always be one thing for sure
	A cloud of dust upon the plains
Dark figures race across the land
Running under the noonday sun
Red, black, golden, and brown bodies
Covered with sweat and dust
	Like streaks of color on the dusty plain
Copper, dun, chestnut, and white
All the colors that you could imagine
Always moving on to another place; 
Whether the times are dry or wet.
	Oh, to see the sun shining on backs of 
The running horses are a glorious sight
The life and color that follows them everywhere
Adds life to the endless prairie plains


Until you die
I would cry
tears of happiness
not of sympathy 
you couldn't see
the errors you that you have ignored to fix
beacause of it
I'll be grateful when your gone
I would be happy once more
I'll breathe more easily
I'll laugh without hesitation
I'll talk on and on
but until you die
my world will be isolated


I was just an innocent
Caught in a whirlpool of puerile dreams, 
Every second I spent with you, 
Really was a dream come true.
Around us, was fantasy escalating
Until your daybreak dawned on me.


Love-
Used to be like a dead and inanimate sun, 
You came along, 
Showed me what is love, 
Changed my life innumerable ways, 
Some of which, I cant even spell.

We were meant to be, 
The only ones to ever see, 
What true love really means-
That our future was forseen-
As someone special, 
 to share my heart.

First, it was too good to be true, 
Brought me to life, 
so strong so spiritual, 
It was simply me and you.
But soon we loved 
and too late we knew-
That three, was too much of
 a crowd.


Misery was created, 
Aspertions cast, 
Love disc  thrown so recklessly
It hit so truculently, 
Only to awaken, 
That love cannot be compelled.

Our trust was strained, 
With our last hope drained, 
Evolved into hate
And had only fate to blame.

We hurt each other too much, 
Gambled our love, 
On the table of mess., 
Between the truth and the lies, 
We pretend that guilt will mend, 
Wats the point of it now? 
 Then, 
realizing truth hurts, 
We part as best friends, 
Love glasses silently break
Knowing this is the end.

Wounds,  too deep to heal, 
Time, is the best healer they say.
Now we just live and let live
Realizing that this is best for us
Until death do us part.





Until I see, sculptor
Spread of fine light 
Done in Carrara white, 
Divine hand, O Mentor! 

From your toil inspire
A conception, holy mother's.
Diana, Helen, Mary, aye virgin
A soft serenity, a plain memory.

My belief, onward, 
Clasp of wings, a dove
As release to joy, or a Roman
Noble, with olives on forehead.

A turbaned statue, 
Hats off, inscribed epithet, 
Tolstoy's Helene, a fancy
Imitates nature, back-wards.

Caged emotion, 
For you shall let it flow, 
Give it a soul, walking amongst, 
Such mortal step, languid.

The smile is from 
Frozen lips, eye lids heavy
Flutter on blind eyes, 
Outward in stone, bacchius breast.



Over the ocean of life’s commotion
 We sail till the night comes on.
Sail and sail in a tiny boat, 
 Drifting wherever the billows go.
Out on the treacherous sea afloat, 
 Beat by the cruel winds that blow, 
Hither and thither our boat is drawn, 
Till the day dies out and the night comes on.

Over a meadow of light and shadow
 We wander with weary feet, 
Seeking a bauble men call "Fame, "
 Grasping the dead-sea fruit named "wealth, "
Finding each but an empty name, 
 And the night – the night steals on by stealth, 
And we count the season of slumber sweet, 
When hope lies dead in the arms of defeat.

Over the river a great Forever
 Stretches beyond our sight.
But I know by the glistening pearly gates
 Afar from the region of strife and sin, 
A beautiful angel always waits
 To welcome the sheep of the shepherd in.
And out of the shadows of gloom and night, 
They enter the mansion of peace and light. 

From my box of perfume, genie
Fly, amber, musk, oudh and henna
From the smoke, outlines sandy silhouettes
Smell of earth, damp warmth from oak
Sojourns lone, loves distant, a door’s creek
Banish the moon, stars and dew
Until tomorrow’s sun, don’t wake me up.




Enjoying a better life anew
Their memory shall we carry through
Until we again rendezvous


Henceforth I deal in whispers. 
The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song. 

Men hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and sellers are there. 
But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work. 

Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time; 
and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum. 

Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, 
but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him; 
and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!"



Arrest me aura who is it 
who goads there? Who sends 
shadows up m’ deep end? 
Tweety? Pooh pooh 
not, friend — not 
knowing where the bodies get ferried 
disturbs me sometimes. Oh, it’s you lot."
         Out here on the symbolic prong 
there’s a bar with loud music 
burying beef, lettuce, pickles, mayo 
and hundreds of miles of fried bread. 
"You can dance attendance if you 
want to, old salt," cajoles 
egghead. 


Darkened moon, why do you weep? 
Lifeless, listless, your children yearn for sleep.
Kept in chains and bound by laws, 
Sleep is mauled by anger's maws.

Still the anger that clouds your heart, 
Lest you tear a family's love apart.
Did you not teach your children that play is fair? 
Even if hatred and rage are still there.


Quell your heart and its burning flames, 
For burning bridges was never a game.
Smell the stench and if you feel it gnaw, 
There are darkened souls that hope you feel guilt, for there is more.

Corruption will give what corruption will get, 
So please don't make this the only place I have left to place my bet. 

The summer grasses
All that remains
Of brave soldiers dreams


As my head touches the pillow, 
I hear my child, next door, 
Sob as if her heart were breaking, 
Like she'll cry for evermore.

Tiptoeing softly along the landing, 
Wiping my tears as I go.
To wrap my arms around her, 
My distress, I mustn't show.

I hold her in my arms real tight, 
'Hush daughter, let me say, 
To remember daddy's with you, 
We didn't say goodbye today.

For your dad, he's always with you, 
In your thoughts and in your heart.
He'll be with us all forever, 
Because, of us, he is a part.

So come child, dry your eyes now, 
Please remember you make sure, 
That your dad, who lives inside you, 
Knows you're not crying anymore.


'Suffer the pen
That has to write what I say, 
Suffer the words
That have to serve my brain, 
Suffer the light
Serving the dark
It seems unworthy
Of this task.
Wounds open and bleeding, 
Made worse by the day, 
Silence will eat me, 
And relish my pain.
All of my deamons
Come back again, 
These are the words
That I can not say. 


I let my demons fallow never led
Don’t let your mind be what these demons feed
Looking back in retrospect
Seeing all the mistakes that I regret
Tasting a high that helps my mind to forget
The bar of soap can’t wash the hands free of sin
The mirror above the sink doesn’t show the reflection within
Her eyes filled with pain
I sympathize for her lushes lips in vain
Her hair flows all around with her thin eyebrows touching her bangs 
The nape of her neck bleeds from the sinking fangs
Her tragedy filled with mocking comedies
Let them laugh, don’t let her fall
She waits for a hand to reach out and catch her falling soul
Pay the pipers toll
Maybe then she can redeem herself
Reestablish her health
The thin line she tip-toes between love and hate
Trip one time and cross the line and all is up for debate
This falling soul is tormented by the loneliness of the fall
She can’t feel the touch but can hear the call
Her heart has a sorrow filled tale to tell
Reach out to her falling soul don’t let all efforts fail
Hands taken away burned not by open flame, but hatred of hell
So this tale of horrific tragedy couldn’t be written
Yet it was and it is and will be until her soul is caught


In the cold, still night, 
A scream could be heard. 
The people whisper; 
The people ignore. 
For if they act, 
They will be next. 

Silence was followed. 
All was still. 
Deep crimson stained the path. 
The figure lay froken. 
Eyes deep pits of fear, 
She stared at the stars above. 
Now fading, 
She cried, 'Good bye.' 


After her breathing stopped, 
Menacing laughter could be heard. 
As he walked away, 
Darkness consumed him. 


Those who kill 
Will be trapped forever, 
Locked inside themselves

thunder-passion roared
lightning-desire blinded
under thick black clouds
her pale skin came alive
with multiple hidden hues 

she began to breathe


and like those two mighty trees
entwined by the field-bund
they stood there-two ancient bodies
still in a deep sea of passion

the elements folded them in.

I travel a perilous journey
The road oft called Life
Filled with great Beasts of Evil
And not ever short of strife

This path has become icy
A dark, thin road I walk
I struggle not to slip
While at me the beasts do mock

Out of a dense dark fog
I see you drawing near
To guide my lost soul
And relieve me of my fear

You grab hold of my hand
And guide me to safety
You show me a warm light
Where we can both be free

Together we are held
In a state of pure sweet bliss
With this love that we share
We embrace and share a kiss

Never again will I walk
On that dark icy trail
For now I have you
With whom I can forever sail


I dream of them
These mysterious girls in my mind

And yet I can never remember their faces
I never wake with their names on my lips
And all my life I search for only a glimsp
Of their long flowing hair
Or their gleaming playful eyes

These dreams to me are like Heaven
Because I always have a beautiful, wonderful time
We laugh and dance, we hug and kiss
We fly and love, together it seems like a lifetime 

But then these dreams are like Hell
Because I know when I wake
That these dreams that were made
Are just my the whispers of my mind's desire

I dream of them
These mysterious girls in my mind
But alas, never shall I seem them anymore


The tree of life
From the darkness
In the hope 
Of getting into the air
To the sunlight
Flowers sprouting
In anticipation
The darkness inside
In hideous curves
Fighting the way out
And suddenly feeling
Life
Waves after waves
Happiness like a forlorn desire
Like spring
Like rain
Like the beloved face
The ocean like eyes
The shine of love
Descends
The tree of life
Seeking air
And sunlight


When the fantasy has come to an end
The mind’s power to imagine things
That pleases the senses
The beautiful girl of the yore
In secret desires alone shared with her mother
The life’s spring in full bloom
And in anticipation of the years to come
The child yet unborn but waiting for its turn
The greater being has ordained its birth
And one day
The child suckling the breast of the mother
Motherhood’s great feeling in a world that is wrought
With injustice

That man who once came and when he sat for food
He did eat like he had been hungry for centuries
Born was he to a mother
In the wit’s great drama unfolding in favor of the rich
And the powerful
The mother looking like a cow that has just given birth
To her calf and cleaning with her tongue
Deep groans of love and breasts full of milk
Motherhood coming out of the sublimation
Of some acts in dirt or the erotics in mankind
The face of the child did glow
The mother’s ultimate possession
The spirituality 
He may be the chosen one

Incoherent thou speak
O heart in torment
A story thou canst narrate
In one session
The chronicles of centuries
The prophets the sages
Could not unfold the secret
Of life and death
Love’s bitter meanings are opening on thy conscious
Yet thou art on the first page
The dervish’s whirl or deep meditation
And one day
Thou shalt be the guest of that superior being


and on that stilled night 
in that balcony overlooking
the sea that seemed 
to merge with the sky
the two stood alone watching
a placid sea and a sky
that radiated subdued moonlight
teasing each other endlessly-

the soft flowing wind 
tickled and adorned them
their inner fire gave them
a queer glow that reflected
on their parched skin



and then you came
with no paraphernalia
as unobtrusively  as you alone can
and led me home away from home
clasping my left hand
with your right and drawing it
close to your heart
as if nothing can allow it to slip. 
i assumed a young and foolish persona
on the dark rickety road we traveled by
in that child-like glee
walking me into moonlight, 
you showed me my home

the clock stopped
the distant sea stood as witness
as i sealed my heart
with words of love
you scribbled. 

rs


You came in my dream
Asked the meaning of love
You met me for a long time
I did not know 
But a restless dream
Talking to you
A walk in the meadows
I understood
What you wanted to say
The meaning of love
Is freedom
From surroundings
Breaking the bond
But that too
Is not sufficient
In the great scheme
And in the deep mystery 
Of love
We both are losers
But let’s loose
With grace and dignity


I gaze and gaze
For hours and hours
Day and night
On that one point
The centre of the flower
The eye of the bird
The tree of life
The centre of the moon
The motifs on my carpet
The small fish in a pond
That come out
At night and under the moon
Flying vegetable colors
Silk and wool
Cotton and gold
That speaks to me
In innumerable way
you were made in perfection and love
you were given great life from above
yet you make him cry
do you not know why

you were given the power of love
you were given the power from above
yet you chose to stay 
far and far away


~

you don't turn night into day, 
with your thoughts, with your actions and words.

you could have turned the night into day
yet you chose to stay far far away
he put his life on the line, 

conquered death and was killed all for you.

Do you know how he cries, 
do you know how he hurts.
Do you know how he longs for your return. 

Turn back, turn back and return, 
Turn back, turn back and return. 


Wiggie hat hangs over a teeny face
Of seventy I am sure, may be more, 
Made from the thick hair of Transoxania.
The field marshal in the manner of desert snake, 
Like raccoon pated the backs of mules. He came
Riding on. Girlie mane, would you be a man, 
Of bald head, like some Baldwin 
Or we are used to grave faced Winston.

O soil of many rivers, didsn't thou 
Gave birth to men of dignity and demeanor, 
Yea, our coastal breed, speak through wire 
From London. The cult, and the other's a humor, 
His son in lap. The language of the body 
Of the National is, abusive, uncontrolled.
The habit of rote, to the spokesperson of divine, 
Though wears a pink tie, but is fresh from seminary.


 

You mustn't swim till you're six weeks old, 
Or your head will be sunk by your heels; 
And summer gales and Killer Whales 
   Are bad for baby seals. 
Are bad for baby seals, dear rat, 
   As bad as bad can be. 
But splash and grow strong, 
And you can't be wrong, 
   Child of the Open Sea


Being a lovable spouse
She cared the husband dauntless 
Nurtured a nest of five chicks
Her selfless, painless and passionate self
Upheld benevolence 

Smile was her grace
Soft talk was her praise
Calmness, the value she hoisted
Care she shared being in a live race

Every hair follicle of chicks she raised
Knew her caressing finger touch best
Every taste bud's need in the den 
Was catered to, belittling none

Never fluttered wings above the warren
Yet raised all chicks to traverse horizon
Carrying her vision unto next generation
Truly honored mother par excellence

Tireless grandma, as she willfully chose
Was robbed of her breath, in broad day light
By a heartless raunchy biped primate 
Worth not letting to share the air we breathe

Any super power of any divinity 
Why keep such elements so vicious 
On this soil to play with social fairness


"Unto Me?" I do not know you—
Where may be your House?

Now—of Paradise"—

Wagons—have you—to convey me?
This is far from Thence—

"Arms of Mine—sufficient Phaeton—
Trust Omnipotence"—

I am spotted—"I am Pardon"—
I am small—"The Least
Is esteemed in Heaven the Chiefest—
Occupy my House"—


A boy's young fancy taketh love
Most simply, with the rind thereof;
A boy's young fancy tasteth more
The rind, than the deific core.
Ah, Sweet! to cast away the slips
Of unessential rind, and lips
Fix on the immortal core, is well;
But heard'st thou ever any tell
Of such a fool would take for food
Aspect and scent, however good,
Of sweetest core Love's orchards grow?
Should such a phantast please him so,
Love where Love's reverent self denies
Love to feed, but with his eyes,
All the savour, all the touch,
Another's--was there ever such?
Such were fool, if fool there be;
Such fool was I, and was for thee!
But if the touch and savour too
Of this fruit--say, Sweet, of you--
You unto another give
For sacrosanct prerogative,
Yet even scent and aspect were
Some elected Second's share;
And one, gone mad, should rest content
With memory of show and scent;
Would not thyself vow, if there sigh
Such a fool--say, Sweet, as I--
Treble frenzy it must be
Still to love, and to love thee?

Yet had I torn (man knoweth not,
Nor scarce the unweeping angels wot
Of such dread task the lightest part)
Her fingers from about my heart.
Heart, did we not think that she
Had surceased her tyranny?
Heart, we bounded, and were free!
O sacrilegious freedom!--Till
She came, and taught my apostate will
The winnowed sweet mirth cannot guess
And tear-fined peace of hopefulness;
Looked, spake, simply touched, and went.
Now old pain is fresh content,
Proved content is unproved pain.
Pangs fore-tempted, which in vain
I, faithless, have denied, now bud
To untempted fragrance and the mood
Of contrite heavenliness; all days
Joy affrights me in my ways;
Extremities of old delight
Afflict me with new exquisite
Virgin piercings of surprise,--
Stung by those wild brown bees, her eyes


Somewhere at some time
They committed themselves to me
And so, I was!
Small, but I WAS!
Tiny, in shape
Lusting to live
I hung in my pulsing cave.
Soon they knew of me
My mother --my father.
I had no say in my being
I lived on trust
And love
Tho' I couldn't think
Each part of me was saying
A silent 'Wait for me
I will bring you love!'
I was taken
Blind, naked, defenseless
By the hand of one
Whose good name
Was graven on a brass plate
in Wimpole Street,
and dropped on the sterile floor
of a foot operated plastic waste
bucket.
To take my brief.
The cot I might have warmed
Stood in Harrod's shop window.
When my passing was told
My father smiled.
No grief filled my empty space.
My death was celebrated
With tickets to see Danny la Rue
Who was pretending to be a woman
Like my mother was. 


Soul rejoices by enlightened grace, 
virile breeze smooches passion by mirth
heart touches tunes even million miles apart
earthly rhythm seems to reel thorough red
 
fear of falling never baffles grace of love
as the beauty of grace overpowers sorrow
when reef of reason entices upon the blue
words of thirsty desire rambles bewildered
 
fire never finds distinction of new and old
as the skin of love inebriates by midas touch
today forsakes yesterday into to furrows of time
breath expires slowly into future uncertain

yet grave fails to consume the art of love
as fairy tales are the legends unto this day
patience still holds on like stillness of stone
halcyon meanders beyond bitten by moments


Behold, I bring you a straw to hang onto, 
for it is cocktail hour and you are clearly drowning, 
untroubled by many things. Perhaps 
dishing out cigars etc. 
to scores of fat old roosters 
isn’t quite your idea of visiting Uncle. 
Perhaps it isn’t mine either. Maybe 
we both got here by mistake.
Whatever. After taking a bath 
in your opinions, a feeling 
of distant calm emerges 
refreshed, albeit defeated by you, 
long-legged attendant. Why shoot silent 
bullets at me as the last man standing 
comes out with his hands up? 
Soon you’ll be an old rooster too, 
offering a claw to hang onto.


I wanted to see you, 
In dreams, 
and always, 
It lingers, 
Like mists, 
and smokes, 
In spaces, 
before my visions, 
but in realities people, 
find epmty mosaics, 
filled with airs, 
rather beautiful fluids, 
Like wines of dreams, 
so in a jiffy, 
I saw you, 
In a crowd, 
like a cloud, 
below a hot sun, 
I felt everything drifting, 
in my eyes, 
i found my self, 
alone, 
and nothing, 
alive around me, 
I walked a journey, 
on a barren road of life, 
and smokes became still, 
before my eyes,


Your Approach. 

Mine eyes behold
The view you're gracing
Your beauty unfold
My heart starts racing

Your Encroah. 

The tension grows
While towards pacing
Your radiance flows
It's fear I'm bracing

My Abroach. 

The entrancement
Has my mind failing
Your smile's enhancement
Sends my heart sailing

My Reproach. 

I'm Insecure
My secret endure
Eyes opened?

UNWIND my riddle. 
Cruel as hawks the hours fly; 
Wounded men seldom come home to die; 
The hard waves see an arm flung high; 
Scorn hits strong because of a lie; 
Yet there exists a mystic tie. 
Unwind my riddle. 

There is so many things I need to say, 
There is this unwritten words that I can not understand, 
Who is this girl who had become the girl she is not, 
What is this unwritten words say, 
How do I know if this was meant to be, 
How can I understand something that wasn’t meant to be read, 
Unwritten words that shall not say, 
Unwritten words that shall not be read, 
What is this, 
What am I doing, 
Why can’t I just read the unwritten words that are meant to be said by me, 
Why am I out of place, 
What does it mean, 
Why am I confused about this unwritten words, 
These words that can not be read, 
These feelings can not be controlled, 
Please tell me what this unwritten words say. 


When I called you in your garden
Mango blooms were rich in fragrance -
Why did you remain so distant,
Keep your doors so tightly fastened?
Blossoms grew to ripe fruit-clusters -
Your rejected my cuppded handfuls,
Closed your eyes to perfectness.

In the fierce harsh storms of Baisakh,
Golden ripened fruit fell tumbling.
'Dust, I said, 'defiles such offerings:
Let your hands be heaven to them.'
Still you showed no friendliness.

Lampless were your doors at evening,
Pitch-black as I played my vina.
How the starlight twanged my heartstrings!
How I set my vina dancing!
You showed no responsiveness.

Sad birds twittered sleeplessly,
Calling, calling lost companions.
Gone the right time for our union -
Low the moon while still you brooded,
Sunk in lonely pensiveness.

Who can understand another!
Heart cannot restrain its passion.
I had hoped that some remaining
Tear-soaked memories would sway you,
Stir your feet to lightsomeness.




Twice ten years old not fully told 
    since nature gave me breath, 
My race is run, my thread spun, 
    lo, here is fatal death. 
All men must die, and so must I; 
    this cannot be revoked. 
    when he so high provoked. 
Yet live I shall, this life's but small, 
    in place of highest bliss, 
Where I shall have all I can crave, 
    no life is like to this. 
For what's this but care and strife 
    since first we came from womb? 
Our strength doth waste, our time doth haste, 
    and then we go to th' tomb. 
O bubble blast, how long can'st last? 
    that always art a breaking, 
No sooner blown, but dead and gone, 
    ev'n as a word that's speaking. 
O whilst I live this grace me give, 
    I doing good may be, 
Then death's arrest I shall count best, 
    because it's Thy decree; 
Bestow much cost there's nothing lost, 
    to make salvation sure, 
O great's the gain, though got with pain, 
    comes by profession pure. 
The race is run, the field is won, 
    the victory's mine I see; 
Forever known, thou envious foe, 
    the foil belongs to thee.


    Upon Concluded Lives
There's nothing cooler falls—
Than Life's sweet Calculations—
The mixing Bells and Palls—

Make Lacerating Tune—
To Ears the Dying Side—
'Tis Coronal—and Funeral—
Saluting—in the Road—Bles't bee thy Name, who did'st restore
To health my Daughter dear
When death did seem ev'n to approach,
And life was ended near.
Gravnt shee remember what thov'st done,
And celebrate thy Praise;
And let her Conversation say,
Shee loues thee all thy Dayes. 


O thou Most High who rulest all 
And hear'st the prayers of thine, 
And my petition sign.

Into Thy everlasting arms Of mercy 
Keep and preserve My husband, 
my dear friend.

Nor nought could keep him back. 
Then let Thy promise joy his heart, 
O help and be not slack.

Thou art my strength and stay, 
Thou see'st how weak and frail I am, 
Hide not Thy face away.

I in obedience to Thy will 
Thou knowest did submit. 
It was my duty so to do; 

Unthankfulness for mercies past 
Impute Thou not to me. 
Was to sing praise to Thee.

And send them prosperous gales. 
Thy goodness never fails.

Unto Thy work he hath in hand 
And favour in their eyes to whom 
He shall make his address.

To wilderness hast brought; 
Let not Thine own inheritance 
Be sold away for nought.

But tokens of Thy favour give, 
With joy send back my dear 
That I and all Thy servants may 
Rejoice with heavenly cheer.

Him whom Thou gavest me 
That we together may sing praise 
Forever unto Thee.

And the remainder of our days 
Shall consecrated be 
With an engaged heart to sing 
All praises unto Thee. 

I here resigne into thy hand
The Son of Prayers, of vowes, of teares,
The child I stay'd for many yeares.
Thou heard'st me then, and gav'st him me;
Hear me again, I giue him Thee.
For sure thy Grace on him is shown.
No freind I haue like Thee to trust,
For mortall helpes are brittle Dvst.
Protect him there, and bring him back;
And if thou shalt spare me a space,
That I again may see his face,
Then shall I celebrate thy Praise,
And Blesse the for't even all my Dayes.
If otherwise I goe to Rest,
Thy Will bee done, for that is best;
Perswade my heart I shall him see
For ever happefy'd with Thee. 


SOON did he Almighty Giver of all rest
Take those dear young Ones to a fearless nest;
And in Death's arms has long reposed the Friend
For whom this simple Register was penned.
Thanks to the moth that spared it for our eyes;
And Strangers even the slighted Scroll may prize,
Moved by the touch of kindred sympathies.
For--save the calm, repentance sheds o'er strife
Raised by remembrances of misused life,
The light from past endeavours purely willed 
And by Heaven's favour happily fulfilled;
Save hope that we, yet bound to Earth, may share
The joys of the Departed--what so fair
As blameless pleasure, not without some tears,
Reviewed through Love's transparent veil of years


Sometimes there be a silent chaos
following the shock and grief of loss.
May I offer you a cup 
of Young's Green Tea, 
isn't that what old folks drink these day's; 
ahhh, but not in your cup, I know; , 
how 'bout an eght ounce bottle of Classic Coke? 
The kind they drank from til' plastic ruled, 
that swiveled green tinted bottle, 
and a cap with a cork for freshness; 
That was my Father's cup o' tea.
 

The unthinkables tend to offer - 
options.  opportunity
to appreciate the past
and the memories we warm 
our grieving hearts with, 
or at least be closed, opaque 
to the shock angst and rue
that the present and future holds,  
and instead ensconce in the quelling fields, 
of  Life, laghter and tea leaves.


For Tomorrows another day; 
that's what my Father always said
whenever silence seemed to hold
its breath for suffocation, 
from life's most shocking ends 
that most of us fear openly; 
when day and night are same 
to the trance induced shadows 
of memories hazed by grey-
en route to anthracite, 
where cognizance takes void
from matters of the Mind; 

My Father feared this most
whenever he'd see someone -
bearing the heavy cross
of the mortally ossified, 
staring paralyticly    
at the nothingness before them.
No way to live he'd say
no dignity to this! 
My Father was a good and very wise man, 
though he never drank a drop of tea.


In anguish of my heart replete with woes, 
And wasting pains, which best my body knows, 
In tossing slumbers on my wakeful bed, 
Bedrenched with tears that flowed from mournful head, 
Till nature had exhausted all her store, 
Then eyes lay dry, disabled to weep more; 
And looking up unto his throne on high, 
Who sendeth help to those in misery; 
He chased away those clouds and let me see 
My anchor cast i' th' vale with safety. 
He eased my soul of woe, my flesh of pain, 
and brought me to the shore from troubled main. 


Someplace
A field of flowers 
Rousing under remnants of the dawn: 
Out there! from death, I rose 
Above the silent many –
A distant will-o'-the-wisp
Reflecting under airs of minor ninths – 
How rich the ambience they threw! 

What theme of prosody 
Had rendered me? –
Tho’ silent were its words: 
A broken soul in pulsing pain – 
Thou mustn’t guess what goes behind 
The sick and ghostly screen of war! 

In sallow-grey and other ashen hues, 
Disrobed of warming flesh 
That reassures the bones, 
A twisted pose 
Portrayed my physicality – 
Not unlike the carcass of a prey; 

But as a cloud of thought, I mused, 
Exacerbating woes
Collected in a life dispatched 
In freely flowing blood, 
Conferring crimson shades
Upon the arid lakes aflood
With glorious tides of nascent buds
Begetting innocence.

And as we glowed in ruddy shades, 
I asked: ‘What future lies ahead? 
What terror trades? ’

He first deceased; she for a little tried 
To live without him, liked it not, and died. 

I ask'd thee oft what poets thou hast read,
And lik'st the best?  Still thou repli'st, The dead.
--I shall, ere long, with green turfs cover'd be;
Then sure thou'lt like, or thou wilt envy, me. 


I have lost, and lately, these
Many dainty mistresses:--
Stately Julia, prime of all;
Sapho next, a principal:
Smooth Anthea, for a skin
White, and heaven-like crystalline:
Sweet Electra, and the choice
Myrha, for the lute and voice.
Next, Corinna, for her wit,
And the graceful use of it;
With Perilla:--All are gone;
Only Herrick's left alone,
For to number sorrow by
Their departures hence, and die. 


Have ye beheld (with much delight)
A red rose peeping through a white?
Or else a cherry (double graced)
Within a lily? Centre placed?
Or ever marked the pretty beam
A strawberry shows half drowned in cream?
Or seen rich rubies blushing through
A pure smooth pearl, and orient too?
So like to this, nay all the rest,
Is each neat niplet of her breast. 


YE brood of conscience--Spectres! that frequent
The bad Man's restless walk, and haunt his bed--
Fiends in your aspect, yet beneficent
In act, as hovering Angels when they spread
Their wings to guard the unconscious Innocent--
Slow be the Statutes of the land to share
A laxity that could not but impair
'Your' power to punish crime, and so prevent.
And ye, Beliefs! coiled serpent-like about
The adage on all tongues, 'Murder will out,' 
How shall your ancient warnings work for good
In the full might they hitherto have shown,
If for deliberate shedder of man's blood
Survive not Judgment that requires his own


Upon the road of my life, 
Passed me many fair creatures, 
Clothed all in white, and radiant. 
To one, finally, I made speech: 
"Who art thou?" 
But she, like the others, 
Kept cowled her face, 
And answered in haste, anxiously, 
"I am good deed, forsooth; 
You have often seen me
 

"Not uncowled," I made reply. 
And with rash and strong hand, 
Though she resisted, 
I drew away the veil 
And gazed at the features of vanity. 
She, shamefaced, went on; 
And after I had mused a time, 
I said of myself, 
"Fool!"Dazled thus with height of place,
Whilst our Hopes our wits Beguile,
No man marks the narrow space
'Twixt a Prison and a Smile.


Then since Fortunes favours fade,
You that in her arms do sleep,
Learn to swim and not to wade;
For the Hearts of Kings are deep.

But if Greatness be so blind,
As to trust in Towers of Air,
Let it be with Goodness lin'd, 
That at least the Fall be fair.

Then though darkned you shall say,
When Friends fail and Princes frown,
Vertue is the roughest way,
But proves at night a Bed of Down. 


Seek new expressions, do the circle square, 
And thrust into straight corners of poor wit 
Thee, who art cornerless and infinite— 
I would but bless Thy name, not name Thee now 
—And Thy gifts are as infinite as Thou— 
Fix we our praises therefore on this one, 
That, as thy blessed Spirit fell upon 
These Psalms' first author in a cloven tongue 
—For 'twas a double power by which he sung 
The highest matter in the noblest form— 
So thou hast cleft that Spirit, to perform 
That work again, and shed it here, upon 
Two, by their bloods, and by Thy Spirit one ; 
A brother and a sister, made by Thee 
The organ, where Thou art the harmony. 
Two that make one John Baptist's holy voice, 
And who that Psalm, 'Now let the Isles rejoice,' 
Have both translated, and applied it too, 
Both told us what, and taught us how to do. 
They show us islanders our Joy, our King ; 
They tell us why, and teach us how to sing. 
Make all this all three choirs, heaven, earth, and spheres ; 
The first, Heaven, hath a song, but no man hears ; 
The spheres have music, but they have no tongue, 
Their harmony is rather danced than sung ; 
But our third choir, to which the first gives ear 
—For Angels learn by what the Church does here— 
This choir hath all. The organist is he 
The songs are these, which heaven's high holy Muse 
Whisper'd to David, David to the Jews ; 
And David's successors in holy zeal, 
In forms of joy and art do re-reveal 
To us so sweetly and sincerely too, 
That I must not rejoice as I would do, 
When I behold that these Psalms are become 
So well attired abroad, so ill at home, 
So well in chambers, in Thy Church so ill, 
As I can scarce call that reform'd until 
This be reform'd ; would a whole state present 
A lesser gift than some one man hath sent ? 
And shall our Church unto our Spouse and King 
More hoarse, more harsh than any other, sing ? 
For that we pray, we praise Thy name for this, 
Which, by this Moses and this Miriam, is 
Already done ; and as those Psalms we call, 
—Though some have other authors—David's all, 
So though some have, some may some Psalms translate, 
We Thy Sidneian psalms shall celebrate, 
And, till we come th' extemporal song to sing 
—Learn'd the first hour that we see the King, 
Who hath translated those translators—may 
These their sweet learned labours all the way 
Be as our tuning, that when hence we part, 
We may fall in with them, and sing our part 


Time was upon
The wing, to fly away;
And I call'd on
Him but awhile to stay;
But he'd be gone,
For aught that I could say.

He held out then
A writing, as he went,
And ask'd me, when
False man would be content
To pay again

An hour-glass,
In which were sands but few,
As he did pass,
He shew'd,--and told me too
Mine end near was;--
And so away he flew. 

Below poem is a tribute written in
September of but never before 
posted on this site.  

Now it is. 



My friend died last night, 
loved playing the Blues, 
held rock 'n roll sacred, 
Fender, his golden calf; 
one day he sent away 
for a two dollar book
on how to play guitar, 
what a rush it gave him; 
became a twang master
in just three years, 
inbetween writing lyrics
that would make Stalin cry, 
and, all the while  
making those 
around him smile wide, 
and realize what a gift 
it was to be afforded 
the honor and privilege 
to call this man your friend.

Foresight and fortitude 
elements that fueled
his sprite, brilliant mind.
Sincerety and compassion, 
virtues that warmed 
our Hearts fueled by his.
And, his altruistic ways, 
always reaching. 
reaching out 
with both hands
and sound words
in helping others shoulder 
crosses of their own.


And, even.  

in 'his' darkness 
when, challenge fronted him, 
it were these special virtues
that propelled him to fight, 
attack, destroy and conquer-
refusing to give in 
to whatever he wanted or stood for.

And, the Cross he shouldered
was thick-hulked and mighty, 
jaggedly splintered. 
clearly far too much 
for the ordinary hero, to carry.
But understand this: 
Paul was far from ordinary. 

And, so, as he did everything  
in his far too stunted life, 
he carried his Cross with pride, 
courage.  

without complaint, rue, 
or resignation. . 

and fought! 


You see, Paul was created uniquely, 
in a myriad of ways.
A friend you could count on
in good or bad times, 
for loyalty, support and truth.
A person that possessed a penchant
for finding that miniscule flicker of light
amongst the darkest of places and spaces.
Someone, who without realizing it, 
was a walking library of pertinent knowledge
educating many, myself included 
on a potpouri of information ranging from
music and  sports  
or stories of our penrod past, 
to serious topic and issues
that tapped philosophic ideaology, 
that would ultimately result in a forum of
socratic debate, a place where Pauls erudite
was always in sync and in overdrive. 
Yet, as opinionated as he could be, 
he'd always listen and respect an opposing view.
Suffice to say he was a humble idealist
who influenced, and was a mentor to the many 
who sought his assistance or advice.


Time only knows modes, 
forward and relentless. You cannot 
turn it back. 
It will not negotiate with you, for if it did, 
I would have negotiated for years of  retro time 
so I could have done things different, better
in spending more time and enjoying that time
with the best friend I ever had.  
The old cliche that Life is too short, 
is not a cliche at all.
It is gospel that is proven true 
every moment someone we love passes on.





Paul bore his crosses, with herculean prowess, 
with poise, character and dignity.
Not to  my surprise, he handled his illness 
just like another day at the office of a job that 
he would rather not have but at the same time 
would never give the company the satisfaction of
quitting! 
The last time I visited him,days before he passed, 
I brought him something he had requested days earlier, 
A Haggen-Daz, Strawberry milk shake.
He drank half of it, I swear, in less than seconds.
And, as he always did whenever and whatever he ate. 
he handed me the shake, and said, 'here, have some'
as genorousity was yet another virtue that Paul was 
never short on, despite the fact he knew I  hated straw-
berry, which then reminded me of his stint as a stand-up 
comic. I always told Paul he should play cards for a living
as he could easily don a poker face at a drop of a coin.
But, of course, Paul, per usual had far more agressive 
aspirations, so, instead of shuffling cards, 
he took his poker-puss on the road and shuffled 
on stage as a stand-up comic, playing comedy clubs 
and appearing on u-tube with that poker face as his 
ace-in the-hole of success! 


Yes, Paul was very special, and because so,  
I honestly believe that his passage 
to that better place never pit-stopped at
No, I believe that on September h
that his day began with that Cross still
upon him, but that his day ended with
a light shoulder and embraced by a Man 
who knew first hand what it was like to 
bear a heavy Cross.


I'll miss you, Pal 'o mine.  

And remember, 
you're not off the hook just yet.  

You have 
a new job now, a most important one
In watching over us all.  

all who loved you. 

And finally, please forgive me for not
knowing better to be a far better friend.
I guess we're never too old or wise to be
taught a lesson on the importance of
making the most of what time you never 
really know you have, and sharing it with
those who have earned your time. You did, 
Paul, and so much more. Rock On, dude, 
until we meet again & what a party it will
 be, that I can honestly see Heaven sending
the two of us back for a do-over! Stay close. 
I love you, man!  







Wrinkles no more are, or no less,
Than beauty turn'd to sourness. 

I am upset and confused 
by my upsetting news.
my fiance played and used me.
then left with sharp and painful news.

I called him before he went to work like I normally do, 
then he said that it was over.
I called him back and then asked why he said that.
He told me cause of one little stupid arguement, 
and he had been cheating on me
cause it was a trial period.

painful and hurt is all I am left with


Again I feel as if i'm jumping
from the bridge with bungee cord 
ironically called 'the devil's tail'
upside-down my heart gets 
suddenly into my head
my mind now listening to it
the sound of lonely pulsar 
knocked out of its orbit
still pulling devil by the tail 
 Of so many things


     
You keep on leaning-, 
     Towards what the negative brings
     , 
       Like taking the side of the devil
       , 
         When the thoughts are angel sweet
         , 
           Conflict seems to build your passion-, 
             And makes your life complete.

Uptight Lady
, you’ve got to lighten up-, 
  Uptight Lady
  ., too much caffeine in your cup.
    Please relax
    , Uptight Lady
    , it's a fact! ! ! 
      Calm down. ., take a deep breath. ., 
         This is not a personal attack!


The hills are always far away.
He knows the broken roads, and moves
In circles tracked within his head.
Before he wakes and has his say,
The river which he claims he loves
Is dry, and all the winds lie dead.

At dawn he never sees the skies
Which, silently, are born again.
Nor feels the shadows of the night
Recline their fingers on his eyes.
He welcomes neither sun nor rain.
His landscape has no depth or height.

The city like a passion burns.
He dreams of morning walks, alone,
And floating on a wave of sand.
But still his mind its traffic turns
Away from beach and tree and stone
To kindred clamour close at hand.


O youngest of the giant brood 
Of cities far-renowned;
In wealth and power thou hast passed
Thy rivals at a bound;
And how wilt thou be crowned? 

"Weave me no palace-wreath of pride,"
The royal city said;
"Nor forge an iron fortress-wall
To frown upon my head;
But let me wear a diadem
Of Wisdom's towers instead
 


And so upon her island height
She worked her will forsooth,
She set upon her rocky brow
A citadel of Truth,
A house of Light, a home of Thought,
A shrine of noble Youth. 

Stand here, ye City College towers,
And look both up and down; 
Remember all who wrought for you
Within the toiling town; 
Remember all they thought for you, 
And all the hopes they brought for you,
And be the City's Crown.

Wherever I am, there's always Pooh,
There's always Pooh and Me.
Whatever I do, he wants to do,
"Where are you going today?" says Pooh:
"Well, that's very odd 'cos I was too.
Let's go together," says Pooh, says he.
"Let's go together," says Pooh.

"What's twice eleven?" I said to Pooh.
("Twice what?" said Pooh to Me.)
"I think it ought to be twenty-two

"
"Just what I think myself," said Pooh.
"It wasn't an easy sum to do,
But that's what it is," said Pooh, said he.
"That's what it is," said Pooh.

"Let's look for dragons," I said to Pooh.
"Yes, let's," said Pooh to Me.
We crossed the river and found a few-
"Yes, those are dragons all right," said Pooh.
"As soon as I saw their beaks I knew.
That's what they are," said Pooh, said he.
"That's what they are," said Pooh.

"Let's frighten the dragons," I said to Pooh.
"That's right," said Pooh to Me.
"I'm not afraid," I said to Pooh,
And I held his paw and I shouted "Shoo!
Silly old dragons!"- and off they flew.

"I wasn't afraid," said Pooh, said he,
"I'm never afraid with you
 


So wherever I am, there's always Pooh,
There's always Pooh and Me.
"What would I do?" I said to Pooh,
"If it wasn't for you," and Pooh said: "True,
It isn't much fun for One, but Two,
Can stick together, says Pooh, says he. 
"That's how it is," says Pooh. 


We seem to always seek that need, 
To find a comfort feeding to please.
Wishing we were given space. 
When it is wanted, 
And when it should take place.


Use my frustration, 
As a means for your motivation.
You always bring me there, 
Without concern or care.
Use my frustration, 
In re-inactments as libations.
Use my sweated brow to rehearse. 
How to implement your curse! 

We seem to find time to criticize, 
Those close to us and on our side.
Nit-picking everything they do. 
With a disregard of loyalty, 
And a devotion shown that's proved! 
Believing we 'must' be satisfied, 
Or a temper tantrum undenied. 
Begins to break through, 
With pouts and shouts and cussing spewed! 

Use my frustration, 
As a means for your motivation.
You always bring me there, 
Without concern or care.
Use my frustration, 
In re-inactments as libations.
Use my sweated brow to rehearse. 
How to implement your curse! 

Use my frustration, 
As a means for your motivation.
And when you've completely exhausted me. 
Tell others how I am selfish.
How difficult it is. 
To live with 'me'.
Use my frustration, 
As a means for your motivation.
Create those scenes how I've treated you mean. 
And when you pack and decide to leave, 
Don't be surprised if no one believes your grief! 

Everytime you bitch and whine. 
Noticed very few listen to you each time

I once was a girl

who smiled and played

But now I'm in the darkness

all decayed


I'm de only one left ob de Colony niggers;
How things do meander away!
When dey count my yeahs dey break down on de figgers,--
Fer things will meander away.
I was heah when Columbus discubbered Ohio;
I'm dyin' wid hunger today.
Lock me up in a pantry day's filled wid mince-pie--
Oh! how things would meander away.

Brudder Gabriel, blow! I am ready to go;
I am tired ob dis long delay.
You've de wicked to warn; better look for yer horn,--
Fer things will meander away.

I's as poor as de turkey dat Job was its owner;
How things do meander away!
I'm as sick as de whale when he landed up Jonar,--
Fer things will meander away.
I'm in debt for my day before yesterday's dinner,
An' can't find de cash fer to pay:
In dat Savin's Band game some one else was de winner,--
Fer things will meander away.

I'm a gnarly ole tree, wid a hurricane fightin';
How things do meander away!
All de limbs are torn off, an' de leabes gone akittin',--
Fer things will meander away.
Send me home for repairs when de hurricane ceases;
Remember de words dat I say!
Tie me up in a bag, an' don't stop for de pieces,--
Fer things will meander away.

Had my right eye knocked out by a word dat I hollered;
How things do meander away!
Called a white man a fool, an' an axerdent follered,--
Fer things will meander away.
Den a railroad collusion run ober some cattle,
An' one ob my limbs went astray;
An' anudder I left on de cornfield ob battle,--
Fer things will meander away.

Nitro-glycerum cans are not safe to unsodder;
How things do meander away!
An' wid circular saws 'tisn't wise fer to bodder,--
Fer things will meander away.
Dis ere top-lock was lifted by red Injun debils;
'Twas den de black wool become gray;
An' my last wooder leg was shot off by de rebels,--
For things will meander away.

Nicodemus, my son-in-law, long ago started;
How things do meander away!
An' dey say, from de gum-tree his bones hab departed,--
Fer things will meander away.
He will nebber come back, let me tell ye--no, nebber!
To pick up his burden of clay:
Gib a mud-turtle wings an' a free pass forebber,--
Ob course he'll meander away. 

Utopia is a place where you can find pure air
A place where everyone is kind, polite and fair
A place where there are Angels flying everywhere
A place where there is neither sadness nor despair.

In Utopia unique humans are not so rare
They all love each other and for emotions care
No envy, lying or hypocrisy - I swear
Everything and everyone's ideal I'm aware

I really really wish I really could be there 
But going to Utopia's a big affair.

Solid ground beneath your feet.

The only roads are those that offer access.

Bushes bend beneath the weight of proofs.

The Tree of Valid Supposition grows here
with branches disentangled since time immermorial.

The Tree of Understanding, dazzling straight and simple.
sprouts by the spring called Now I Get It.

The thicker the woods, the vaster the vista:
the Valley of Obviously.

If any doubts arise, the wind dispels them instantly.

Echoes stir unsummoned
and eagerly explain all the secrets of the worlds.

On the right a cave where Meaning lies.

On the left the Lake of Deep Conviction.
Truth breaks from the bottom and bobs to the surface.

Unshakable Confidence towers over the valley.
Its peak offers an excellent view of the Essence of Things.

For all its charms, the island is uninhabited,
and the faint footprints scattered on its beaches
turn without exception to the sea.

As if all you can do here is leave
and plunge, never to return, into the depths.


Into unfathomable life. 

A citizen confides to his Doctor: 
A demon inhabits my space: his clawed feet
jab my back, his arms encircle my neck 
and choke me for hours each day. Very often, 
he presses my eyelids tightly shut, 
and whispers hoarsely in my left ear, 
'You'll never see colors again.'
Can you help me, Doctor? Can you restore
me to the standards of the community? 
Doctor's note: Patient's inner life out of control.

A citizen confides to his private journal: 
The judge in my case was merciful, but
only partially merciful. He reduced the fine
for my embezzlement scheme, and did not
completely drain my credit account. 'Your children
are my primary concern, they must not suffer
for the father's crime. I will not preside over
their loss of food and shelter. You will not
be jailed. Pay your fine immediately. Dismissed! '
Of course, the judge is wealthy and I am poor.

A citizen reports to the Academic Supervisory Board: 
Agents from Control Central extol learning. Unfailingly, 
they guide us to that single book which will answer
our questions, or, at very least, will ease our doubts, 
or, even more basically, dispel that restlessness
of mind that clouds our judgment and complicates
obedience. The agents remind us that no learning, 
however alluring to our dazzled and dazed minds, 
should be permitted to interfere with that mental
emptiness necessary for a good night's sleep.

A citizen shares what he knows to be essential
to the Good Life with his seven children: 
'Sleep is sweet, ' intones the Rally Master.
'But chanting our beliefs, all of us reciting
from the same page, is sweeter.' And then he pauses, 
in the center of a hub where eight streets angle
into that hub, so that no action is occluded 
in shadows, but every act, even the tiniest gesture, 
is perfectly obvious. And then, dear children, 
your will chant for hours until everyone is ONE.

The Rally confirms the public will at the center
of our system. People arrive at their respective hubs
keen to begin the chanting. Families blend their members
together, elderly are guided to benches, babies receive
pampering from volunteers. Adolescents, acutely aware
their brains are on fire with gender changes, sigh
in relief as the chanting eases their inner turmoil.
Oh, that blessed state of mental emptiness will soon
spread through the hub and fully possess each citizen, 
regardless of age, gender, employment, obedience status.

Two speakers are always scheduled, of course, one before
the chanting, the other after. This is the inherited 
wisdom of our community: the first speaker empties 
our minds, the second one seals that emptiness. 
Dear children, a wise man, Kenneth Boulding, said 
many decades ago, 'Once humanity wises up, 
we can only hope it never dumbs down.' Oh, yes, 
you laugh because it sounds funny. Go ahead, laugh, 
because we have achieved perfection in our time, 
and we know with full confidence, Utopia Is Everywhere Today

Still in their dens
Living in the past
There were no divisions
In the subconscious

Political spiritual
Civil society talks of politics
Economics
Psychology
Science
Current issues

And the face book
Rise of nationalities

Iron fences are deeper
Than any spirit

The state is very powerful entity
For a global vision

The model is changing albeit
Materialism and sensuality
Step into the future
Into the next phase
Of the history of civilization

Islamabad
That got struck by the natural disaster, 
Teared apart the joyous trip of innocents, 
And devastated the families of many! 
Rains continued pouring and instead of being a boon, 
Acted as a goon, 
Killing many innocent lives and 
Hampering the religious sentiments of devotees! 
Army Men however proved to be the Real Heroes
Nurturing the needs and safety of helpless victims 
Dutifully serving and rescuing stranded people at the need of the hour

The darkness of spirals is consuming me still.
Why does this life spin me into more strife? 
Endless circles flowing from my cursed quill, 
And the quill truly made sharp with penknife.

Again, I feel black without and within.
It fills my mind with such miserable dreams, 
My heart flows, a thick and crimson bloodstream, 
My final breath is cried out, a sharp scream.

No light escapes my prison of twilight.
My shackles are fetters of sunless gloom.
I only wish for a glimpse of starlight, 
But I am imprisoned here in my dark tomb, 

This swirling black sea is so wintery.
The spirals are darkness that curses me. 

Years pass.
Cattle cars in the downtown freightyard
squeal and groan, and sizzling grills
steam the Barelas Coffee House cafe windows,
as the railroad workers with tin hard hats 
stop for coffee, hours of dawn
softly click on grandfather's gold pocket watches
in Louey's Broadway Pawnshop, hocked
to get a cousin or brother out of jail
City workers' tin carts and long-handled dust pans
clatter in curb gutters
as buses spew smoldering exhaust as they stop beneath
Walgreen's neon liquor sign.
I lean against an office building brick wall,
nothing to do, no where to go,
comb my hair in the blue tinted office windows,
see my reflection in the glinting chromed cars,
on a corner, beneath a smoking red traffic light,
I live-
blue beanie cap snug over my ears
down to my brow,
in wide bottomed jean pants trimmed with red braid,
I start my daily walk, 
to the Old Town Post Office,
condemned Armijo school building,
Rio Grande playa,
ditches and underpasses-
de-tribalized Apache
entangled in the rusty barbwire of a society I do not understand,
Mejicano blood in me spattering like runoff water
from a roof canale, glistening over the lives 
who lived before me, like rain over mounds of broken pottery,
each day backfills with brown dirt of my dreams.

I lived in the streets,
slept at friends' houses, spooned
pozole and wiped up the last frijoles with tortilla
from my plate. Each day
my hands hurt for something to have,
and a voice in me yearned to sing,
and my body wanted to shed the gray skin of streets,
like a snake that grew wings-
I wished I had had a chance to be a little boy,
and wished a girl had loved me,
and wished I had a family-but these 
were silver inlaid pieces of another man's life,
whose destiny fountained over stones and ivy
of the courtyard in a fairytale.

Each night I could hear the silver whittling blade
of La Llorona, 
carving a small child on the muddy river bottom,
like a little angel carved into ancient church doors.
on La Vega road, mounted on a white charger,
his black robe flapping in the moonlight 
as he thrashed through bosque brush.
Sometimes Wallei, the voice of water, sang to me,
and Mectallá, who lives in the fire, flew in the air,
and Cuzal, the Reader of Rocks, spoke with a voice
jagged as my street-fighting knuckles.

A voice in me soft as linen
unfolded on midnight air,
to wipe my loneliness away-the voice blew open
like a white handkerchief in the night
embroidered with red roses,
waving and waving from a dark window
at some lover who never returned.

I became a friend of the old women 
who hung out by the bars
on Central,Isleta,and Barcelona,
blue tear drops tattooed on their cheeks,
initials of ex-lovers on their hands,
women drawn out from the dark piss-stinking rooms
they lived in,
by the powerful force of the moon,
whose yellow teeth tore the alfalfa out of their hearts,
and left them stubbled,
parched grounds old goats of tecatos and winos
nibbled.


All my life the constant sound of someone's bootheels
trail behind me-thin, hard,
sharp sounds scraping frozen ground,
like a shovel digging a grave,
It's my guardian, following me through the broken branches
of the bosque, to the door
of the Good Shepherd Home on south d street,
for a hot meal. 


You are so serious, as if
a glacier spoke in your ear
or you had to walk through
the great gate of Kiev
to get to the living room.

I worry about this because I
love you. As if it weren't grotesque
enough that we live in hydrogen
and breathe like atomizers, you
have to think I'm a great architect!

and you float regally by on your
Thinking it a steam shovel. Looking
a little uneasy. But you are yourself
again, yanking silver beads off your neck.

Remember, the Russian Easter Overture
is full of bunnies. Be always high,
full of regard and honor and lanolin. Oh
ride horseback in pink linen, be happy!
and ride with your beads on, because it rains. 


Tufts, follicles, grubstake
biennial rosettes, a low-
life beach-blond scruff of
couch grass: notwithstanding
the interglinting dregs

of wholesale upheaval and
dismemberment, weeds do not
hesitate, the wheeling
rise of the ailanthus halts
at nothing—and look! here's

a pokeweed, sprung up from seed
dropped by some vagrant, that's
seized a foothold: a magenta-
girdered bower, gazebo twirls
of blossom rounding into

raw-buttoned, garnet-rodded
fruit one more wayfarer
perhaps may salvage from
the season's frittering,
the annual wreckage. 


Here in this isle
The summer still lingers,
And Autumn's brown fingers
So busy the while
With the leaves in the north;
Are scarcely put forth
In this land where the sun still glows like an ember,.
In mid-November.

In England it's cold,
And the yellow and red
Of October have fled ;
And the sun is wet gold
Like an emperor weeping,
When Death goes a-reaping
All through his empire, merciless comer
The dead things of summer.

The sky has cried so
That the earth is all sodden,
With dead leaves in-trodden,
And the trees to and fro
Wave their arms in the air
In despair, in despair :
They are thinking of all the hot days that are over,
And the cows in the clover.

Here the roses are out,
And the sun at high noon
Makes the birds faint and swoon.
But the cricket's about
With his song, and the hum
Of the bees as they come
To feast at the honey-board laden and groaning,
Makes musical droning.

But vainly, alas !
Do I hide in the south,
Kiss close with my mouth
Red flowers, green grass,
For Autumn has found me
And thrown her arms around me.
She has breathed on my lips and I wander apart,
Dead leaves in my heart. 


Have you ever felt incessant pain
As if the blood coming out of slit vein
Refusing to stop untill you faint
Like a never ending river
deforming the rocks with the dent.
 
They say, no pain no gain
I wonder what will happen, 
if everything I do goes in vain.

Some people say life is like this 
I guess they have got everything with ease
Its very easy to say
but far more difficult when you go out and play. 


Lady, lovely lady,
Careless and gay!
Once when a beggar called
She gave her child away.

The beggar took the baby,
Wrapped it in a shawl,
'Bring her back,' the lady said,
'Next time you call.'

Hard by lived a vain man,
So vain and so proud,
He walked on stilts
To be seen by the crowd.

Up above the chimney pots,
Tall as a mast,
And all the people ran about
Shouting till he passed.

'A splendid match surely,'
Neighbours saw it plain,
'Although she is so careless,
Although he is so vain.'

But the lady played bobcherry,
Did not see or care,
As the vain man went by her
Aloft in the air.

This gentle-born couple
Lived and died apart.
Water will not mix with oil,
Nor vain with careless heart. 


Iron-toothed Vajra-danshtra then arose in wrath and pride,
And his blood-stained mace of battle held in fury by his side,

'Wherefore, Ravan, waste thy forces on the foemen poor and vile,
Hermit Rama and his brother, Hanuman of impious wile,

Bid me,-with this mace of battle proud Sugriva I will slay,
Chase the helpless hermit brothers to the forests far away!

Or to deeper counsel listen! Varied shapes the Rakshas wear,
Let them wearing human visage. dressed as Bharat's troops appear,

Succour from his ruling brother Rama will in gladness greet,
Then with mace and blood-stained sabre we shall lay them at our feet,

Rock and javelin and arrow we shall on our foemen hail,
Till no poor surviving Vanar lives to tell the tragic tale!


'Stretched so thin my body can become a new type of glass.
So clear and transparent, so obedient to another's whim.
Watch it fold, watch it bend, watch it frizzle and crack and fray.
My head and my heart, just falling and crumbling into disarray. 

I'll tell myself to be strong, but even then my voice has no breath.
Every breath I try to take will seem to choke me, like it's running on a different kind of air. 


This valentine's, 
I wanted to sunrise you, 
so, I reserved a table just for two, 
so that I could be alone with you, 

Eager and burning with desire, 
I went ahead & ordered the most expensive wine, 
in a chic little French restaurant, 
where we were going to dine, 

Finally, I got you, 
a beautiful array of roses, 
just so that you could keep as a souvenir, 
I even got the musician there, 
to play us a special love song, 
as we'd dance all night away, 
I figured you would be exhausted, 
at the end of the day, 
so, I decided to give you a treat, 
two days stay in a luxurious hotel suite, 
and booked us a room for two! 

In my mind I didn't mind, 
after all, it was money well spent, 
because it was all for you, 
so when all this was finally done, 
I got my phone, 
rang you, but you couldn't hear the tone, 
because, it was switched off, 
you were on a date with someone else! 

So, I guess I'll be spending valentine's all alone
because i was too late

Too high, too high to pluck 
My heart shall swing. 
A fruit no bee shall suck, 
No wasp shall sting.

If on some night of cold 
It falls to ground 
In apple-leaves of gold 
I'll wrap it round.

And I shall seal it up 
With spice and salt, 
In a carven silver cup, 
In a deep vault.

Before my eyes are blind 
And my lips mute, 
I must eat core and rind 
Of that same fruit.

Before my heart is dust 
By the end of all, 
Eat it I must, I must 
Were it bitter gall.

But I shall keep it sweet 
By some strange art; 
Wild honey I shall eat 
When I eat my heart.

O honey cool and chaste 
As clover's breath! 
Sweet Heaven I shall taste 
Before my death. 


If my Valentine you won't be,

Not a red rose or a satin heart.

I give you an onion.
It is a moon wrapped in brown paper.
It promises light
like the careful undressing of love.

Here. 
It will blind you with tears 
like a lover.
It will make your reflection
a wobbling photo of grief.

I am trying to be truthful.

Not a cute card or a kissogram.

I give you an onion.
Its fierce kiss will stay on your lips,
possessive and faithful
as we are,
for as long as we are.

Take it.
Its platinum loops shrink to a wedding-ring,
if you like.

Lethal.
Its scent will cling to your fingers,
cling to your knife. 


Valentine angel spreads
the love and romance, 
A time for couples to 
share their love.

Bouquet of red roses to 
give to that special
someone, 
A box of heart chocolates
gives a taste of pleasure.

Valentine angel watches
from above, 
Proud of the love that
fills the air.

Valentine rings placed
upon a finger, 
This is surely a special
time for many couples.

Valentine angel gives a sigh, 
Happy to see what a lovely
day this has been.

Couples are happy in love, 
Hearts are filled with 
happy emotions.

Valentine angel says, 
'Now I must be on my way
until next Valentine's Day.'
Knowing there is plenty of 
love to go around for 
everyone. 


The Valentine day is near, 
For those to express their unexpressed love the day is here; 
This time just go for it my dear, 
And for the consequences do not fear! 

There are various ways to express love, 
From roses, cards, to love letters from dove; 
Huge profits do the shopkeepers who sell these earn, 
And with a big grin the hidden secrets of lovers they learn! 

East or West, Honey.  

you are the best, 
The lovers goodwill is put on a test; 
Those who pass this is in Cloud nine, 
And those who don't, wait for next Valentine day, is that fine? 

Setting aside jokes, 
Here's an ardent wish for all my reader folks; 
May every day seem like Valentine day, 
And lets make our life happy in every way

You can't order a poem like you order a taco.
Walk up to the counter, say, "I'll take two"
and expect it to be handed back to you
on a shiny plate.
 
Still, I like your spirit.
Anyone who says, "Here's my address,
write me a poem," deserves something in reply.
So I'll tell a secret instead:
poems hide. In the bottoms of our shoes,
they are sleeping. They are the shadows
drifting across our ceilings the moment 
before we wake up. What we have to do
is live in a way that lets us find them.
 
Once I knew a man who gave his wife
two skunks for a valentine.
He couldn't understand why she was crying.
"I thought they had such beautiful eyes


And he was serious. He was a serious man
who lived in a serious way. Nothing was ugly
just because the world said so. He really
liked those skunks. So, he re-invented them
as valentines and they became beautiful.
At least, to him. And the poems that had been hiding
in the eyes of skunks for centuries 
crawled out and curled up at his feet.
 
Maybe if we re-invent whatever our lives give us
we find poems. Check your garage, the off sock
in your drawer, the person you almost like, but not quite.
And let me know. 

Oh! I wish I were a tiny browny bird from out the south,
Settled among the alder-holts, and twittering by the stream;
I would put my tiny tail down, and put up my tiny mouth,
And sing my tiny life away in one melodious dream.

I would sing about the blossoms, and the sunshine and the sky,
And the tiny wife I mean to have in such a cosy nest;
And if some one came and shot me dead, why then I could but die,
With my tiny life and tiny song just ended at their best. 

Attention people.
Valentine's Day Bonanza.

Here I am where I never wanted to be, 
On the edge of the mountain, 
In the depths of the sea, 
Baring all that I ever had, 
Removing the cloak that I wore, 
Going back on the words I swore, 
The hood drops from my head
On the floor, my eyes closed
I can feel your mind caress me
Your eyes upon my skin, 
I am baring it all baring it all.

As I stand naked in front of you, 
Like the sun you shine, rain you pour, 
Maybe I did not have to show you, 
What I am made of, now I am a putty
In your hands, but the day I let
You love me darling
I bared it all, bared it all
Like the love pure
On this valentine day



My love, but before I want to kiss you
I want to feel your youth and softness
I want to feel the wet soft skin
To lay you down
And then and then and then
You twist like a climber to a tree
Convulse, moan as I kiss you deep
And again and again and again
I love you
As you stand in front of me
When in the sultry afternoon
I feast my eyes with the line
That puts you together and my hands
As I sculpt you
The long thin legs with the curve
The back like hanging on your slim spine
As I touch the richness of your thighs
As you melt slowly on the edge
And your belly as my fingers move down
The line as you part your legs
The skin as my hands touch
When you push up like tsunami
 



Valentines come
Valentines go
But the roses
Sweets and treats
 remain the same! 

Measure not my love
with roses and gifts, 
songs and praises, 
with minutes and hours
with diamonds and gold, 
but darling measure my love
with the tender words
i wrote for you in the 
endless nights, 
the prayers that 
i prayed in every temple, 
measure my love like a mother
to a child, without boundaries, 
with the laughter we laughed, 
and the warmth we spread, 
love that we shared
and gave it to others, 
but surely, measure my love
with the life that we gave
to love itself, yours and mine. 


The Sea-king woke from the troubled sleep
Of a vision-haunted night,
And he look'd from his bark o'er the gloomy deep,
And counted the streaks of light;
For the red sun's earliest ray
Was to rouse his bands that day,
To the stormy joy of fight!

But the dreams of rest were still on earth,
And the silent stars on high,
And there wav'd not the smoke of one cabin-hearth
'Midst the quiet of the sky;
And along the twilight bay
In their sleep the hamlets lay,
For they knew not the Norse were nigh!

The Sea-king look'd o'er the brooding wave:
He turn'd to the dusky shore,
And there seem'd, through the arch of a tide-worn cave,
A gleam, as of snow, to pour;
And forth, in watery light,
Mov'd phantoms, dimly white,
Which the garb of woman bore.

Slowly they mov'd to the billow side;
And the forms, as they grew more clear,
Seem'd each on a tall pale steed to ride,
And a shadowy crest to rear,
And to beckon with faint hand
From the dark and rocky strand,
And to point a gleaming spear.

Then a stillness on his spirit fell,
Before th' unearthly train,
For he knew Valhalla's daughters well,
The choosers of the slain!
And a sudden rising breeze
Bore across the moaning seas
To his ear their thrilling strain:

'There are songs in Odin's Hall,
For the brave, ere night to fall!
Doth the great sun hide his ray?-
He must bring a wrathful day!
Sleeps the falchion in its sheath?-
Swords must do the work of death!
Regner!-sea-king!-thee we call!
There is joy in Odin's Hall.

'At the feast and in the song,
Thou shalt be remember'd long!
By the green isles of the flood
Thou hast left thy track in blood!
On the earth and on the sea,
There are those will speak of thee!
'Tis enough-the war-gods call-
There is mead in Odin's Hall!

'Regner! tell thy fair-hair'd bride
She must slumber at thy side!
Tell the brother of thy breast
Ev'n for him thy grave hath rest!
Tell the raven-steed which bore thee,
When the wild wolf fled before thee,
He too with his lord must fall-
There is room in Odin's Hall!

'Lo! the mighty sun looks forth-
Arm! thou leader of the north!
Lo! the mists of twilight fly-
We must vanish, thou must die!
By the sword and by the spear,
By the hand that knows not fear,
Sea-king! nobly shalt thou fall!-
There is joy in Odin's Hall!'


There was arming heard on land and wave,
When afar the sunlight spread,
And the phantom forms of the tide-worn cave
With the mists of morning fled.
But at eve, the kingly hand
Of the battle-axe and brand,
Lay cold on a pile of dead

My candle burned alone in an immense valley.
Beams of the huge night converged upon it,
Until the wind blew.
The beams of the huge night
Converged upon its image,
Until the wind blew. 


Foremost midst the gathered Sages to the holy yajna came
Deathless Bard of Lay Immortal-Saint Valmiki rich in fame,

Midst the humble homes of rishis, on the confines of the wood,
Cottage of the Saint Valmiki in the shady garden stood.

Fruits and berries from the jungle, water from the crystal spring,
With a careful hand Valmiki did unto his cottage bring,

And he spake to gentle Lava, Kusa child of righteous fame,
Sita's sons, as youthful hermits to the sacred feast they came:

Lift your voices, righteous pupils, and your richest music lend,
Sing the Lay of Ramayana from the first unto the end,

Sing it to the holy Brahman, to the warrior fair and tall,
In the crowded street and pathway, in the monarch's palace hall,

Sing it by the door of Rama,-he ordains this mighty feast,
Sing it to the royal ladies,-they shall to the story list,

Sing from day to day unwearied, in this sacrificial site,
Chant to all the gathered nations Rama's deeds of matchless might,

And this store of fruits and berries will allay your thirst and toil,
Gentle children of the forest, unknown strangers in this soil!

Twenty cantos of the Epic, morn to night, recite each day,
Till from end to end is chanted Ramayana's deathless Lay,

Ask no alms, receive no riches, nor of your misfortunes tell,
Useless unto us is bounty who in darksome forests dwell,

Children of the wood and mountain, cruel fortune clouds your birth,
Stainless virtue be your shelter, virtue be your wealth on earth!

If the royal Rama questions and your lineage seeks to know,
Say,-Valmiki is our Teacher and our Sire on earth below,

Wake your harps to notes of rapture and your softest accents lend,
With the music of the poet music of your voices blend,

Bow unto the mighty monarch, bow to Rama fair and tall,
He is father of his subjects, he is lord of creatures all!


'What worth it is of
a diamond hill in Jupiter? 
Who cares a jumbo golden pearl
fossilized in Satan’s dark abyss? 
What earthly use of a rainbow
Bridging an oceanic chasm? 
What value is of a tear, 
human eye never let out and shed


I watched people work hard for cash
Making $dollars a day
With only cent bags of chips
And lil huggies reaching their mouths
Some consider a meal
Less fortunate consider it luxury
It's taxing for a young heart to see
These same people told me I can be
Anything in this world, but day after day
These same men and women 
Were nothing more than worldly possessions
Spending their whole lives to get out of debt they inherited
I wasn't born rich, but I want to die wealthy
And my wealth doesn't involve shiny beads and paper
It's living and loving life, and reducing labor


Pass by citizen
don't look left or right
Keep those drip dry eyes straight ahead
A tree? Chop it down- it's a danger
to lightning!
Pansies calling for water,
Let 'em die- queer bastards-
Seek comfort in the scarlet, labour
saving plastic rose
Fresh with the frangrance of Daz!
Sunday! Pray citizen;
Pray no rain will fall
On your newly polished
Four wheeled


Envoi

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Get it out with Optrex


The metalic taste of blood, 
drips off my very tongue.
Your flesh so bittersweet, 
tastes like honey-coated meat.

Into the mirror's gaze, 
I look beyond the glass.
I see no future, 
For I have no past.

There is no reflection, 
to be heard and seen.
For a creature of the night, 
I have always been. 


On hands their praise, of sounds that made
Tantrums thrown upon the keyboard, the maid
Rush to her master, little, a toddler
Twisting the house of Van Dudler on his little finger

Outside the windows, behind curtains
Made of silk; with an innocent pretence
Stood the maid's son from her dead husband
A darling little creature, they called him Donovan

His yellow curls fell around his ears as they perched
And listened to the sounds filtering as he lurched
Deep down, and asked his butterflies to rest, 
Slowly he inched his way to put his skills to test

His fingers ran like a river down the lane
A sound so melodic, the sweet of sugar cane
The maid's son was poor but his music was not
As fingers touched ivory in not a brighter note

Van Dudler mused at the sound from his house
The toddler had dreamed, so had his spouse
The maid was alarmed that her son was the one
Off she went, and there he was shunned

A scar left the face where the hand fell to seize
The art of his music from her master's ancient piece, 
His face was so flushed but hers even more, 
Maid Martha was red as she profusely swore.


'Ay, why would you stop little boy, play on'
Said van Dudler, and he wasn't alone
The whole house was down to lend their ears
For a music played beyond a boy's tender years

Maid Martha's son played his tune of old blue
And his audience amazed, their ears stick like glue
At the notes that soothed the troublesome toddler
And filled the house of good old Van Dudler


Where am I to find your soul
Oh, Vancouver, where are you? 

In your magnificent parks
Downtown symmetry of beautiful roads
Speeding sky-trains sliding smooth
North, south east and west
On sky-rise mansions that shine back the sun? 

Where are you? 

I missed you wherever I looked
Like the elusive maple
Hard to spot in your famous parks
Just dry leaves here and there
Then on paper
Proud image of State power.

Vancouver, where are you? 

The grey of the sky, rain-soaked wet
Bite of chilly winds from west
Had no answer to offer
Neither did cherry-blossoms
That rain splendour on the roads
And passers-by
So profusely

Vancouver, where am I to find your soul? 

I looked for you in the shine
Of lovers’ eyes in embrace, in vain, 
In walkers who throw gentle smiles
On passers-by, yet aloof by miles
In the childlike demeanour of the aged
Meandering your parks their past packaged


I asked the firs, acacia, pines
Cypress, magnolia, evergreens
Giant dogwoods fast asleep
Thoughtful spruces, cedars alike
They offered a pre-spring yawn
Clad still smug in winter yarns

Silent, cold was Seymour Creek
Mist on Fraser did not speak
Ice-capped peaks on north and south
Neither had a word to mouth
Nothing on the landscape revealed
Where Vancouver remained concealed

Where am I to find your soul? 
Oh, Vancouver, where are you? 

At last as I emplane home, 
I am beckoned from the groves
By you, Vancouver, there you are
In the sprouts that dot the barks -
Budding foliage - spring  embarks! 

You are the one soul that sustains
Winter’s silence, mirth of spring
Like sleep and wake in single chain
In me, Oh, we never are twain
Sad I missed you so many times!"



'I've found the secret of your charm,' I said,
Expounding with complacency my guess.
Alas! the charm, even as I named it, fled,
For all its secret was unconsciousness. 


The fleet astronomer can bore 
And thread the spheres with his quick-piercing mind: 
He views theirs stations, walks from door to door, 
Surveys, as if he had designed 
To make a purchase there: he sees their dances, 
And knoweth long before, 
Both their full-eyed aspects, and secret glances. 

The nimble diver with his side 
Cuts through the working waves, that he may fetch 
On purpose from the ventrous wretch; 
That he might save his life, and also hers, 
Who with excessive pride 
Her own destruction and his danger wears. 

The subtle chymick can devest 
And strip the creature naked, till he find 
The callow principles within their nest: 
There he imparts to them his mind, 
Admitted to their bed-chamber, before 
They appear trim and drest 
To ordinary suitors at the door. 

What hath not man sought out and found, 
Embosoms in us, mellowing the ground 
With showers and frosts, with love and awe, 
So that we need not say, Where's this command? 
Poor man, thou searchest round 
To find out death, but missest life at hand. 


As he said vanity, so vain say I, 
Oh! Vanity, O vain all under sky; 
Where is the man can say, "Lo, I have found 
On brittle earth a consolation sound"? 
What isn't in honor to be set on high? 
No, they like beasts and sons of men shall die, 
And whilst they live, how oft doth turn their fate; 
He's now a captive that was king of late. 
What isn't in wealth great treasures to obtain? 
No, that's but labor, anxious care, and pain. 
He heaps up riches, and he heaps up sorrow, 
It's his today, but who's his heir tomorrow? 
What then? Content in pleasures canst thou find? 
More vain than all, that's but to grasp the wind. 
The sensual senses for a time they pleasure, 
Meanwhile the conscience rage, who shall appease? 
What isn't in beauty? No that's but a snare, 
They're foul enough today, that once were fair. 
What is't in flow'ring youth, or manly age? 
The first is prone to vice, the last to rage. 
Where is it then, in wisdom, learning, arts? 
Sure if on earth, it must be in those parts; 
Yet these the wisest man of men did find 
But vanity, vexation of the mind. 
And he that know the most doth still bemoan 
He knows not all that here is to be known. 
What is it then? To do as stoics tell, 
Nor laugh, nor weep, let things go ill or well? 
Such stoics are but stocks, such teaching vain, 
While man is man, he shall have ease or pain. 
If not in honor, beauty, age, nor treasure, 
Nor yet in learning, wisdom, youth, nor pleasure, 
Where shall I climb, sound, seek, search, or find 
That summum bonum which may stay my mind? 
There is a path no vulture's eye hath seen, 
Where lion fierce, nor lion's whelps have been, 
Which leads unto that living crystal fount, 
Who drinks thereof, the world doth naught account. 
The depth and sea have said " 'tis not in me," 
With pearl and gold it shall not valued be. 
For sapphire, onyx, topaz who would change; 
It's hid from eyes of men, they count it strange. 
Death and destruction the fame hath heard, 
But where and what it is, from heaven's declared; 
It brings to honor which shall ne'er decay, 
It stores with wealth which time can't wear away. 
It yieldeth pleasures far beyond conceit, 
And truly beautifies without deceit. 
Nor strength, nor wisdom, nor fresh youth shall fade, 
Nor death shall see, but are immortal made. 
This pearl of price, this tree of life, this spring, 
Who is possessed of shall reign a king. 
Nor change of state nor cares shall ever see, 
But wear his crown unto eternity. 
This satiates the soul, this stays the mind, 
And all the rest, but vanity we find. 


The evils that beset our path
Who can prevent or cure?
We stand upon the brink of death
When most we seem secure. 

If we today sweet peace possess,
It soon may be withdrawn;
Some change may plunge us in distress,
Before tomorrow's dawn. 

Disease and pain invade our health
And find an easy prey;
And oft, when least expected, wealth
Takes wings and flies away. 

A fever or a blow can shake
Our wisdom's boasted rule;
And of the brightest genius make
A madman or a fool. 

The gourds, from which we look for fruit,
Produce us only pain;
A worm unseen attacks the root,
And all our hopes are vain. 

I pity those who seek no more
Than such a world can give;
Wretched they are, and blind, and poor,
And dying while they live. 

Since sin has filled the earth with woe,
And creatures fade and die;
And fix our hopes on high. 


Honey though the bee prepares,
An envenomed sting he wears;
Piercing thorns a guard compose
Round the fragrant blooming rose. 

Where we think to find a sweet,
Oft a painful sting we meet:
When the rose invites our eye,
We forget the thorn is nigh. 

Why are thus our hopes beguiled?
Why are all our pleasures spoiled?
Why do agony and woe
From our choicest comforts grow? 

Sin has been the cause of all!
'Twas not thus before the fall:
What but pain, and thorn, and sting,
From the root of sin can spring? 

Now with every good we find
Vanity and grief entwined;
What we feel, or what we fear,
All our joys embitter here. 

Yet, through the Redeemer's love,
These afflictions blessings prove;
He the wounding stings and thorns,
Into healing med'cines turns. 

From the earth our hearts they wean,
Teach us on his arm to lean;
Urge us to a throne of grace,
Make us seek a resting place. 

In the mansions of our King
Sweets abound without a sting;
Thornless there the roses blow,
And the joys unmingled flow.


VANQUISHED

An uproar in my neighbour’s yard I heard, 
Which brought me scurrying out into my own.
A sad, unsightly sight it was that stirred
Before my eyes – in all its crudeness shown! 

I soon descried, amidst the pandemonium, 
A gallant horse with head lifted high, 
Incommoded by a bunch of hoodlums
Who tried, with whips, his pride to mortify.

Revolted he and kicked with violent wrath; 
Ululantly loud was heard his neighbouring: 
And from his mouth, exuded foaming froth, 
With ‘hey! s  and ho! s’ while beastly men were braying.

Mobbing him, all round, like bustling bees, 
With bridles, bits and reins in their possession, 
Trainers tried a sneaky chance to seize
To harness him, amidst a flogging session! 

Sanguineous streams soon started flowing
While scourges lashed the horse relentlessly! 
I saw, aghast, that bits of skin were blowing
Off, while humans sought ascendancy! 

No more could I withstand this grizzly scene
(Where man looked the beast and beast the man) : 
So back I went into my room to screen
My eyes against this horse-mastering clan.

But lingered, still, a morbid, mental picture
And thoughts that I would rather have forsaken: 
My restless mind started to conjecture
What turn the show, next, door, would have taken.

My neighbour’s new equine acquisition
Had looked to me Pegasus come alive -
For artists all a paying proposition, 
Their theme and inspiration to derive! 

This captive horse must have left behind
Hoof-prints of his boundless liberty -
Setting sail, in poets’ streaming minds, 
Ship-loads of prancing poetry! 

With flowing mane and trail’s flying tresses, 
Like wind he must have raced – fast and free! 
Now, here he is, entrapped in human meshes
For coaching in the art of slavery! 

Soon his broken will will be bridled; 
His freedom, soon, will find itself in chains; 
His princely pride, with cunning will be stifled; 
Unvanquished, not for long, he’ll remain.

Lost in gloomy thoughts and reflections, 
Lost was I to how much time I spent.
Now, apprehensively, for reinspection
Of my hooved hero, out I went.

The ungulate no more was ‘flying horse’: 
That all his pride lay in disarray
His lowered head and eyes did endorse: 
I saw him being meekly led away. 


The old watch: their
thick eyes
puff and foreclose by the moon. 

The young, heads
trailed by the beginnings of necks,
shiver,
in the guarantee they shall be bodies.

In the frog pond
the vapor trail of a SAC bomber creeps,

I hear its drone, drifting, high up
in immaculate ozone. 


COME to me, all ye that labour; I will give your spirits rest;
Here apart in starry quiet I will give you rest.
Come to me, ye heavy laden, sin defiled and care opprest,
In your father's quiet mansions, soon to prove a welcome guest.
But an hour you bear your trial, sin and suffer, bleed and die;
But an hour you toil and combat here in day's inspiring eye.
See the feet of your deliverer; lo, the hour of freedom nigh. 





Notably fond of music, I dote on a 
clearer tone 
Than ever was blared by a bugle or zoomed 
by a saxophone; 
And the sound that opens the gates for me of 
a Paradise revealed 
Is something akin to the note revered by the 
blessed Eugene Field, 
Who sang in pellucid phrasing that I perfectly 
will recall 
Of the clink of the ice in the pitcher that the 
boy brings up the hall. 
But sweeter to me than the sparrow's song or 
the goose's autumn honks 
Is the sound of the ice in the shaker as the 
barkeeper mixes a Bronx.

Between the dark and the daylight, when I'm 
worried about The Tower, 
Comes a pause in the day's tribulations that 
is known as the cocktail hour; 
And my soul is sad and jaded, and my heart 
is a thing forlorn, 
And I view the things I have written with a 
sickening, scathing scorn. 
Oh, it's then I fare with some other slave who 
is hired for the things he writes 
To a Den of Sin where they mingle gin--such 
as Lipton's, Mouquin's or Whyte's, 
And my spirit thrills to a music sweeter than 
Sullivan or Puccini-- 
The swash of the ice in the shaker as he mixes 
a Dry martini.

The drys will assert that metallic sound is the 
selfsame canon made 
By the ice in a shaker that holds a drink 
like orange or lemonade; 
But on the word of a traveled man and a 
bard who has been around, 
The sound of tin on ice and gin is a snappier, 
happier sound. 
And I mean to hymn, as soon as I have a 
moment of leisure time, 
The chill susurrus of cocktail ice in an adequae 
piece of rhyme. 
But I've just had an invitation to hark, at a 
beckoning bar, 
To the sound of the ice in the shaker as the 
barkeeper mixes a Star. 


A certain day became a presence to me;
there it was, confronting me--a sky, air, light:
a being. And before it started to descend
from the height of noon, it leaned over
and struck my shoulder as if with
the flat of a sword, granting me
honor and a task. The day's blow
rang out, metallic--or it was I, a bell awakened,
and what I heard was my whole self
saying and singing what it knew: I can. 


Five people at a club, 
One a compulsive drinker.
Sitting at the bar twenty four seven, 
Never moving form the seat, 
Never leaving save to draw money 
From the dwindling deposit.

Another nothing more then an avid party goer.
Obsessed with the music, 
Even more with the booze.
Hoping against hope
That there is something more to life.

Another sits on the periphery, 
Never drunk never sober.
A perfect mismatch.
Trying to fit in
But failing dismally.

The fourth a smoker. 
Living off life's beloved cancer stick.
Neither here nor there, 
Neither alive nor dead.
Fearing for the worst.

The last a gentle one.
Hoping to possess no one and nothingness. 
Perhaps one day we'll know the goodness
Of an unstained seed.

And so we live our lives. 
Never good never bad. 
Just on the edge of society.
Hoping to break in. 


It takes a lot of a person's life
To be French, or English, or American
Or Italian. And to be at any age. To live at any certain time.
The Polish-born resident of Manhattan is not merely a representative of
   general humanity
And neither is this Sicilian fisherman stringing his bait
Or to be any gender, born where or when
Betty holding a big plate
Karen crossing her post-World War Two legs
And smiling across the table
These three Italian boys age about twenty gesturing and talking
And laughing after they get off the train
Seem fifty percent Italian and the rest percent just plain
Human race.
O mystery of growing up! O history of going to school!
O lovers O enchantments!

The subject is not over because the photograph is over.
The photographer sits down. Murnau makes the movie.
Everything is a little bit off, but has a nationality.
The oysters won't help the refugees off the boats,
Only other human creatures will. The phone rings and the Albanian
   nationalist sits down.
When he gets up he hasn't become a Russian emigre or a German circus
   clown
A woman is carrying a basket—a beautiful sight! She is in and of
   Madagascar.
The uniformed Malay policeman sniffs the beer barrel that the brothers of
   Ludwig are bringing close to him.
All humanity likes to get drunk! Are differences then all on the surface?
But even every surface gets hot
In the sun. It may be that the surface is where we are all alike!
But man and woman show that this isn't true.
We will get by, though. The train is puffing at the station
But the station isn't puffing at the train. This difference allows for a sense
   of community
As when people feel really glad to have cats and dogs
And some even a few mice in the chimney. We are not alone
In the universe, and the diversity causes comfort as well as difficulty.
To be Italian takes at least half the day. To be Chinese seven-eighths of it.
Only at evening when Chang Ho, repast over, sits down to smoke
Is he exclusively human, in the way the train is exclusively itself when it is
   in motion
But that's to say it wrongly. His being human is also his being seven-eighths
   Chinese.
Falling in love one may get, say, twenty percent back
Toward universality, though that is probably all. Then when love's gone
One's Nigerianness increases, or one's quality of being of Nepal.
An American may start out wishing
To be everybody or that everybody were the same
Which makes him or her at least eighty percent American. Dixit Charles
   Peguy, circa 
Wouldn't go unnoticed


" Like the taste of wheat, sirrah! Or the Japanese.
So that someplace on earth there would be people who were
Writing haiku. But think of the human body with its arms
Its nose, its eyes, its brain often subject to alarms
Think how much energy, work, and time have gone into it,
To give us such a variegated kind of humanity!
It takes fifteen seconds this morning to be a man,
Twenty to be an old one, four to be an American,
Two to be a college graduate and four or five hours to write.
And what's more, I love you! half of every hour for weeks or months for
   this;
Nine hundred seconds to be an admirer of Italian Renaissance painting,
Sixteen hours to be someone awake.
One is recognizably American, male, and of a certain generation. Nothing
   takes these markers away.

Even if I live in Indonesia as a native in a hut, someone coming through
   there
Will certainly gasp and say Why you're an American!
My optimism, my openness, my lack of a sense of history,
My distinctive facial muscles ready to look angry or sad or sympathetic
In a moment and not quite know where to go from there;
My assuming that anything is possible, my deep sense of superiority
And inferiority at the same time; my lack of culture,
Except for the bookish kind; my way of acting with the dog, come here
All these and hundreds more declare me to be what I am.
It's burdensome but also inevitable. I think so.
Expatriates have had some success with the plastic surgery
Of absence and departure. But it is never absolute. And then they must bear
   the new identity as well.

Irish or Russian, the individuality in them is often mistaken for nationality.
The Russian finding a soul in the army officer, the Irishman finding in him
   someone with whom he can drink.
Consider the Volga boatman? One can only guess
But probably about ninety percent Russian, eighty percent man, and thirty
   percent boatman, Russian, man, and boatman,
A good person for the job, a Russian man of the river.
This dog is two-fifths wolf and less than one-thousandth a husband or 
   father.
Dogs resist nationality by being breeds. This one is simply Alsatian.
Though he may father forth a puppy
Who seems totally something else if for example he (the Alsatian) is attracted
To a poodle with powerful DNA. The puppy runs up to the Italian boys
   who smile
Thinking it would be fun to take it to Taormina
Where they work in the hotel and to teach it tricks.
A Frenchwoman marvels at this scene.
The woman bends down to the dog and speaks to it in French.
This is hopeful and funny. To the dog all human languages are a perfumed
   fog.
He wags and rises on his back legs. One Italian boy praises him, "Bravo!
   canino!"
Underneath there is the rumble of the metro train. The boy looks at the
   woman.
Life offers them these entangling moments as—who?—on a bicycle goes
   past.
It is a Congolese with the savannah on his shoulders
And the sky in his heart, but his words as he passes are in French—
"Bonjour, m'sieu dames," and goes speeding off with his identity,
His Congolese, millennial selfhood unchanging and changing place. 


The war is in words and the wood is the world
That turns beneath our rootless feet;
the vines that reach, alive and snarled,
Across the path where the sand is swirled,
Twist in the night. The light lies flat.
The war is in words and the wood is the world.

The rain is ruin and our ruin rides
The swiftest winds; the wood is whorled
And turned and smoothed by the turning tides.
--There is rain in the woods, slow rain that breeds
The war in the words. The wood is the world.
This rain is ruin and our ruin rides.

The war is in words and the wood is the world,
Sourceless and seized and forever filled
With green vine twisting on wood more gnarled
Than dead men's hands. The vines are curled
Around these branches, crushed and killed.
The war is in words and the wood is the world.

I chopped down the house that you had been saving to live in next summer.


	I am sorry, but it was morning, and I had nothing to do
and its wooden beams were so inviting.

    We laughed at the hollyhocks together
and then I sprayed them with lye.
Forgive me. I simply do not know what I am doing.

    I gave away the money that you had been saving to live on for the
                                                       next ten years.
The man who asked for it was shabby
and the firm March wind on the porch was so juicy and cold.

    Last evening we went dancing and I broke your leg.
Forgive me. I was clumsy and
I wanted you here in the wards, where I am the doctor


This is a word we use to plug
holes with. It's the right size for those warm
blanks in speech, for those red heart-
shaped vacancies on the page that look nothing
like real hearts. Add lace
and you can sell
it. We insert it also in the one empty
space on the printed form
that comes with no instructions. There are whole
magazines with not much in them
but the word love, you can
rub it all over your body and you
can cook with it too. How do we know
it isn't what goes on at the cool
debaucheries of slugs under damp
pieces of cardboard? As for the weed-
seedlings nosing their tough snouts up
among the lettuces, they shout it.
Love! Love! sing the soldiers, raising
their glittering knives in salute.


Then there's the two
of us. This word
is far too short for us, it has only
four letters, too sparse
to fill those deep bare
vacuums between the stars
that press on us with their deafness.
It's not love we don't wish
to fall into, but that fear.
this word is not enough but it will
have to do. It's a single
vowel in this metallic
silence, a mouth that says
O again and again in wonder
and pain, a breath, a finger
grip on a cliffside. You can
hold on or let go. 


Anger, done up its laces
and kicked out with iron boots.

Hate, sat on the fence, 
scheming its next cunning move.

Love, folded its arms, 
watched from a safe distance.

Lethargy, shrugged its shoulders. 

who cares anyway



There was a young vegan 
Called Steven,
Who just would not kill for no reason,
This kid would not eat
No cheese or no meat
And he hated the foxhunting season. 

Remember that vegan called Steven
Yes he would not kill for no reason,
Well I saw him today
Wearing nothing I say
But some cabbage leaves
With a few peas on. 

Fell asleep last night with the TV on,
Oh, what a dream I had.
Dreamed I went and answered ev'ry single
One of those late night mail order ads.
Then four to six weeks later,
Much to my surprise,
The mailman came to my front door
And I couldn't believe my eyes.


He brought the Vegematic
And the Pocket Fisherman, too,
Illuminated, illustrated History of Life
And Box Car Willie with a ginsu knife,
A bamboo steamer and a garden weasel, too,
And a tie dyed day-glow souvenir shirt
From Six Flags Over Burbank.

Well, the doorbell rang all mornin',
All through the afternoon,
And I shook with fright as it rang all night
By the light of the Mastercard moon.
There was Federal Express in the pantry,

Parcel Post in the hall,
COD to the ceiling,
And I just couldn't pay for it all.

I got an egg scrambler
With a seal-a-meal carryin' case,
A set of Presidential Commemorative Plates
So I could eat my eggs off a President's face,
A minute mender
And a needle that'll knit or crochet
And an autographed photograph of Rin Tin Tin
At Six Flags Over Burbank.

Well I know that I was dreamin'
So I gave a mighty cheer
When I awoke, it was no joke
'Cause all that shit was here,
So if you fall asleep with the TV on
Let me tell you what to do.
Rip the telephone out of the wall
Unless you want this to happen to you.

You get Vegematic and the Pocket Fisherman, too,
Iluminated, illustrated History of Life
And Box Car Willie with a ginsu knife,
A bamboo steamer and a garden weasel, too,
And a tie dyed day-glow souvenir shirt
From Six Flags Over Burbank.


two smiles meet towards
the child-wheel of my zeal
the bloody baggage of creatures
made flesh in physical legends-lives

the nimble stags storms cloud over
rain falls under the scissors of
the dark hairdresser-furiously
swimming under the clashing arpeggios

in the machine's sap grass
grows around with sharp eyes
here the share of our caresses
dead and departed with the waves

gives itself up to the judgment of time
parted by the meridian of hairs
non strikes in our hands
the spices of human pleasures


Eat a tomato and you'll turn red
(I don't think that's really so);
Eat a carrot and you'll turn orange
(Still and all, you never know);
Eat some spinach and you'll turn green
(I'm not saying that it's true
But that's what I heard, and so
I thought I'd pass it on to you). 


O never harm the dreaming world, 
the world of green, the world of leaves, 
but let its million palms unfold 
the adoration of the trees.

It is a love in darkness wrought
obedient to the unseen sun,
longer than memory, a thought
deeper than the graves of time.

The turning spindles of the cells
weave a slow forest over space,
the dance of love, creation,
out of time moves not a leaf,
and out of summer, not a shade. 


I’ve never seen the interior of a vein nor an artery, in my body.
But I know what’s there babe, ‘cause I can feel my heart beat.
My heart pumps love through veins and arteries.
No lump can stop the flow! 
Though my love tank looks empty when it’s cold outside, 
My love runs like a river on the inside
Vasoconstriction cannot deter my fluency honey.
There’s no restriction of love in these tributaries.
Just like the U. 


S. military, I got a potent heart.
Every time I breathe in your elegant smell, my love energizes.
Every time I exhale, I desire more and more of you.
Your voice, your portrayal, your comeliness and your posture, goes straight into my aorta.
The last time I was bruised, I was amused by the amount of love that flowed out of my body.
But that’s just life sugar, some love just weren’t meant to be.
I depend on a love, I’m comprised of love, and my love’s o-positive babe.
I can give love to anyone, but I can only receive from you.
Adam knew Eve then they knew love.
Come feel my love vessels with your soft, smooth hands madam! 
And I’ll feel yours. 
Veins and arteries are of romance, 
While love makes you hug, kiss, sing and dance.
Babe, the love in me gives second chances.
The love we pursue need not disturbances.
Where do veins and arteries end my love? 
Our love will never end! 
Love me with the love in your veins and arteries, and I’ll love you just the same. 
Win me your love like lotteries. Ain’t no gamble! A lover’s game.
Bleed me your love babe! 
When you do shout out my name! 
Love was made for couples only.
Love me till we love again. 


I’m delighted by the velocity of money as it whistles through the windows 
of Lower East Side
Delighted by skyscrapers rising the old grungy apartments falling on 
h Street
Delighted by inflation that drives me out on the street
After all what good’s the family farm, why eat turkey by thousands every 
Thanksgiving?
Why not have Star Wars? Why have the same old America?!?
George Washington wasn’t good enough! Tom Paine pain in the neck, 
Whitman what a jerk!
I’m delighted by double digit interest rates in the Capitalist world
I always was a communist, now we’ll win
an usury makes the walls thinner, books thicker & dumber
my manuscripts worth their weight in useless gold -
Now everybody’s atheist like me, nothing’s sacred
buy and sell your grandmother, eat up old age homes,
Peddle babies on the street, pretty boys for sale on Times Square -
You can shoot heroin, I can sniff cocaine,
macho men can fite on the Nicaraguan border and get paid with paper!
The velocity’s what counts as the National Debt gets higher
Everybody running after the rising dollar
Crowds of joggers down broadway past City Hall on the way to the Fed
Nobody reads Dostoyevsky books so they’ll have to give a passing ear 
to my fragmented ravings in between President’s speeches 
Nothing’s happening but the collapse of the Economy
so I can go back to sleep till the landlord wins his eviction suit in court. 


There we played
Behind the rose bushes
At the beginning of time
Living a dream
Living dreams
 
All day long flickering our eyes
To a world that wasn't there
To a world that didn't care
About adults and cruelty
An innocent place
Where we could live out our dreams
Live a dream

 
There we knew the trees would never be bare
We could crawl along roads
Unmetaled by the drawbacks of worry
And hide behind walls
 
In the velvet paradise
Within our minds


Let us walk in the white snow 
In a soundless space; 
With footsteps quiet snd slow, 
At a tranquil pace, 
Under veils of white lace.

I shall go shod in silk, 
And you in wool, 
White as white cow's milk, 
More beautiful 
Than the breast of a gull.

We shall walk through the still town 
In a windless peace; 
We shall step upon white down, 
Upon silver fleece, 
Upon softer than these.

We shall walk in velvet shoes: 
Wherever we go 
Silence will fall like dews 
On white silence below. 
We shall walk in the snow.

Slides both white feet across the slanted beams 
Which lace the peacock jalousies: behold 
An idol of fine clay, with feet of gold


Windows pampered like princes always see
what on occasion deigns to trouble us:
the city that, time and again, where a shimmer
of sky strikes a feeling of floodtide,

takes shape without once choosing to be.
Each new morning must first show her the opals
she wore yesterday, and pull rows
of reflections out of the canal
and remind her of the other times:
only then does she concede and settle in

like a nymph who received great Zeus.
The dangling earrings ring out at her ear;
but she lifts San Giorgio Maggiore
and smiles idly into that lovely thing.




When I was young I longed for Love,
And held his glory far above
All other earthly things. I cried:
'Come, Love, dear Love, with me abide;'
And with my subtlest art I wooed,
And eagerly the wight pursued.
But Love was gay and Love was shy,
He laughed at me and passed me by.

Well, I grew old and I grew gray,
When Wealth came wending down my way.
I took his golden hand with glee,
And comrades from that day were we.
Then Love came back with doleful face,
And prayed that I would give him place.
But, though his eyes with tears were dim,
I turned my back and laughed at him. 


A two-faced man is more venomous 
Than the snake with two fangs. 

Bitten by a snake.
One can withdraw the venom.
Bitten by a man,
That's the end. 


Mercury: 
There's a woman on the rock behind you
She writes on walls when nobody's looking
She writes on walls for nobody's listening
She travels lightly in every direction
Perhaps you know this lonely creature? 

Venus: 
Indeed i know her, her loyalty's blinding
My name she honours like a sacred fountain
Her body trembles at the sound of thunder
But eyes stay open, savouring the lightning
Why enquire of this lovely creature? 

Mercury: 
I think I know her, I feel that she knows me
Strange perception, and not even frightening

Venus: 
She is dreaming of this conversation
Let her finish.  How are you this evening? 

Mercury: 
I am restless, yet tired, like a morning

Venus: 
Hold my hand, I have missed you gravely


I am the verb and she my adverb; 
Qualifies and quantifies my moves, movements, stirrings and doings; 
I am the action and she is its description and style; 

Endearingly she showers love and affection
Inspiring me to compose and create; 

Daringly I enjoy her every bit, moment and thing, 
In our intimate moments to the hilt blissfully; 

She is the cheque and I am her encasher; 
She is the check on my emotions, actions, reactions and interactions; 

Lovingly she obliges and cooperates in the exhilarating union of our hearts and bodies; 

Also I am noun and she is my adjective; 
Qualifies and quantifies me and my existence; 

We are parts of speech, grammar, vocabulary and sense
In the language of our love and intimacy; 

We are eternal and one as the word and its meaning 
And are related as verb and adverb; 

 I am the flow she is the speed
I am the glow and she is the light




As long as the woman from Rijksmuseum
in painted silence and concentration
day after day pours milk
from the jug to the bowl,
the World does not deserve
the end of the world. 


Pierre Bonnard would enter
the museum with a tube of paint
in his pocket and a sable brush.
Then violating the sanctity
of one of his own frames
he'd add a stroke of vermilion
to the skin of a flower.
Just so I stopped you
at the door this morning
and licking my index finger, removed
an invisible crumb
from your vermilion mouth. As if
at the ritual moment of departure
I had to show you still belonged to me.
As if revision were
the purest form of love. 


As dawn’s amber-hush operas, cast orb’s subdued flames over purple hills, 
As bejeweled dew’s still visitations, as amethyst- sapphire rays’ part painted canopies, 
As defiant anthers spark floral fires, preside over marriage of taping vines, 
As stifled water dreams in a rainbow, joins quick –silver rolling streams, 
As among ambrosial saffron fruits, tinted birds mutter hosanna, runaway petals sprinkle, 
As drawl of indigo skies; primrose west seeks auroral light, fireflies sparkle, 
Thus he generously splashes colors, where his silence is still a noise, 
To mutely appreciate, not participate, in vermillion –robed pericarpium, await his voice



THE Heavenly Circuit; Berenice's Hair;
Tent-pole of Eden; the tent's drapery;
Symbolical glory of thc earth and air!
The Father and His angelic hierarchy
That made the magnitude and glory there
Stood in the circuit of a needle's eye.
Some found a different pole, and where it stood
A pattern on a napkin dipped in blood. 



Black brittle cheap charcoal
Neutral hardest priciest diamonds

Friends
The old word is dead.
The old books are dead.
Our speech with holes like worn-out shoes is dead.
Dead is the mind that led to defeat.

Our poetry has gone sour.
Women's hair, nights, curtains and sofas
Have gone sour.
Everything has gone sour.

My grieved country,
In a flash
You changed me from a poet who wrote love poems
To a poet who writes with a knife

What we feel is beyond words:
We should be ashamed of our poems.

Stirred by Oriental bombast,
By boastful swaggering that never killed a fly,
By the fiddle and the drum,
We went to war,
And lost.

Our shouting is louder than our actions,
Our swords are taller than us,
This is our tragedy.

In short
We wear the cape of civilisation
But our souls live in the stone age

You dont win a war
With a reed and a flute.

Our impatience
Cost us fifty thousand new tents.

Dont curse heaven
If it abandons you,
Dont curse circumstances,

It's painful to listen to the news in the morning
It's painful to listen to the barking of dogs.

Our enemies did not cross our borders
They crept through our weaknesses like ants.

Five thousand years
Growing beards
In our caves.
Our currency is unknown,
Our eyes are a haven for flies.
Friends,
Smash the doors,
Wash your brains,
Wash your clothes.
Friends,
Read a book,
Write a book,
Grow words, pomegranates and grapes,
Sail to the country of fog and snow.
Nobody knows you exist in caves.
People take you for a breed of mongrels.

We are a thick-skinned people
With empty souls.
We spend our days practicing witchcraft,
Playing chess and sleeping.

Our desert oil could have become
Daggers of flame and fire.
We're a disgrace to our noble ancestors:
We let our oil flow through the toes of whores.

We run wildly through the streets
Dragging people with ropes,
Smashing windows and locks.
We praise like frogs,
Turn midgets into heroes,
And heroes into scum:
We never stop and think.
In mosques
We crouch idly,
Write poems,
Proverbs,
Over our enemy

If i knew I'd come to no harm,
And could see the Sultan,
This is what i would say:
'Sultan,
Your wild dogs have torn my clothes
Your spies hound me
Their eyes hound me
Their noses hound me
Their feet hound me
They hound me like Fate
Interrogate my wife
And take down the name of my friends.
Sultan,
When I came close to your walls
and talked about my pains,
Your soldiers beat me with their boots,
Forced me to eat my shoes.
Sultan,
You lost two wars,
Sultan,
Half of our people are without tongues,
What's the use of a poeple without tongues?
Half of our people
Are trapped like ants and rats
Between walls.'
If i knew I'd come to no harm
I'd tell him:
'You lost two wars
You lost touch with children.'


If we hadn't buried our unity
If we hadn't ripped its young body with bayonets
If it had stayed in our eyes
The dogs wouldn't have savaged our flesh.

We do not want an angry generation
To plough the sky
To blow up history
To blow up our thoughts.
We want a new generation
That does not forgive mistakes
That does not bend.
We want a generation of giants.

Arab children,
Corn ears of the future,
You will break our chains,
Kill the opium in our heads,
Kill the illusions.
Arab children,
Don't read about our suffocated generation,
We are a hopeless case.
We are as worthless as a water-melon rind.
Dont read about us,
Dont ape us,
Dont accept us,
Dont accept our ideas,
We are a nation of crooks and jugglers.
Arab children,
Spring rain,
Corn ears of the future,
You are the generation
That will overcome defeat. 



In eighteen sixty three, with pomp,
and mighty swell,
Me and Jeff’s Confederacy, went
forth to sack Phil-del,
The Yankees the got arter us, and
giv us particular hell,
And we skedaddled back again,
And didn’t sack Phil-del. 

I.
A cat in distress,
Nothing more, nor less;
Good folks, I must faithfully tell ye,
As I am a sinner,
It waits for some dinner 
To stuff out its own little belly.

II.
You would not easily guess
All the modes of distress
Which torture the tenants of earth;
And the various evils, 
Which like so many devils,
Attend the poor souls from their birth.

III.
Some a living require,
And others desire
An old fellow out of the way; 
And which is the best
I leave to be guessed,
For I cannot pretend to say.

IV.
One wants society,
Another variety, 
Others a tranquil life;
Some want food,
Others, as good,
Only want a wife.

V.
But this poor little cat 
Only wanted a rat,
To stuff out its own little maw;
And it were as good
SOME people had such food,
To make them HOLD THEIR JAW


Should you employ your Ridicule,
On those who Pity claim?
Think, Birtha, is the native Fool
For Wit a proper Theme?

On Vice your hum'rous Vein display;
'Tis meritorious there;
Or tow'ring Vanity allay;
But, O! Misfortune spare.

With Wisdom who endows the Brain,
To thy Remembrance call;
Nor, while the Wretched you sustain,
Tincture their Cup with Gall. 


As thro' this sylvan Scene I stray'd,
I saw and lov'd the Iv'ry Maid:
And hearing that she fled from Man,
I begg'd this Form of mighty Pan;
To try, by ev'ry winning Art,
To gain Possession of her Heart;
When raging Tempests cloud the Sky,
Transported at her Feet to lie;
When Phoebus brightens up the Weather,
To trip it o'er the Lawns together. 


In silent night when rest I took,
     For sorrow near I did not look,
     I waken'd was with thund'ring noise
     And piteous shrieks of dreadful voice.
     That fearful sound of 'fire' and 'fire,'
     Let no man know is my Desire.
   I starting up, the light did spy,
    To straighten me in my Distress
   And not to leave me succourless.
   Then coming out, behold a space
   The flame consume my dwelling place.
   And when I could no longer look,
   I blest his grace that gave and took,
   That laid my goods now in the dust.
   Yea, so it was, and so 'twas just.
   It was his own; it was not mine.
   Far be it that I should repine,
   He might of all justly bereft
   But yet sufficient for us left.
   When by the Ruins oft I past
   My sorrowing eyes aside did cast
   And here and there the places spy
   Where oft I sate and long did lie.
   Here stood that Trunk, and there that chest,
   There lay that store I counted best,
   My pleasant things in ashes lie
   And them behold no more shall I.
   Under the roof no guest shall sit,
   Nor at thy Table eat a bit.
   No pleasant talk shall 'ere be told
   Nor things recounted done of old.
   No Candle 'ere shall shine in Thee,
   Nor bridegroom's voice ere heard shall bee.
   In silence ever shalt thou lie.
   Adieu, Adieu, All's Vanity.
   Then straight I 'gin my heart to chide:
   And did thy wealth on earth abide,
   Didst fix thy hope on mouldring dust,
   The arm of flesh didst make thy trust?
   Raise up thy thoughts above the sky
   That dunghill mists away may fly.
   Thou hast a house on high erect
   Fram'd by that mighty Architect,
   With glory richly furnished
   Stands permanent, though this be fled.
   It's purchased and paid for too
   By him who hath enough to do.
   A price so vast as is unknown,
   Yet by his gift is made thine own.
   There's wealth enough; I need no more.
   Farewell, my pelf; farewell, my store.
   The world no longer let me love;
   My hope and Treasure lies above. 


Perhaps the purpose of leaves is to conceal
 the verticality of trees which we notice in December 
as if for the first time: row after row of dark forms
 yearning upwards. And since we will be horizontal
 ourselves for so long, let us now honor
 the gods of the vertical: stalks of wheat which
 to the ant must seem as high as these trees do to us,
 silos and telephone poles, stalagmites and skyscrapers. 
but most of all these winter oaks, these soft-fleshed poplars,
 this birch whose bark is like roughened skin against
 which I lean my chilled head, not ready to lie down.


'Veruca Salt, the little brute,
Has just gone down the garbage chute,
(And as we very rightly thought
That in a case like this we ought
To see the thing completely through,
We've polished off her parents, too.)
Down goes Veruca! Down the drain!
And here, perhaps, we should explain
That she will meet, as she descends,
A rather different set of friends
To those that she has left behind–
These won't be nearly so refined.
A fish head, for example, cut
This morning from a halibut.
'Hello! Good morning! How d'you do?
How nice to meet you! How are you?'
And then a little further down
A mass of others gather round:
A bacon rind, some rancid lard,
A loaf of bread gone stale and hard,
A steak that nobody could chew,
An oyster from an oyster stew,
Some liverwurst so old and gray
One smelled it from a mile away,
A rotten nut, a reeky pear,
A thing the cat left on the stair,
And lots of other things as well,
Each with a rather horrid smell.
These are Veruca's new found friends
That she will meet as she descends,
And this is the price she has to pay
For going so very far astray.
But now, my dears, we think you might
Be wondering–is it really right
That every single bit of blame
And all the scolding and the shame
Should fall upon Veruca Salt?
Is she the only one at fault?
For though she's spoiled, and dreadfully so,
A girl can't spoil herself, you know.
Who spoiled her, then? Ah, who indeed?
Who pandered to her every need?
Who turned her into such a brat?
Who are the culprits? Who did that?
Alas! You needen't look so far
To find out who these sinners are.
They are (and this is very sad)
Her loving parents, MUM and DAD.
And that is why we're glad they fell
Into the garbage chute as well.


'Walking by a silent Street
Was a little girl with verve
What amazed me most of all
Was her smiling curve

She had a sparkle in her eye
Oh yes!  I did observe
And when she whispered with ecstasy
The happiness she served

The energy she had; was never to conserve
This Memorable moment is what.. I always preserve! 


One thing that literature would be greatly the better for
Would be a more restricted employment by the authors of simile and
metaphor.
Authors of all races, be they Greeks, Romans, Teutons or Celts,
Can't seem just to say that anything is the thing it is but have to
go out of their way to say that it is like something else.
What does it mean when we are told
That that Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold?
In the first place, George Gordon Byron had enough experience
To know that it probably wasn't just one Assyrian, it was a lot of
Assyrians.
However, as too many arguments are apt to induce apoplexy and
thus hinder longevity.
We'll let it pass as one Assyrian for the sake of brevity.
Now then, this particular Assyrian, the one whose cohorts were
gleaming in purple and gold,
Just what does the poet mean when he says he came down like a
wold on the fold?
In heaven and earth more than is dreamed of in our philosophy
there are great many things.
But I don't imagine that among them there is a wolf with purple
and gold cohorts or purple and gold anythings.
actually like a wolf I must have some kind of proof;
Did he run on all fours and did he have a hairy tail and a big red
mouth and big white teeth and did he say Woof Woof?
Frankly I think it is very unlikely, and all you were entitled to say,
at the very most,
Was that the Assyrian cohorts came down like a lot of Assyrian
cohorts about to destroy the Hebrew host.
had to invent a lot of figures of speech and then interpolate them,
With the result that whenever you mention Old Testament soldiers
to people they say Oh yes, they're the ones that a lot of
wolves dressed up in gold and purple ate them.
That's the kind of thing that's being done all the time by poets,
from Homer to Tennyson;
They're always comparing ladies to lilies and veal to venison,
And they always say things like that the snow is a white blanket
after a winter storm.
Oh it is, is it, all right then, you sleep under a six-inch blanket of
snow and I'll sleep under a half-inch blanket of unpoetical
blanket material and we'll see which one keeps warm,
And after that maybe you'll begin to comprehend dimly
What I mean by too much metaphor and simile.

Droops on the little hands little gold head.
Hush! Hush! Whisper who dares!

Wasn't it fun in the bath to-night?
The cold's so cold, and the hot's so hot.

If I open my fingers a little bit more,
I can see Nanny's dressing-gown on the door.
It's a beautiful blue, but it hasn't a hood.

Mine has a hood, and I lie in bed,
And pull the hood right over my head,
And I shut my eyes, and I curl up small,
And nobody knows that I'm there at all.

And what was the other I had to say?
I said 'Bless Daddy,' so what can it be?

Little Boy kneels at the foot of the bed,
Droops on the little hands little gold head.
Hush! Hush! Whisper who dares!


Vespers

The hammer falls silent, a mourning dove coos in the pigeon house by the olive grove, and in the renovated church the bells ring for vespers.

I close the ancient Book of the Sea to read from a pocket-sized manual of prayers, trading soundings and silhouettes of headlands for another anchorage:

Now that the day hath run its course, I praise thee, O Holy One-

And if my petitions for favor lead to an examination of the soul?

Forty years ago, boarding a sailboat, I saw my father wind his watch around his wallet, a stripe of gold cinching a wad of leather, like an amulet.

And when the mast snapped in a gust of wind, capsizing the boat, his watch and wallet sank to the bottom of the lake.

What I remember from underwater were the bubbles of my breath rising to the surface, the taste of algae, the greenish tinge of the sun and sky.

Thus a life of pure sensation passed before my eyes—and little has changed since then.

Time and money, my father joked, rowing back to shore.


         their shadows across the sand
                  dark thoughts crossing the mind.
Beyond the fringe of coast, shrimpers
         hoist their nets, weighing the harvest
                  against the day's losses. Light waning,
concentration is a lone gull
         circling what's thrown back. Debris
                  weights the trawl like stones.
All day, this dredging—beneath the tug
         of waves—rhythm of what goes out, 
                  comes back, comes back, comes back.‘VESTIGE’

When the last charge sounds
And the battle thunders o'er the plain,
Thunders o'er the trenches where the red streams flow,
Will it not be well with us,
Veterans, veterans,
If, beneath your torn old flag, we burst upon the foe?


When the last post sounds
And the night is on the battle-field,
Night and rest at last from all the tumult of our wars,
Will it not be well with us,
Veterans, veterans,
If, with duty done like yours, we lie beneath the stars?

When the great reveille sounds
For the terrible last Sabbath,
All the legions of the dead shall hear the trumpet ring!
Will it not be well with us,
Veterans, veterans,
If, beneath your torn old flag, we rise to meet our King


The ceremonies of the day have ceased,
Abandoned to the ragged crow's parade.
The flags unravel in the caterpillar's feast.
The wreaths collapse onto the stones they shade.

How quietly doves gather by the gate
Like souls who have no heaven and no hell.
The patient grass reclaims its lost estate
Where one stone angel stands as sentinel.

The voices whispering in the burning leaves,
Faint and inhuman, what can they desire
When every season feeds upon the past,
And summer's green ignites the autumn's fire?

The afternoon's a single thread of light
Sewn through the tatters of a leafless willow,
As one by one the branches fade from sight,
And time curls up like paper turning yellow. 


Some nights are never-ending hells
for these old veterans in our care.
We do not hand out pills, but shells, 
as out of battlefields they stare
from over sixty years ago
on far-off Guam or Guadalcanal.
With trembling hands they try to show
how the bravest or youngest fell.
We console them with a cold cup, 
and a tender tap on the shoulder.
What haunts them, though, will not give up, 
nor the fallen boys grow older. 


His army jacket bore the white rectangle   
of one who has torn off his name.  He sat mute   
at the round table where the trip-wire veterans   
ate breakfast.  They were foxhole buddies   
who went stateside without leaving the war.   
They had the look of men who held their breath   
and now their tongues.  What is to say
beyond that said by the fathers who bent lower   
and lower as the war went on, spines curving   
toward the ground on which sons sat sandbagged   
with ammo belts enough to make fine lace   
of enemy flesh and blood.  Now these who survived,   
who got back in cargo planes emptied at the front,
lived hiddenly in the woods behind fence wires   
strung through tin cans.  Better an alarm   
than the constant nightmare of something moving   
on its belly to make your skin crawl   
with the sensory memory of foxhole living. 




You radiate such sparkling joy
Your happiness contagious
 A child surprised by some new toy
Your laughter is bodacious

You wear this talent unaware
Electrons fill the room
Remediall you charge the air
Dispelling clouds of gloom

You presence leaves an after-glow
A perfume heaven sent
Your smile a flower blooming slow
A lingering event


I 'listed at home for a lancer,
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
I 'listed at home for a lancer
  To ride on a horse to my grave.

And over the seas we were bidden
  A country to take and to keep;
And far with the brave I have ridden,
  And now with the brave I shall sleep.

For round me the men will be lying
  That learned me the way to behave,
And showed me my business of dying:
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

They ask, and there is not an answer;
Says I, I will 'list for a lancer,
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

And I with the brave shall be sleeping
  At ease on my mattress of loam,
When back from their taking and keeping
  The squadron is riding at home.

The wind with the plumes will be playing,
  The girls will stand watching them wave,
And eyeing my comrades and saying
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

They ask, and there is not an answer;
Says you, I will 'list for a lancer,
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave

Down in the state of Maine, the story goes,
A woman, to secure a lapsing pension,
That very common act scarce calls for mention.
What makes it worthy to be writ and read
The man she married had been nine hours dead!

Now, marrying a corpse is not an act
Familiar to our daily observation,
And so I crave her pardon if the fact
Suggests this interesting speculation:
Should some mischance restore the man to life
Would she be then a widow, or a wife?

Let casuists contest the point; I'm not
Disposed to grapple with so great a matter.
'T would tie my thinker in a double knot
And drive me staring mad as any hatter
Though I submit that hatters are, in fact,
Sane, and all other human beings cracked.

Small thought have I of Destiny or Chance;
Luck seems to me the same thing as Intention;
In metaphysics I could ne'er advance,
And think it of the Devil's own invention.
Enough of joy to know though when I wed
I _must_ be married, yet I _may_ be dead. 

She’s the village’s Force For Good –
or that’s the flag she sails under; 
news of distant earthquakes, floods, 
famines, ethnic or other massacres
are her stoke-up calls-
she’ll soon be knocking at your door, 
or coming up to speak to you at the WI
or after church-

knowing that you know she knows
you know the details of just how fortunate
she thinks herself, to have survived
that terrible childhood (details vague) : 
so by extension, you should know yourself, and show yourself, 
fortunate too- by giving to the latest cause-

Have her in for drinks, and her roving eye
will spot that electric towel rail you don’t now use
which would be just the thing which would alleviate
the widow Smith- Though, should that widow Smith
dare to grumble to her – and she’d sharply (with a smile) 
remind her, aren’t we lucky, dear, we’ve got
the Social Services here, while they, poor things-

How she delights in, praises, our new outfits
which we bought last week in town! 
We don’t need to be told what follows
as the night the day – we should have
a still-smart something to pass on to her-
though I’ve yet to see an African
caught on TV wearing my old Top Shop number-

Sometimes, husbands take the mickey..
‘How is it that now we no longer hear
about the Burmese tragedy, Martha, now
the orphans of Darfur are in the news? ’-and
in private, joke to us about calling in Miss Marple
to root out the village emotional blackmailer


The one house in the village and the largest
is the one she least often calls upon, 
and that only in the afternoon
when the housekeeper’s in, but the owner’s
still at work: Alan was a kid to five adoptive families, 
three of whom were good- now he’s the owner
of a large industrial firm whose workers love him-
At their first meeting, when she tried
her own pathetic story, his curt
‘Oh get over it..’ has sealed their subsequent relationship-

Somehow, I’ve never warmed to her
since that first visit, when she stood
dead-heading the geraniums around the door
while exchanging pleasantries-
and left me steeped in self-reproach
and communal inadequacy-

Chaucer, with his perceptive and discerning eye
would have spotted this Martha of the many causes-
‘Methinks she has the more concern
for Mercie’s name, than for the human soul-’

He’s the spokesman for his faith – although
faith is a word that seldom elevates his speech; 
perceived injustice is his line: it’s rather, our bad faith; 
a speech about immigrants by one authority, 
made only a day before
the figures of illegals published by another-
conspiracy against his community is his suspicion
(while his community just get on with it-) 

extreme cynics who know their extremist radicals
deconstruct his subtext to be saying, 
we’re only a poor community, but
we wire up terror like the best –
you have been warned


and we, the tolerant and good-hearted, 
forbear from that sharp riposte
which would have him foaming at the mike-
if you feel so badly picked upon, so disapprove
of your adopted country and its morals, 
that you desire to meddle in its politics and laws –
then why not return to the country you were born in, 
whose messy state, you and yours have failed to deal with-? 
Of course, he can’t, because it’s just too dangerous-
Back hopme, they’re just him, but on the ‘other’ side


Oh perfidious Albion! Have you forgotten
your imperialist and sharply-ordered past? 
The guilt of centuries lies heavy on thy heart –

well, at least as far back, as the Danish invasions
of massacre, rape and loot; the marauding Jutes before them, 
the migrating Saxons before that; and the Roman soldiers, 
law-givers and architects and builders, before them-? 

Yes, it’s time for an Emotional Blackmail Studies
Department in the local Poly- there should be
no lack of smiling lecturers, to remind us
how fortunate you are, mate, to be educated


I’m thinking of applying
for a lecturer’s post, myself-
wait til the appointments board
hear my personal cv of injustice done, 
childhood without care or opportunity, 
the bruises bravely borne-
a triumph of self-education out of the gutter-
and if they turn me down-
well, they know what’s coming to them


And his death came in December,
When our summer was aglow—
Like a song that we remember,
Like a child’s dream long ago,
And it brought Australia to him,
Her sweetest singer dead,
While in silence friends who knew him
Bowed their heads beside his bed.


Angel Death comes softly stealing
When the watchers’ eyes are dim,
And, when all has failed in healing
Wounded heart or helpless limb—
With a whisper we may hear not
’Till with "Adsum" we respond,
And a vision we shall fear not
Of the Peaceful Land beyond.

While Australians in their blindness
Fail to realize their loss,
Place the wreath of loving kindness
And raise the simple cross.
For he taught us to be brothers
And he taught us to be brave—
And we’ll banish pride and envy
With a hand-clasp by his grave. 


Heart of France for a hundred years,
Passionate, sensitive, proud, and strong,
Quick to throb with her hopes and fears,
Fierce to flame with her sense of wrong!
You, who hailed with a morning song
Dream-light gilding a throne of old:
You, who turned when the dream grew cold,
Singing still, to the light that shone
Pure from Liberty's ancient throne,
Over the human throng!
You, who dared in the dark eclipse,--
When the pygmy heir of a giant name
Dimmed the face of the land with shame,--
Speak the truth with indignant lips,
Call him little whom men called great,
Scoff at him, scorn him, deny him,
Point to the blood on his robe of state,
Fling back his bribes and defy him!

You, who fronted the waves of fate
As you faced the sea from your island home,
Exiled, yet with a soul elate,
Sending songs o'er the rolling foam,
Bidding the heart of man to wait
For the day when all should see
Floods of wrath from the frowning skies
Fall on an Empire founded in lies,
And France again be free!
You, who came in the Terrible Year
Swiftly back to your broken land,
Now to your heart a thousand times more dear,--
Prayed for her, sung to her, fought for her,
Patiently, fervently wrought for her,
Till once again,
After the storm of fear and pain,
High in the heavens the star of France stood clear!


You, who knew that a man must take
Good and ill with a steadfast soul,
Holding fast, while the billows roll
Over his head, to the things that make
Life worth living for great and small,--
Honour and pity and truth,
The heart and the hope of youth,
You, to whom work was rest,
Dauntless Toiler of the Sea,
Following ever the joyful quest
Of beauty on the shores of old Romance,
Bard of the poor of France,
And warrior-priest of world-wide charity!

You who loved little children best
Of all the poets that ever sung,
Great heart, golden heart,
Old, and yet ever young,
Minstrel of liberty,
Lover of all free, winged things,
Now at last you are free,--
Your soul has its wings!
Heart of France for a hundred years,
Floating far in the light that never fails you,
Over the turmoil of mortal hopes and fears
Victor, forever victor, the whole world hails you


A thousand years by sea and land
Our race hath served the island kings,
But not by custom's dull command
To-day with song her Empire rings:

Not all the glories of her birth,
Her armed renown and ancient throne,
Could make her less the child of earth
Or give her hopes beyond our own:

But stayed on faith more sternly proved
And pride than ours more pure and deep,
She loves the land our fathers loved
And keeps the fame our sons shall keep. 


The schools marched in procession in happiness and pride, 
The city bands before them, the soldiers marched beside; 
Oh, starched white frocks and sashes and suits that high schools wear, 
The boy scout and the boy lout and all the rest were there, 
And all flags save Australia's flag waved high in sun and air! 

The Girls' High School, and Grammar School and colleges of stone 
Flew all flags from their walls and towers – all flags except our own! 
And down here in the alleys where Premiers never come, 
Nor candidate, nor delegate, nor sound of fife and drum, 
They packed them on the lorries, seared children of the slum. 

Each face seemed soiled and faded, though scrubbed with household soap, 
And older than a mother-face, but with less sign of hope: 
The knowledge of things evil, of drunken wreck and hag, 
Of sordid sounds and voices, the everlasting "nag" – 
Oh, men without a battle-song! Oh, men without a flag! 

They breed a nation's strength behind each shabby little door, 
The sounds that hurt the mother's heart affright the children there – 
Alarm-clocks on an empty tin, the tin tray on a chair; 
For weary folk are hard to wake in hot and heavy air. 

They sang in Pride's Procession that Mammon might endure – 
Oh, wistful singing faces, the children of the poor! 
Oh, hideous fiends of commerce! Oh, ghouls of business strife! 
I wait the coming of the things to wake the land to life; 
The flag without a cross or bar, the drum without a fife


All night the ways of Heaven were desolate,
 Long roads across a gleaming empty sky.
 Outcast and doomed and driven, you and I,
Alone, serene beyond all love or hate,
Terror or triumph, were content to wait,
 We, silent and all-knowing.  Suddenly
 Swept through the heaven low-crouching from on high,
One horseman, downward to the earth's low gate.

Oh, perfect from the ultimate height of living,
 Lightly we turned, through wet woods blossom-hung,
Into the open.  Down the supernal roads,
 With plumes a-tossing, purple flags far flung,
Rank upon rank, unbridled, unforgiving,


I.
Before those golden altar-lights we stood,
Each one of us remembering his own dead.
A more than earthly beauty seemed to brood
On that hushed throng, and bless each bending head.

Beautiful on that gold, the deep-sea blue
Of those young seamen, ranked on either side,
Blent with the khaki, while the silence grew
Deep, as for wings--Oh, deep as England's pride.

Beautiful on that gold, two banners rose--
Two flags that told how Freedom's realm was made,
One fair with stars of hope, and one that shows
The glorious cross of England's long crusade;

Two flags, now joined, till that high will be done
Which sent them forth to make the whole world one.


II.

There were no signs of joy that eyes could see.
Our hearts were all three thousand miles away.
There were no trumpets blown for victory.
A million dead were calling us that day.

And eyes grew blind, at times; but grief was deep,
Deeper than any foes or friends have known;
For Oh, my country's lips are locked to keep
Her bitterest loss her own, and all her own.

Only the music told what else was dumb,
The funeral march to which our pulses beat;
For all our dead went by, to a muffled drum
We heard the tread of all those phantom feet.

Yes. There was victory! Deep in every soul.
We heard them marching to their unseen goal.


III.

There, once again, we saw the Cross go by,
The Cross that fell with all those glorious towers,
Burnt black in France or mocked on Calvary,
Till--in one night--the crosses rose like flowers,
Legions of small white crosses, mile on mile,
Pencilled with names that had outfought all pain,
Where every shell-torn acre seems to smile--
_Who shall destroy the cross that rose again?_

Out of the world's Walpurgis, where hope perished,
Where all the forms of faith in ruin fell,
Where every sign of heaven that earth had cherished
Shrivelled among the lava-floods of hell,

The eternal Cross that conquers might with right
Rose like a star to lead us through the night.


IV.

How shall the world remember? Men forget:
Our dead are all too many even for Fame!
Man's justice kneels to kings, and pays no debt
To those who never courted her acclaim.

Cheat not your heart with promises to pay
For gifts beyond all price so freely given.
Where is the heart so rich that it can say
To those who mourn, 'I will restore your heaven'?

But these, with their own hands, laid up their treasure
Where never an emperor can break in and steal,
Treasure for those that loved them past all measure
In those high griefs that earth can never heal,

Proud griefs, that walk on earth, yet gaze above,
Knowing that sorrow is but remembered love.


V.

Love that still holds us with immortal power,
Yet cannot lift us to His realm of light;
Love that still shows us heaven for one brief hour
Only to daunt the heart with that sheer height;

Love that is made of loveliness entire
In form and thought and act; and still must shame us
Because we ever acknowledge and aspire,
And yet let slip the shining hands that claim us.

O, if this Love might cloak with rags His glory,
Laugh, eat and drink, and dwell with suffering men,
Sit with us at our hearth, and hear our story,
This world--we thought--might be transfigured then.

'But Oh,' Love answered, with swift human tears,
'All these things have I done, these many years.'


VI.

'This day,' Love said, 'if ye will hear my voice;
I mount and sing with birds in all your skies.
I am the soul that calls you to rejoice.
And every wayside flower is my disguise.

'Look closely. Are the wings too wide for pity?
Look closely. Do these tender hues betray?
How often have I sought my Holy City?
How often have ye turned your hearts away?

'Is there not healing in the beauty I bring you?
Am I not whispering in green leaves and rain,
Singing in all that woods and seas can sing you?
Look, once, on Love, and earth is heaven again.

'O, did your Spring but once a century waken,
The heaven of heavens for this would be forsaken.'


VII.

There's but one gift that all our dead desire,
One gift that men can give, and that's a dream,
Unless we, too, can burn with that same fire
Of sacrifice; die to the things that seem;

Die to the little hatreds; die to greed;
Die to the old ignoble selves we knew;
Die to the base contempts of sect and creed,
And rise again, like these, with souls as true.

Nay (since these died before their task was finished)
Attempt new heights, bring even their dreams to birth:--
Build us that better world, Oh, not diminished
By one true splendor that they planned on earth.



And that's not done by sword, or tongue, or pen,

Victory but a veil, 
of lies, treachery and deceit.
The web spun around your heart, 
that makes it believe it's complete.

Victory but a veil
that hides you from the truth, 
The fallacy that makes you believe
the impossible, even with no proof.

Victory but a veil
of scorn, lust and despair.
The thing that makes you believe
in the things that were never really there.

Victory comes late—
And is held low to freezing lips—
Too rapt with frost
To take it—
How sweet it would have tasted—
Just a Drop—
His Table's spread too high for Us—
Unless We dine on tiptoe—
Crumbs—fit such little mouths—
Cherries—suit Robbins—
The Eagle's Golden Breakfast strangles—Them—
Who of little Love—know how to starve—



Victory tastes sweet to the tongue
propels 
envisions the lunge
But restrained, 
Contained, 
Centuries have passed
Crisscrossed
Martial passions do not cloud
Lifeless debauched yet made proud
What was, was to be
To reflect and to see
To dwell in glee
or
A wanton failed spree
Made divinely? for ye to botch? 
Gurgle! laugh and descend a notch.
I am great, the unswerving the tiger the stitch
Were it not for the puny men’s glitch
Haahaaa! Ah! I would have them done
If only the weak would not run
If only
a ladle of soup- nay water a sip
If only 
some where courage would drip
If only 
some one would thumb up a clip
If only 
my friends an masters would just hold
Yes 
Bless
Then different worlds would unfold


Who perished by the sea
                            ooo
As soon as I woke up this morning
I felt overwhelmed by memories of long ago past.
Many years of war tore my country apart
Million people left their relatives and their country Vietnam.

After losing the war, many people escaped for their lives
With their possessions in their handbags or knapsacks.
They left everything behind hoping to be alive
They were willing to sacrifice for their future lives.

They left their homes when it rained or shined.
Mountain passes or deep rivers couldn't stop their determination.
Their eyes embraced their native country for the last time
Pacific Ocean was waiting for them
They prayed to reach the other shore alive. 

The other shore of Pacific Ocean was very far away
Few thousand people trampled
To board cargo ship Trường-Xuan for a life of freedom.
At Saigon river port on the day that South Vietnam turned red
Those luckily departed suffered a great deal
Those who remained behind suffered hundred times more.

Those who tried to escape followed others' steps
In the dark of the night they moved around like ghosts.
Any sound of dog barking could bring them disasters
Sudden whistle or gun shot could bring end to one's life

People escaped from  Central, South, North Vietnam
Boat people tragedies recorded  forever in human history
My daughter-in-law succeeded after thirteen attempts
Many people died in their search of Freedom.

For many years, many people tried to escape by the sea
Their fate was like a bell being hung by a thread
Big waves tossed small fishing boats like tiny leaves
Many boats  broke apart and people sank to ocean floor.

Tens of thousand boats departed but how many arrived? 
Because of their overloads many boats were capsized
In addition to boat-filled suffering, sea pirates attacked
They raped, killed and tossed people to feed the sea.

Many refugee camps were filled with innumerable people
Their accumulated tears flowed like rivers
They cried for their country and those who died by the sea
Million people mourned for their expatriation.
 
With mountain-high sadness they marched forward together
They worked very hard to build their lives over
They carried with them their own fates and their nation's fate
They raised high their burning Torches of Freedom.

Some time in the past as Boat people they escaped
Their possessions filled their handbags or knapsacks
Their determination brought them shining paths
The 'parents'built their lives, their children succeeded.

Forty years have passed and I'm looking back in reflection
Like a passing cloud, one half of a man's life has passed.



The sky is beautiful this Saturday morning.

You are lovely in your new dress

Which is a gift from our dear friend who lives afar.

Gracefully flowing are two long flaps of your silk dress

Which is your new purple Vietnamese Áo Dài.

This dress arrived after gliding through clouds and winds.

This dress carries to you the heart of our very dear friend.

This dress wraps in our Vietnamese national spirit.

This dress wraps in my excited loving heart.

With your wedge sandals, you walk graceful steps

While gentle breeze caresses your long silk pants and dress.

As morning breeze lifts your shoulder length hair

You stroke your hair with opening smiles on your lips.

Fresh sunshine makes your rosy cheeks prettier. 

Love flows in your gaze and your passionate smile.




My friend’s daughter got married
And his wife invited my better half
To view the wedding album

A genius close to Bollywood
Had it in Mumbai designed
Aided by brilliant Bangalore techies
And the photos had cost my friend
Several hundred thousands

We had attended the wedding
And having witnessed the proceedings
I asked my wife what is there again
So much to see in a recording

She ruled I was asinine
With an unwed daughter in the house
I needed to familiarize
How the Joneses were conducting
Leaving me perspiring
At the thought of outdoing
My friend’s wanton squandering

Choiceless I dogged
Her to my friend’s abode
On the way she warned
I was rather clumsy
Needed to be interactive 
With society than rot like a rustic

She instructed me to wow
Never ever yawn
Throughout the gruesome viewing
The hosts would be keen
About our comments and reactions
We shouldn’t disenchant
The good heavenly souls

Yes, they were indeed keen
Of angelic countenance
I could see them askance
Looking at our faces
Rejoicing at our pretense

And I was horrified
There were in all five
Fat albums in a line
We would certainly age
Before we viewed the whole footage

I  wowed at every snapshot
Like an exultant school brat
Perhaps, the act I overdid
The pain in my wife’s friendly nudges said

The hosts poured over us
Explaining who was who
When, where and how
Things that didn’t matter
To be forgotten sooner than later

The maid brought some tea
I just cursed my friend
I had expected drinks
To pep up my morale
Through that tiring ordeal

I sipped half the tea
Left half in the cup
My mom had taught
People of gentle breed
Never gulped or devoured
The whole of what was offered
A tip my wife also approved

We viewed the albums
Late past dinner time
My back was giving in
When the last page was seen

The last album on the board
The half-full cup toppled

Out into an uncertain night
Back home I followed a muttering wife
With a clumsy gait daring not
To look at her glaring eyes


Ghosts demand
as much of your time
as we, your progeny, do.
We crowd around the bed
but they crowd even closer.

They follow you 
into sleep
through your trembling eyelids, 
lodge themselves in your mind
like sparrows nested in a high elm.

Your hands float
above the sheets and straps, 
tracing patterns in the air, 
hesitant, delicate patterns
as if you were shaping a haircut

or molding soft clay into an image
of something old and dear.
When you cough and wake yourself, 
you drag out fragments of your dream
and hurl them at us, 

so confident these ghost events
are the real life you are living.
It is already evening.
The drapes are pulled shut
against the cold light of November stars.

The room shines
in the glare of flat white lights
against beige walls.
You still drift
in and out of sleep, 

wake, wonder where you are
and fumble with the sheets, 
and then go back to sleep
where everything you dream
makes perfect sense.

Last night, I told you
stories from my childhood
shaped by your loving care.
All the time, 
you smiled up at the ceiling.


Then, your head turned
to my side. 
Your pale blue eyes, 
watery and wrinkled, saw me.
'We have a lifetime of memories, Ray.'

Suddenly, memory had changed
me, the son, into Ray, the friend.
Who can tell
why your mind needed
that friendship again? 

'I'm sleeping at Ray Milski's, '
you told the nurse
as she tied your hands
to the side of the bed.
And all this

will be repeated tonight, 
and will be repeated
tomorrow, and again
the next day, and the next.
What else is there to do

but talk over the past, 
since the future for us
is shrinking, 
all our delight squeezed
into the small spaces of the present. 


If you’re sick, or even worse
thank lord for making a nurse

Tender care and her vows
Shiny white and her bows

Broken bone or ego bruised
She by your side till its fused

Do her job with an even keel
ease the pain her patients feel

Oft she’s needed for a smile
For a dying soul, time to while

Words of comfort that she says
Beam as beacons and its rays

Do what she can to do you mend
Failing which for the doctor send

Stand by you to have you hope
As you vex and answers grope

Then there surly comes the day
She’ll lend a hand on your way
 
To muse the gist of a special friend
Who stood by you to the final end



Beyond the brown hill
Above the silent cedars, 
Blackbirds flee the April rains. 

The woman in the pointed hood 
And cloak blue-gray like a pigeon's wing, 
Whose orchard climbs to the balsam-wood, 
Has done a cruel thing.

To her back door-step came a ghost, 
A girl who had been ten years dead, 
She stood by the granite hitching-post 
And begged for a piece of bread.

Now why should I, who walk alone, 
Who am ironical and proud, 
Turn, when a woman casts a stone 
At a beggar in a shroud?

I saw the dead girl cringe and whine, 
And cower in the weeping air-- 
But, oh, she was no kin of mine, 
And so I did not care

A dainty thing's the Villanelle.
Sly, musical, a jewel in rhyme,
It serves its purpose passing well. 

A doublc-clappered silver bell
That must be made to clink in chime, 
A dainty thing's the Villanelle; 

And if you wish to flute a spell,
Or ask a meeting 'neath the lime,
It serves its purpose passing well. 

You must not ask of it the swell 
Of organs grandiose and sublime-
A dainty thing's the Villanelle; 

And, filled with sweetness, as a shell
Is filled with sound, and launched in time,
It serves its purpose passing well. 

Still fair to see and good to smell
As in the quaintness of its prime,
A dainty thing's the Villanelle,
It serves its purpose passing well. 

If you should ever read this you should know
In spite of my walking and talking  tall
I never did let the thought of you go

Did you know I started in life very low? 
I was the one who had wanted it all! 
If you should ever read this you should know.

Did you know I put you on a pedestal? 
I was the one who admired your gall! 
And I never did let the thought of you go.

Do you recall when I said ‘I love you so’? 
I was the one who risked the hardest fall-
If you should ever read this you should know.

Do you recall saying my love was ‘faux’? 
I was the one who ran into a wall.
But I never did let the thought of you go.

After all this time, by chance, we met in a hall.
And I’m the one who would still give you his all-
If you should ever read this you should know, 
That I’ll never let the thought of you go. 


It’s all I can do-
I tried and I try
I’m still aching for you! 

Ever since I met you- 
(You landed in my eye!)         - 
It’s all I can do-

Like a sweet taboo, 
That life should contrive, 
I’m just aching for you! 

I can’t talk to you! 
So this piece I write.
It’s all I can do-

No matter what I do, 
I barely survive, 
I’m sooo aching for you! 

And with this I’ll summarize: 
Baby, It’s all I can do-
I’m really, r e a l l y, aching for you


Wine and woman and song,
Three things garnish our way:
Yet is day over long.

Lest we do our youth wrong,
Gather them while we may:
Wine and woman and song.

Three things render us strong,
Vine leaves, kisses and bay:
Yet is day over long.

Unto us they belong,
Us the bitter and gay,
Wine and women and song.

We, as we pass along,
Are sad that they will not stay;
Yet is day over long.

Fruits and flowers among,
What is better than they:
Wine and women and song?
Yet is day over long. 


With each and every move, 
Using all conceivable tools in sight
You made me into the fool.

To your hunger, I’m but food.
A carnal boon left with nowhere to hide, 
With each and every move.

With a figure divine and cool, 
Legs brushing casually against mine, 
You made me into the fool.

All the while, using you ruse, 
Predatory smile, stirring me inside
With each and every move.

Like Goliath, beaten too soon
I played a chess game,  lost, mated by night 
You made me into the fool.


For my soul’s honor, in vain, I fight 
My body, a trophy, you claim by right
With each and every move, 
You made me into the fool

My window, framed in pear-tree bloom,
White-curtained shone, and softly lighted:
So, by the pear-tree, to my room
Your ghost last night climbed uninvited.

Your solid self, long leagues away,
Deep in dull books, had hardly missed me;
And yet you found this Romeo's way,
And through the blossom climbed and kissed me.

I watched the still and dewy lawn,
The pear-tree boughs hung white above you;
I listened to you till the dawn,
And half forgot I did not love you.

Od, dear! what pretty things you said,
What pearls of song you threaded for me!
I did not-till your ghost had fled-
Remember how you always bore me


O brother men who after us remain,
Do not look coldly on the scene you view,
For if you pity wretchedness and pain,
You see us hang here, half a dozen who
Indulged the flesh in every liberty
Till it was pecked and rotted, as you see,
And these our bones to dust and ashes fall.
Let no one mock our sorry company,

If we have called you brothers, don’t disdain
The appellation, though alas it’s true
That not all men are equal as to brain,
And that our crimes and blunders were not few.
Commend us, now that we are dead, unto
The Virgin Mary’s son, in hopes that He
Will not be sparing of His clemency,
But save our souls, which Satan would enthrall.
We’re dead now, brothers; show your charity

We have been rinsed and laundered by the rain,
And by the sunlight dried and blackened too.
Magpie and crow have plucked our eyeballs twain
And cropped our eyebrows and the beards we grew.
Nor have we any rest at all, for to
And fro we sway at the wind’s fantasy,
Which has no object, yet would have us be
(Pitted like thimbles)  at its beck and call.
Do not aspire to our fraternity,
To spare us Hell’s distress and obloquy; 
We want no part of what may there befall.
And, mortal men, let’s have no mockery,



Introduction: Blindfolded the world fades today, optimism awaits tomorrow. 

Lies have many expressions
Can make one follow the mistaken, 
Love has countless sensations
Can make one feel awaken, 
Seek out the truth from its buried nation
As the deception has made it forsaken

No one knows where you'd disappear
For things you care is what you feel, 
No one knows of what you hear, 
One day you will deem what's real
Ask Almighty to steer you clear
Help you save from your ordeal


Reality's limits
soon sour sexual wine
though, for far too many
vinegar seems just fine.
Imagination keeps
the tastiest kegs; 
sweet fantasies 
will allow
no bitter dregs. 


She cried for all the broken hearts, 
Painted everlasting winters -
Floral patterns etched in ice; 
A frozen tear to 
Soften up the bastard bones.

Bow made love to needy string
In cooing fling - wanton whispers  
Fondled under pianissimos, 
Caressing callous hearts.

Melodrama swayed in satin sound -
Yet the player wasn't there, 
Only creamy song - soothing, yearning, 
Teasing bitter minds.

I sensed her persevering loneliness
For beauty of an evening, 
Romance of a tune - laughing, 
Sobbing at the fire.
 
Then a climax - 
Writhing passion cutting deep -
Wounding macho flesh; 

And all in a work of musical art: 
Ephemeral stories, yarned of music 
Honed impossibly through her tones.

She sleeps in her rose wood bed, 
under a blanket of velvet red; 
old and alone and forgotten, 
she dreams of the love she once had.
 
Once again she recalls his caress
on the curve of her hips
and her breast
as he moved his bow
on the strings of her soul, 
playing her sound
‘til his passion was spent.
                                                                        ~~~

They traveled the whole world over, 
to every city and town; 
the maestro, his bow and violin, 
bringing each curtain down.
                                                                        ~~~

He died in a cry of sweet refrain, 
clutching her strings to his heart; 
as he fell to the floor in a final encore, 
tearing her world apart.
                                                                        ~~~
 
So she sleeps in her rose wood bed, 
under a blanket of velvet red; 
her strings still filled 
with the song of her soul, 
etched by the maestro
that loved her
so long ago! 

                                                                    ~~~~~Alone walking
In thought plaining,
And sore sighing;
All desolate,
Me rememb'ring
Of my living;
My death wishing
Both early and late.

Infortunate
Is so my fate,
That, wot ye what?
Out of measure
My life I hate;
Thus desperate,
In such poor estate,
Do I endure.

Of other cure
Am I not sure;
Thus to endure
Is hard, certain;
Such is my ure,
I you ensure;
What creature
May have more pain?

My truth so plain
Is taken in vain,
And great disdain
In remembrance;
Yet I full fain
Would me complain,
Me to abstain
From this penance.

But, in substance,
None alleggeance
Of my grievance
Can I not find;
Right so my chance,
With displeasance,
Doth me advance;
And thus an end. 


When darkness spreads its veil
the night its many pains
When light no more shines
upon shadows the demon reigns

Bare days merge in useless chore
night lays bare its many harms
When fears they grip the heart
So the bed with its thorny arms

When yearnings pierce the mind
Pain throbs in feet blisters corns
When spells and howls echo
Witches shriek their evil charms

When lonely times spent already
play endless in colorless forms
Then unmet wishes freeze in sighs
soak virgin sheets in happy dorms

Then a dazed feeling takes root
that the twain shall never meet
A wish echoes in the empty heart, 
go, vanish, be unseen like a dying beat






Now and again
All my body springs alive,
And the life that is polarised in my eyes,
That quivers between my eyes and mouth,
Flies like a wild thing across my body,
Leaving my eyes half-empty, and clamorous,
Filling my still breasts with a flush and a flame, 
Gathering the soft ripples below my breast
Into urgent, passionate waves,  
And my soft, slumbering belly
Quivering awake with one impulse of desire,
Gathers itself fiercely together;  
And my docile, fluent arms  
Knotting themselves with wild strength
To clasp—what they have never clasped.
Then I tremble, and go trembling
Under the wild, strange tyranny of my body,
Till it has spent itself,  
And the relentless nodality of my eyes reasserts itself,
Till the bursten flood of life ebbs back to my eyes,
Back from my beautiful, lonely body  
Tired and unsatisfied. 

Clad with garments of dignity
Perfumed with ethical sensitivity
Regal consort of my ecstasy
Untarnished by lewdness and infidelity
Unmatched in integrity and chastity
Blandiloquent bride of my destiny
Untouched before matrimony
Fair virgin of undiluted beauty
To honour you is my joy and duty


It is said that you can only be a virgin once
I am not so sure.

For virginity may be more than physical
and may have to be measured
in emotional purity.

You can make a mistake 
and squander that first time
with the wrong person
but does that mean that
virginity once squandered is lost forever? 

I don't think so.

How many of us even
remember IT, 
so tense that first-time experience? 

Rather, I think
It  like most things in life
relies on practice
to get it right.

Rather, I think that virginity can't be lost
on mere amateurs
who had no idea
of its' importance.

Rather, it depends on my frame of mind.


My virginity was not lost; 
 IT can only be given
and after several times
and after several mistakes
it is bestowed upon the one 
I really loved.
and you know
I now know
the difference
because virginity
isn't given away
unless it releases
in the act
purity and true love. 


Hunched against the wall, ninety-one degrees, August, night—
he crawled out the window—he ran in the dark—

the two fourteen year-olds, in the entry hall he pressed 
his open mouth on the front of her thighs, her ankles, 

all he could reach till her astonished mother broke them apart, 
hitting them with a broom then stopping to slap the back of 

her daughter's head. Still alert thinking of her sweat thick hair 
sticking to her face, the fold of her lips, the vaginal throat, 

the sonata soaking inside of it. He was actually figuring the chances 
of whether a deer really does lie down with a virgin, as in the old 

tapestries, as in the mind that made a good allegory, 
in the mind awake with the animal smell, and the tenderness. 

And it could only be good to be that close to a deer, to have 
red and purple dahlias there for the deer to eat—aren’t they 

the blended color of a deer's mouth and therefore a kind of 
twin growing beside the virgin's lap, where the deer lowered 

its head, so, in the allegory the deer is also her lover, and there is 
no truly crazy mother swinging a broom and then resting it 

so she could pull her daughter's hair, start shrieking in Hungarian 
and Spanish, then pleading to some god about this and this 

and spitting at a deer and knocking a rubber plant over, 
and sweeping dirt onto the Mexican tiles, spattering dirt inside 

the rose cactus heads 
and the bathing suit bottoms. 


What I love about this little leaning mark
is how it divides
without divisiveness.  The left
or bottom side prying that choice up or out,
the right or top side pressing down upon
its choice:  either/or,
his/her.  Sometimes called a slash (too harsh), a slant
(a little dizzy, but the Dickinson association
nice:  "Tell all the Truth but tell it slant--"), solidus (sounding
too much like a Roman legionnaire
of many campaigns),
or a separatrix (reminding one of a sexual
variant).  No, I like virgule.  I like the word
and I like the function:  "Whichever is appropriate
may be chosen to complete the sense

"
There is something democratic
about that, grown-up; a long
and slender walking stick set against the house.
Virgule:  it feels good in your mouth.
Virgule:  its foot on backwards, trochaic, that's OK, American.
Virgule:  you could name your son that,
or your daughter Virgula.  I'm sorry now
I didn't think to give my daughter such a name
though I doubt that she and/or
her mother would share that thought. 


Through the router type a ruse
I am a hooker on the loose

I a pauper with unholy paunch
True to form, a lecherous raunch

I’d never run promised myself
Get the hardware off the shelf

Marching words across a screen.
Pull a fast an the disc is clean

My eyes glued no tear will fall
Just type a quicker for her call

Tears of dismay and of sorrow
Oh! Paste a joke, fake a morrow

Logged off now, but not for long
Hooked she is to my tick tack song

How could they so much mean
There’s no cure an no wean

Nothing stems and no firewalls
If on line, she’s waiting calls

On love or hate I do not thrive
Always on, on forward drive

In this buzz no love no cheat
If your rig is dig be up beat.

The virtual world a veritable trap
Abuzz the genie on my clap


(May Nightfall.  In fear we sprawl
Creatures crawl.  In search of blood
Mystery Drums.  turns on the heat
Stop!
T' is your fast heartbeat! 

Squeak and scream.  Your eyes aglow
Time to know.  The twilight zone
Shadow spree.  subjects’ unseen
Take to your heels?
You can't be free.

Struggle.  you may, to freedom's bay
Imprisoned mind.  Dark side you'll find
But when you feel.  you cannot cope
Just snap to know.  You're all alone. 


I wish I re-wind myself to those times
Where people got connected not phones, 

Where hearts met, 
And not the phone numbers, 

Where we actually stepped out to meet, greet each other
And not chat or wish on skype or Facebook

Everyone today has worn a mask
Calling friends / meeting has become more like a task

Today in this virtual world
Though I am alive I feel dead

I have so many friends online
But I know only in this virtual world I out shine, 

You care for me when I am online
I wonder how many would actually look out for me when I go offline


Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright
The bridal of the earth and sky:
The dew shall weep thy fall tonight,
For thou must die.

Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,
Bids the rash gazer wipe his eyes:
Thy root is ever in its grave,
And thou must die.

Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,
A box where sweets compacted lie:
My music shows ye have your closes,
And all must die.

Only a sweet and virtuous soul,
LIke seasoned timber, never gives;
But though the whole world turn to coal.
Then chiefly lives. 


SHE was so good, and he was so bad
A very pretty time they had!
A pretty time, and it lasted long:
Which of the two was more in the wrong?
He befouled in the slough of sin;
Or she whose piety pushed him in?
He found her yet more cold and staid
As wedded wife than courted maid:
She filled their home with freezing gloom;
He felt it dismal as a tomb:
Her steadfast mind disdained his toys
Of worldly pleasures, carnal joys;
Her heart firm-set on things above
Was frigid to his earthly love.

So he came staggering home at night;
Where she sat chilling, chaste, and white:
She smiled a scornful virtuous smile,
He flung good books with curses vile.
Fresh with the early morn she rose,
While he yet lay in a feverish doze:
She prayed for blessings from the Throne,
He called for "a hair of the dog" with a groan:
The heavy load,—he ’gan to swear:
She sighed, would Heaven, ere yet too late,
Bring him to see his awful state!
The charity thus sweetly pressed
Made him rage like one possessed.


So she grew holier day by day,
While he grew all the other way.
She left him: she had done her part
To wean from sin his sinful heart,
But all in vain; her presence might
Make him a murderer some mad night.
Her family took her back, pure saint,
Serene in soul, above complaint:
The narrow path she strictly trod,
While he into the Union fell,
Our halfway house on the road to Hell.
With which would you rather pass your life
The wicked husband or saintly wife


Her words almost killed me
First time she used the word "you" instead of we
So much hatred and no love words
I almost sank praying the lords

How one can send the disease and virus
How, all of sudden, love can have minus status
I failed to understand her tears and outburst 
It had simple appeal and powerful thrust

Virus had caused tremendous loss
She had nothing left in the name of cross
All her life time  work was just vanished
Peaceful aim and meaningful life perished

She blamed all it to me in person
I was no where responsible for the reason
I too lost all my precious creation
Blame game for me was out of question

Everybody may be victim of this virus
No need to cry or create the fuss
It is how we protect and go further
Nothing should deter us or bother

I failed to convince her of my part
I had no way but to say bye and depart
What left behind was only distrust? 
One should not bank upon simply trust

It may deceive you any moment 
You should keep watch on every movement
Who knows when one may change mind? 
Blind faith may lead you to new kind


Life is all about to love and to be loved
It depends on how one has behaved? 
It looses charm if lacks integrity
One should have real sense and ability

She begged to know the real truth
I had no answer to speak from mouth
What do I know about virus as layman? 

I wished I could cry for her loss
I had every reason to feel remorse
I could feel only sorry for her state
I failed to convince her cruel fate

She blamed all it to me but did not curse
All she wanted to know the truth and nurse
Poems, literature was her only achievement
What was left to her was only astonishment


I was damned
And condemned
For spreading virus

It was due to one message
That was from Iran about nuclear usage
I was trapped with virus infection 

Face book vigilant
And actively present
I was warned of danger
I felt down with anger

Many friends inquired
I could only offer regret 
And apologized for inconvenience
As it has caused turmoil at once 

It could handle the ugly turn
I was not only saved from being hacked
But made escape easier before being shown naked

Is the one you saw. 
Is the one you heard. 
Is the one you comprehend 
when I appealed.  
I ask you now listen good.  
What about the invisible one?  
To which I was drawn.
To which you haven't known. 
Do not frown. 
Am about to explain. 
Two decades ago, I looked inside. 
I looked around. 
Tried to find 
my solid ground.  
It was nowhere to be found. 
So I plunged.  
Deep into marriage, 
adults approved.
Found people who seemed allied.
Bit by bit I gave in.
Support group encouraged, I shone. 
I devotedly served. 

Become favored. 
By him and those around. 
'What a woman! What a breed! '  
Help! Am losing ground! 
This ain't my world! 
'Take it easy. 

You'll get the hang of it. 
Just you wait.' 
Came along life changing gift. 
Welcome baby boy! 
You are my source of joy! 
Followed the second.
Third.
Fourth 
and fifth. 
The ups and downs, 
the winding roads. 
The swamps, the endless gorges. 
The hills the mountains. 
Did I live through all these?  
Have mercy on me heavens above! 
This is where I stop, 
suffered a lot, I have!  
The rift you saw now was conceived before.
Let me go now let me be. 
Let me find my way unchain me.
Divorce is a must. 
Do not intervene get lost.(For Aline) 

Homer, they tell us, was blind and could not see the beautiful faces
 Looking up into his own and reflecting the joy of his dream,
 Yet did he seem
Gifted with eyes that could follow the gods to their holiest places. 

I have no vision of gods, not of Eros with love-arrows laden,
 Yet have I seen
All of the joy of the world in the innocent heart of a maiden. 

Who
                  Are  you
                Who is born
              In the next room
            So  loud  to  my own
        That I can hear the womb
      Opening  and  the  dark  run
  Over the ghost and the dropped son
Behind the wall thin as a wren's bone?
  In the birth  bloody room unknown
    To the  burn and  turn of time
      And the heart print of man
            Bows  no  baptism
              But dark  alone
                Blessing on
                  The wild
                    Child. 

Long had the Sage, the first who dared to brave
The unknown dangers of the western wave,
Who taught mankind where future empires lay
In these fair confines of descending day,
With cares o'erwhelm'd, in life's distressing gloom,
Wish'd from a thankless world a peaceful tomb;
While kings and nations, envious of his name,
Enjoy'd his toils and triumph'd o'er his fame,
And gave the chief, from promised empire hurl'd,
Chains for a crown, a prison for a world.
Now night and silence held their lonely reign,
The half-orb'd moon declining to the main;
Descending clouds, o'er varying ether driven,
Obscured the stars and shut the eye from heaven;
Cold mists through opening grates the cell invade,
And deathlike terrors haunt the midnight shade;
When from a visionary, short repose,
That raised new cares and temper'd keener woes,
Columbus woke, and to the walls address'd
The deep-felt sorrows of his manly breast.

Here lies the purchase, here the wretched spoil,
Of painful years and persevering toil:
For these dread walks, this hideous haunt of pain,
I traced new regions o'er the pathless main,
Dared all the dangers of the dreary wave,
Hung o'er its clefts and topp'd the surging grave,
Saw billowy seas, in swelling mountains roll,
And bursting thunders rock the reddening pole,
Death rear his front in every dreadful form,
Gape from beneath and blacken in the storm;
Till, tost far onward to the skirts of day,
Where milder suns dispens'd a smiling ray,
Through brighter skies my happier sails descry'd
The golden banks that bound the western tide,
And gave the admiring world that bounteous shore
Their wealth to nations and to kings their power

Oh land of transport! dear, delusive coast,
To these fond, aged eyes forever lost!
No more thy gladdening vales I travel o'er,
For me thy mountains rear the head no more,
For me thy rocks no sparkling gems unfold,
Or streams luxuriant wear their paths in gold;
From realms of promised peace forever borne,
I hail dread anguish, and in secret mourn

But dangers past, fair climes explored in vain,
And foes triumphant shew but half my pain
Dissembling friends, each earlier joy who gave,
And fired my youth the storms of fate to brave,
Swarm'd in the sunshine of my happier days,
Pursued the fortune and partook the praise,
Bore in my doubtful cause a twofold part,
The garb of friendship and the viper's heart,
Pass my loath'd cell with smiles of sour disdain,
Insult my woes and triumph in my pain.

One gentle guardian Heaven indulgent gave,
And now that guardian slumbers in the grave
Hear from above, thou dear departed shade,
As once my joys, my present sorrows aid,
Burst my full heart, afford that last relief,
Breathe back my sighs and re-inspire my grief;
Still in my sight thy royal form appears,
Reproves my silence and demands my tears
On that blest hour my soul delights to dwell,
When thy protection bade the canvass swell,
When kings and courtiers found their factions vain,
Blind Superstition shrunk beneath her chain,
The sun's glad beam led on the circling way,
And isles rose beauteous in the western day
But o'er those silvery shores, that fair domain,
What crowds of tyrants fix their horrid reign!
Again fair Freedom seeks her kindred skies,
Truth leaves the world, and Isabella dies

Oh, lend thy friendly shroud to veil my sight,
That these pain'd eyes may dread no more the light,
These welcome shades conclude my instant doom,
And this drear mansion moulder to a tomb

Thus mourn'd the hapless chief; a thundering sound
Roll'd round the shuddering walls and shook the ground;
O'er all the dome, where solemn arches bend,
The roofs unfold and streams of light descend;
The growing splendor fill'd the astonish'd room,
And gales ethereal breathed a glad perfume;
Mild in the midst a radiant seraph shone,
Robed in the vestments of the rising sun;
Tall rose his stature, youth's primeval grace
Moved o'er his limbs and wanton'd in his face,
His closing wings, in golden plumage drest,
With gentle sweep came folding o'er his breast,
His locks in rolling ringlets glittering hung,
And sounds melodious moved his heavenly tongue

Rise, trembling Chief, to scenes of rapture, rise,
This voice awaits thee from the approving skies;
Thy just complaints, in heavenly audience known
Call mild compassion from the indulgent throne;
Let grief no more awake the piteous strain,
Nor think thy piety or toils are vain
Tho' faithless men thy injured worth despise,
Depress all virtue and insult the skies,
Yet look thro' nature, Heaven's own conduct trace,
What power divine sustains the unthankful race!
From that great Source, that life-inspiring Soul,
Suns drew their light and systems learn'd to roll,
Time walk'd the silent round, and life began,
Down the long vale, where rolling years descend,
To thy own days, behold his care extend;
From one eternal Spring, what love proceeds!
Smiles in the seraph, in the Saviour bleeds,
Shines through all worlds, that fill the bounds of space,
And lives and brightens in thy favour'd race.
Yet no return the almighty Power can know,
From earth to heaven no just reward can flow,
Men spread their wants, the all-bounteous hand supplies,
And gives the joys that mortals dare despise
In these dark vales where blinded faction sways,
Wealth pride and conquest claim the palm of praise,
Aw'd into slaves, while groping millions groan,
And blood-stain'd steps lead upwards to a throne

Far other wreaths thy virtuous temples claim,
Far nobler honours build thy sacred name,
Thine be the joys the immortal mind that grace
Pleas'd with the toils, that bless thy kindred race,
Now raise thy ravish'd soul to scenes more bright,
The glorious fruits ascending on thy sight;
For, wing'd with speed, from brighter worlds I came,
To sooth thy grief and show thy distant fame

As that great Seer, whose animating rod
Who led, thro' dreary wastes, the murmuring band
To the fair confines of the promised land,
Oppress'd with years, from Pisgah's beauteous height,
O'er boundless regions cast the raptured sight;
The joys of unborn nations warm'd his breast,
Repaid his toils and sooth'd his soul to rest;
Thus, o'er thy subject wave, shalt thou behold
Far happier realms their future charms unfold,
In nobler pomp another Pisgah rise,
Beneath whose foot thine own Canaumlan lies;
There, rapt in vision, hail the distant clime,
And taste the blessings of remotest time
The Seraph spoke; and now before them lay
(The doors unbarr'd) a steep ascending way,
That, through disparting shades, arose on high,
Reach'd o'er the hills and lengthen'd up the sky,
Oped a fair summit, graced with rising flowers,
Sweet odours breathing through celestial bowers,
O'er proud Hispanian spires, it looks sublime,
Subjects the Alps and levels all the clime
Led by the Power, the hero gain'd the height,
A touch from heaven sublimed his mortal sight,
And, calm beneath them, flow'd the western main,
Far stretch'd, immense, a sky-encircled plain;
No sail, no isle, no cloud invests the bound,
Nor billowy surge disturbs the unvaried round;
Till, deep in distant heavens, the sun's dim ray
Topp'd unknown cliffs and call'd them up to day;
Slow glimmering into sight wide regions drew,
And rose and brighten'd on the expanding view;
Fair sweep the waves, the lessening ocean smiles,
And breathes the fragrance of a thousand isles;
Near and more near the long-drawn coasts arise,
Bays stretch their arms and mountains lift the skies,
The lakes, unfolding, point the streams their way,
The plains the hills their lengthening skirts display,
The vales draw forth, high walk the approaching groves,
And all the majesty of nature moves.
O'er the wild climes his eyes delighted rove,
Where lands extend and glittering waters move;
He saw through central realms, the winding shore
Spread the deep gulph, his sail had traced before,
The rocky isthmus meet the raging tide,
Join distant lands and neighbouring seas divide,
On either side the shores unbounded bend,
Push wide their waves and to the poles ascend;
While two fair continents united rise,
Broad as the main and lengthen'd with the skies.
Such views around them spread, when thus the Guide,
Here bounteous earth displays her noblest pride,
Ages unborn shall bless the happy day,
When thy bold streamers steer'd the trackless way,
O'er these delightful realms thy sons shall tread.
And following millions trace the path you led
Behold yon isles, where first the flag, unfurl'd,
Waved peaceful triumph o'er the newfound world,
Where, aw'd to silence, savage bands gave place,
And hail'd with joy the sun-descended race.
See there the banks that purest waters lave,
Swift Oronoque rolls back the ocean's wave,
The well known current cleaves the lofty coast,
Where Paria's walks thy former footsteps boast
These scanty shores no more thy joys shall bound,
See nobler prospects lead their swelling round,
Nature's sublimest scenes before thee roll,
And years and empires open on thy soul
High to yon seats exalt thy roving view,
Where Quito's lofty plains o'erlook Peru,
On whose broad base, like clouds together driven,
A world exalted props the skirts of heaven
From south to north what long, blue fronts arise!
Ridge over ridge, and lost in ambient skies!
Approaching near, they heave expanding bounds,
The yielding concave bends sublimer rounds,
Earth's loftiest towers there lift the daring height,
And all the Andes fill the bounded sight
Round the low base what sloping breaches bend!
Hills form on hills and trees o'er trees extend,
Ascending, whitening, how the craggs are lost!
O'erwhelm'd with summits of eternal frost;
Broad fields of ice give back the morning ray,
Like walls of suns or heaven's perennial day
There folding storms on eastern pinions ride,
Veil the black heavens and wrap the mountain's side,
The thunders rake the craggs, the rains descend,
And the long lightnings o'er the vallies bend,
While blasts unburden'd sweep the cliffs of snow,
The whirlwinds wheel above, the floods convolve below.
There molten rocks, explosive rend their tomb,
And dread volcanoes ope the nations' doom,
Wild o'er the regions pour the floods of fire,
The shores heave backward and the seas retire
There slumbering vengeance waits the Almighty call,
Long ages hence to shake some guilty wall;
Thy pride, O Lima, swells the sulph'rous wave,
And fanes and priests and idols croud thy grave
But cease, my son, these dread events to trace,
Nor learn the woes that wait thy kindred race.
Beyond those glimmering hills, in lands unknown,
O'er the wide gulph, beyond the flaming zone,
Thro' milder climes, see gentler mountains rise,
Where yon dim regions bound the northern skies
Back from the shore ascending champaigns run,
And lift their heights to hail the eastern sun,
Through all the midland realm, to yon blue pole,
The green hills lengthen and the rivers roll
So spoke the blest Immortal; when, more near,
The northern climes in various pomp appear;
Lands yet unknown, and streams without a name
Rise into vision and demand their fame
As when some saint, in heaven's sublime abode,
While earth's fair circuit in his presence rolls,
Here glows the centre and there point the poles;
O'er land and sea his eyes sublimely rove,
And joys of mortals kindle heaven with love;
With equal glance the great Observer's sight
Ranged the low vale or climb'd the cloudly height,
As, led by heaven's own light, his raptured mind,
Explored the realms that here await mankind
Now the still morn had tinged the mountain's brow
And rising radiance warm'd the plains below;
Stretch'd o'er Virginian hills, in long array,
The beauteous Alleganies met the day
From sultry Mobile's rich Floridian shore,
To where Ontario bids hoarse Laurence roar,
O'er the clear mountain-tops and winding streams,
Rose a pure azure, streak'd with orient beams;
Fair spread the scene, the hero gazed sublime,
And thus in prospect hail'd the happy clime
Blest shores of fame, conceal'd in earlier days
To lure my steps to trace the untempted seas!
And blest the race my guardian Saint shall lead,
Where these tall forests wave the beckoning head
Thro' each wide ridge what various treasures shine!
Sleep there ye diamonds, and ye ores refine
Exalt your heads ye oaks, ye pines ascend
Till future navies bid your branches bend,
Then spread the canvass o'er the subject sea,
Explore new worlds and teach the old your sway
He said, and northward cast his wondering eyes,
Where other cliffs, in other climes, arise,
Where bleak Acadia spreads the dangerous coast,
And isles and shoals their latent horrors boast,
High in the distant heaven, the hoary height
Heaves the glad sailor an eternal light
Nor could those hills, unnoticed, raise their head,
That look sublime o'er Hudson's winding bed;
Tho' no bold fiction rear them to the skies,
And neighbouring summits far superior rise,
Yet the blue Kaatskill, where the storms divide,
Would lift the heavens from Atlas' labouring pride
Awhile the ridgy heights his notice claim,
And hills unnumber'd rose without a name,
Which placed, in pomp, on any eastern shore,
Taurus would shrink, the Alps be sung no more;
For here great nature, more exalted show'd
He saw those mountains ope their watery store,
Floods leave their caves and seek the distant shore,
Down the long hills and through the subject plain,
Roll the delightful currents to the main;
Whose numerous channels cleave the lengthening strand,
And heave their banks where future towns must stand;
He stretch'd his eager glance from pole to pole
Traced all their sources and explored the whole
First, from the dreadful Andes' opening side,
He saw Maranon lead his sovereign tide.
A thousand hills for him dissolve their snow,
A thousand streams obedient bend below,
From distant lands their devious courses wind,
Sweep beds of ore and leave their gold behind,
In headlong cataracts indignant heave,
Rush to his opening banks and swell the sweeping wave
Ucayla, chief of all his mighty sons,
From Cusco's bounds a lengthening circuit runs;
Yutay moves gently in a shorter course,
And rapid Yatva pours a gathering force;
Far in a wild, by nameless tributes fed,
The silent Chavar wears a lonely bed;
Aloft, where northern Quito sits on high,
The roaring Napo quits his misty sky,
Down the long steeps, in whitening torrents driven,
Like Nile descending from his fabled heaven
While other waves and lakes unknown to fame,
Discharge their urns and fill the swelling stream,
That, far, from clime to clime, majestic goes,
Enlarging widening deepening as it flows;
Approaching ocean hears the distant roar,
Moves up the bed, nor finds the expected shore;
His freshening waves, with high and hoary tide,
Whelm back the flood, and isles and champaigns hide,
Till mingling waters lead the downward sweep,
And waves and trees and banks roll whirling to the deep
Now, where the sun in milder glory beams,
Brazilia's hills pour down their spreading streams,
The smiling lakes their opening sides display,
And winding vales prolong the devious way;
He saw Xaraya's diamond banks unfold,
And Paraguay's deep channel paved with gold,
Saw proud Potosi lift his glittering head,
Whence the clear Plata wears his tinctur'd bed;
Rich with the spoils of many a distant mine,
In one broad silver sea their floods combine;
Wide o'er the realms its annual bounties spread,
By nameless streams from various mountains fed;
The thirsty regions wait its glad return,
And drink their future harvests from its urn.
Round the cold climes, beneath the southern sky,
Thy path, Magellan, caught the hero's eye;
The long cleft ridges oped the widening way
Fair gleaming westward to the Placid Sea
Soon as the distant wave was seen to roll,
His ancient wishes fill'd his rising soul,
Warm from his heaving heart an anxious sigh
Breathed o'er his lips; he turn'd his moisten'd eye,
And thus besought the Angel. Speak, my guide,
Where leads the pass? and whence yon purple tide?
Deep in the blue horizon, widely spread,
What liquid realms in blending ether fade!
How the dim waters skirt the bounds of day!
No lands behind them rise, no streamers in them play
In those low skies extends the boundless main,
I sought so long, and sought, alas, in vain
Restore, celestial Power, my youthful morn,
Call back my years and bid my fame return;
Grant me to trace, beyond that pathless sea,
Some happier shore from lust of empire free;
In that far world to fix a peaceful bower,
From envy safe, and curst Ovando's power
Since joys of mortals claim thy guardian care,
Oh bless the nations and regard my prayer:
There rest forever kingdoms unexplored,
Earth's happiest realms shall endless darkness hide?
And seas forever roll their useless tide?
Grant, heavenly guide, the welcome task to dare,
One venturous bark, and be my life thy care.
The hero spoke; the Seraph mild replies,
While warm compassion soften'd in his eyes;
Though still to virtuous deeds thy mind aspires,
And heavenly visions kindle new desires;
Yet hear with reverence what attends thy state,
Nor pass the confines of eternal fate
Led by this sacred light thy soul shall see,
That half mankind shall owe their bliss to thee,
And joyous empires claim their future birth,
In these fair bounds of sea-encircled earth;
While unborn times, by thine example prest,
Shall call forth heroes to explore the rest
Beyond those seas, the well-known climes arise,
Where morning splendors gild the eastern skies
The circling course to India's happy shores,
Round Afric's coast, bold Gama now explores;
Another pass these opening straits provide,
Nor long shall rest the daring search untry'd;
This watery glade shall open soon to fame,
Here a lost hero fix his lasting name,
From that new main in furious waves be tost,
And fall neglected on the barbarous coast
But see the chief from Albion's strand arise,
Speed in his pinions, fame before his eyes;
Hither, O Drake, display the hastening sails,
Widen ye passes, and awake ye gales,
Move thou before him, heaven-revolving sun,
Wind his long course, and teach him where to run,
Earth's distant shores in circling bands unite,
Lands, learn your fame, and oceans, roll in light,
Round all the beauteous globe his flag be hurl'd,
A new Columbus to the astonish'd world
He spoke; and silent tow'rd the northern sky,
Wide o'er the realms the hero cast his eye;
Saw the long floods pour forth their watery stores,
And wind their currents to the opening shores;
While midland seas and lonely lakes display
Their glittering glories to the beams of day
Thy capes, Virginia, towering from the tide,
Raised up their arms and branch'd their borders wide;
Whose broad embrace in circling extent lay,
Round the calm bosom of thy beauteous bay
Where commerce since has wing'd her channel'd flight
Each spreading stream lay brightening to the light;
York led his wave, imbank'd in mazy pride,
And nobler James fell winding by his side;
Back tow'rd the distant hills, through many a vale,
Wild Rappahanock seem'd to lure the sail,
While, far o'er all, in sea-like azure spread,
The great Potowmac swept his lordly bed.
When thus he saw the mingling waters play,
And seas, in lost disorder, idly stray,
Where frowning forests stretch the dusky wing,
And deadly damps forbid the flowers to spring,
No seasons clothe the field with beauteous grain,
No buoyant ship attempt the useless main,
With fond impatience, Heavenly Seer, he cry'd,
When shall my children cross the lonely tide?
Here, here, my sons, the hand of culture bring,
Here teach the lawns to smile, the groves to sing;
Ye sacred floods, no longer vainly glide,
Ye harvests, load them, and ye forests, ride,
Bear the deep burden from the joyous swain,
And tell the world where peace and plenty reign
Now round the coast, where other floods invite,
He fondly turn'd; they fill'd his eager sight:
Here Del'ware's waves the yielding shores invade,
And here bold Hudson oped a glassy glade;
Thy parent stream, fair Hartford, met his eye,
Far lessening upward to the northern sky;
No watery gleams thro' happier valleys shine,
Nor drinks the sea a lovlier wave than thine
Bright Charles and Mystick laved their bloomy isles,
And gay Piscatuway caught his passing smiles;
Swift Kenebeck, descending from on high,
Swept the tall hills and lengthen'd down the sky;
When hoarse resounding through the gaping shore,
He heard cold Laurence' dreadful surges roar
Tho' softening May had waked the vernal blade,
And happier climes her fragrant garb display'd,
Yet howling winter, in this bleak domain,
Shook the wide waste and held his gloomy reign;
Still groans the flood, in frozen fetters bound,
And isles of ice his threatening front surround,
Clothed in white majesty, the foaming main
Leads up the tide and tempts the wintery chain,
Billows on billows lift the maddening brine,
And seas and clouds in battling conflict join,
The dash'd wave struggling heaves in swelling sweep,
Wide crash the portals of the frozen deep,
Till forced alost, high-bounding in the air,
Moves the blear ice and sheds a hideous glare,
The torn foundations on the surface ride,
And wrecks of winter load the downward tide
When now the stream had oped its northern course,
He traced the current to its milder source;
There, far retired, the Angellic Power displays
Earth's sweetest charms, her own imbosom'd seas
Ontario's banks, fair opening on the north,
With sweep majestic, pour'd his Laurence forth;
Above, bold Erie's wave sublimely stood,
Look'd o'er the cliff and heaved the headlong flood,
Far circling in the north, great Huron spread,
And Michigan o'erwhelm'd a western bed;
While, stretch'd in circling majesty away,
The deep Superior closed the setting day
Here all the midland seas their waves unite,
And gleam in grandeur to the hero's sight;
Wide opening round them lands delightful spread,
Deep groves innumerous cast a solemn shade;
Slow moved the settling mist in lurid streams,
And dusky radiance brown'd the glimmering beams;
O'er all the great Discoverer wondering stood,
And thus address'd the messenger of good
What lonely walks, what wonderous wilds are these?
What branching vales run smiling to their seas?
The peaceful seats, reserved by Heaven to grace,
The virtuous toils of some illustrious race
But why these regions form'd so fair in vain?
And why so distant rolls the unconscious main?
These desert fountains must forever rest,
Of man unseen, by native beasts possest;
For, see, no ship can point the streamer here,
No opening pass, no spreading ocean near;
Eternal winter clothes the shelvy shores,
Where yon far northern son of ocean roars;
Or should some bark the daring entrance brave,
And climes by culture warm his lessening wave,
Yon frightful cataract exalts the brow,
And frowns defiance to the world below.
To whom the Seraph. Here extended lies
The happiest realm that feels the fostering skies;
Led by this arm thy sons shall hither come,
And streams obedient yield the heroes room;
Nor think no pass can find the distant main,
Or heaven's last polish touch'd these climes in vain
Behold, from yon fair lake, the current led,
And silent waves adorn its infant head;
Far south thro' happy regions see it wind,
By gathering floods and nobler fountains join'd,
Yon opening gulph receive the beauteous wave,
And thy known isles its freshening current lave;
There lies the path some future ship shall trace,
And waft to these wide vales thy kindred race
The hero saw the blooming isles ascend
And round the gulph the circling shore extend,
He saw fair Missisippi wind his way,
Through all the western boundless tracts of day;
Where Alleganies stretch the morning shade,
From lone Oswago to the gulphy glade,
Where absent suns their midnight circles ride,
Pours the long current of his rushing tide
Unnumber'd branches from the channel stray,
Akansa here, and there Missouri lay,
Rouge roll'd his wave along the western wild,
And broad Ohio's northern beauties smiled
Retiring far round Hudson's frozen bay,
Where lessening circles shrink beyond the day,
The shivering shrubs scarce brave the dismal clime,
Snows ever-rising with the years of time;
The beasts all whitening roam the lifeless plain,
And caves unfrequent scoop the couch for man
Where Spring's coy steps, in cold Canadia, stray,
And joyless seasons hold unequal sway,
He saw the pine its daring mantle rear,
Break the rude blast and mock the inclement year,
Secure the limits of the angry skies,
And bid all southern vegetation rise
Wild o'er the vast, impenetrable round,
The untrod bowers of shadowy nature frown'd;
The neighbouring cedar waved its honours wide,
The fir's tall boughs, the oak's resistless pride,
The branching beach, the aspin's trembling shade,
Veil'd the dim heavens and brown'd the dusky glade
Here in huge crouds those sturdy sons of earth,
In frosty regions, claim a nobler birth;
Where heavy trunks the sheltering dome requires,
And copious fuel feeds the wintery fires
While warmer suns, that southern climes emblaze,
A cool deep umbrage o'er the woodland raise;
Floridia's blooming shores around him spread,
And Georgian hills erect their shady head;
Beneath tall trees, in livelier verdure gay,
Long level walks a humble garb display;
The infant corn, unconscious of its worth,
Points the green spire and bends the foliage forth;
Sweeten'd on flowery banks, the passing air
Breathes all the untasted fragrance of the year;
Unbidden harvests o'er the regions rise,
And blooming life repays the genial skies.
Where circling shores around the gulph extend,
The bounteous groves with richer burdens bend;
Spontaneous fruits the uplifted palms unfold,
The beauteous orange waves a load of gold,
The untaught vine, the wildly-wanton cane
Bloom on the waste, and clothe the enarbour'd plain,
The rich pimento scents the neighbouring skies,
And woolly clusters o'er the cotton rise
Here, in one view, the same glad branches bring
The fruits of autumn and the flowers of spring;
No wintery blasts the unchanging year deform,
Nor beasts unshelter'd fear the pinching storm;
But vernal breezes o'er the blossoms rove,
And breathe the ripen'd juices thro' the grove
Beneath the crystal wave's inconstant light,
Pearls undistinguish'd sparkle on the sight;
From opening earth, in living lustre, shine
The various treasures of the blazing mine;
Hills, cleft before him, all their stores unfold,
The quick mercurius and the burning gold;
Gems of unnumber'd hues, in bright array,
Illume the changing rocks and shed the beams of day
When now the Chief had travel'd with his eye,
O'er each fair clime that meets the incumbent sky;
The stream, the mountain, forest, vale and plain,
And isle and coast, and wide untravers'd main;
He cast, o'er all, the immeasurable glance,
And all past views in one broad vision dance
Skirting the western heavens and each far pole,
With blending skies Pacific oceans roll,
Atlantic surges lead their swelling round,
And distant straits the polar confines bound
The western coasts their long, high summits heave,
And look majestic o'er the subject wave;
While, on the lowly east, the winding strand
Draws from the silent sea and gently steals to land


High o'er the changing scene, as thus he gazed,
The indulgent Power his arm sublimely raised;
When round the realms superior lustre flew,
And call'd new wonders to the hero's view.
He saw, at once, as far as eye could rove,
Like scattering herds, the swarthy people move,
In tribes innumerable; all the waste,
Beneath their steps, a varying shadow cast.
As airy shapes, beneath the moon's pale eye,
When broken clouds sail o'er the curtain'd sky,
Spread thro' the grove and flit along the glade,
And cast their grisly phantoms thro' the shade;
So move the hordes, in thickers half conceal'd,
Or vagrant stalking o'er the open field.
Here ever-restless tribes, despising home,
O'er shadowy streams and trackless deserts roam;
While others there, thro' downs and hamlets stray,
And rising domes a happier state display.
The painted chiefs, in death's grim terrors drest,
Rise fierce to war, and beat the savage breast;
Dark round their steps collecting warriors pour,
And dire revenge begins the hideous roar;
While to the realms around the signal flies,
And tribes on tribes, in dread disorder, rise,
Track the mute foe and scour the distant wood,
Wide as a storm, and dreadful as a flood;
Now deep in groves the silent ambush lay,
Or wing the flight or sweep the prize away,
Unconscious babes and reverend sires devour,
Drink the warm blood and paint their cheeks with gore.
While all their mazy movements fill the view.
Where'er they turn his eager eyes pursue;
He saw the same dire visage thro' the whole,
And mark'd the same fierce savageness of soul:
In doubt he stood, with anxious thoughts oppress'd,
And thus his wavering mind the Power address'd.
Say, from what source, O Voice of wisdom, sprung
The countless tribes of this amazing throng?
Where human frames and brutal souls combine,
No force can tame them and no arts refine.
Can these be fashion'd on the social plan?
Or boast a lineage with the race of man?
In yon fair isle, when first my wandering view
Ranged the glad coast and met the savage crew;
A timorous herd, like harmless roes, they ran,
Supply'd our various wants, relieved our toil,
And oped the unbounded treasures of their isle.
But when, their fears allay'd, in us they trace
The well-known image of a mortal race;
When Spanish blood their wondering eyes beheld,
Returning rage their changing bosoms swell'd;
Their jaws the crimson dainty long'd to taste,
And spread, with foreign flesh, the rich repast.
My homeward sail, far distant on the main,
Incautious left a small unguarded train,
When, in their horrid power, bereft of aid,
That train with thee, O lost Arada, bled.
No faith no treaty calms their maddening flame,
Rage all their joy, and slaughter all their aim;
How the dread savage bands with fury burn'd,
When o'er the wave our growing host return'd!
Now, mild with joy, a friendly smile they show'd,
And now their dark-red visage frown'd in blood;
Till, call'd afar, from all the circling shore,
Swift thro' the groves the yelling squadrons pour,
The wide wings stretching sweep the unbounded plain,
That groans beneath the innumerable train.
Our scanty files, ascending o'er the strand,
Tread the bold champaign and the fight demand;
With steeds and hounds the dreadful onset moves,
And thundering batteries rend the distant groves;
Swift fly the scattering foes, like shades of night,
When orient splendors urge their rapid flight.
Our proffer'd friendship bade the discord cease,
Spared the grim host and gave the terms of peace.
The arts of civil life we strove to lend,
Their lands to culture and their joys extend,
Sublime their views, fair virtue's charms display,
And point their passage to eternal day.
Still proud to rove, our offers they disdain,
Insult our friendship and our rites prophane.
In that blest island, still the myriads rest,
Bask in the sunshine, wander with the beast,
Feed on the foe, or from the victor fly,
Rise into life, exhaust their rage, and die.
Tell then, my Seer, from what dire sons of earth
The brutal people drew their ancient birth?
Whether in realms, the western heavens that close,
A tribe distinct from other nations rose,
Born to subjection; when, in happier time,
A nobler race should hail their fruitful clime.
Or, if a common source all nations claim,
Their lineage, form, and reasoning powers the same,
What sovereign cause, in secret wisdom laid,
Why various powers of soul and tints of face
In different climes diversify the race?
To whom the Guide; Unnumber'd causes lie
In earth and sea and round the varying sky,
That fire the soul, or damp the genial flame,
And work their wonders on the human frame.
See beauty, form and colour change with place–
Here charms of health the blooming visage grace;
There pale diseases float in every wind,
Deform the figure, and degrade the mind.
From earth's own elements, thy race at first
Rose into life, the children of the dust;
These kindred elements, by various use,
Nourish the growth and every change produce;
Pervade the pores, awake the infant bloom,
Lead life along, and ope the certain tomb;
In each ascending stage the man sustain,
His breath, his food, his physic and his bane.
In due proportions, where these virtues lie,
A perfect form their equal aids supply;
And, while unchanged the efficient causes reign,
Age following age the unvaried race maintain.
But where crude elements distemper'd rise,
And cast their sickening vapours round the skies,
Unlike that harmony of human frame,
The unconscious tribes, attempering to the clime,
Still vary downward with the years of time;
Till fix'd, at last, their characters abide,
And local likeness feeds their local pride.
The soul too varying with the changing clime,
Feeble or fierce, or groveling or sublime,
Forms with the body to a kindred plan,
And lives the same, a nation or a man.
Yet think not clime alone, or height of poles,
On every shore, the springs of life controuls;
A different cast the glowing zone demands,
In Paria's blooms, from Tombut's burning sands.
Internal causes, thro' the earth and skies,
Blow in the breeze or on the mountain rise,
Thro' air and ocean, with their changes run,
Breathe from the ground or circle with the fun.
Where these long shores their boundless regions spread
See the same form all different tribes pervade;
Thro' all, alike, the fertile forests bloom,
And all, uncultured, shed a solemn gloom;
Thro' all great nature's boldest features rise,
Sink into vales and tower amid the skies;
Streams, darkly-winding, stretch a broader sway,
The groves and mountains bolder walks display:
A dread sublimity informs the whole,
And wakes a dread sublimity of soul.
Yet time and art shall other changes find,
And open still and vary still the mind;
The countless swarms that tread these dank abodes,
Who glean spontaneous fruits and range the woods,
Fix'd here for ages, in their swarthy face,
Display the wild complexion of the place.
Yet when their tribes to happy nations rise,
And earth by culture warms the genial skies,
A fairer tint and more majestic grace
Shall flush their features and exalt the race;
While milder arts, with social joys refined,
Inspire new beauties in the growing mind.
Thy followers too, fair Europe's noblest pride,
When future gales shall wing them o'er the tide,
A ruddier hue and deeper shade shall gain,
And stalk, in statelier figures, o'er the plain.
While nature's grandeur lifts the eye abroad
Wing'd on a wider glance the venturous soul
Bids greater powers and bolder thoughts unroll;
The sage, the chief, the patriot, unconfined,
Shield the weak world and counsel for mankind.
But think not thou, in all the race of man,
That different pairs, in different climes, began;
Or tribes distinct, by signal marks confest,
Were born to serve or subjugate the rest.
The hero heard; But say, celestial Guide,
Who led the wanderers o'er the billowy tide?
Could these dark bands, unskill'd the paths to gain,
To build the bark, or cross the extended main,
Descry the coast, or tread the blest abode,
When first thy roving race, the Power reply'd,
Learn'd by the stars the devious sail to guide,
From stormy Hellespont explored the way,
And sought the bound'ries of the midland sea;
Ere great Alcides form'd the impious plan,
To bound the sail and fix the range of man,
Driven from those rocky straits, a hapless train
Roll'd on the waves that sweep the western main,
While eastern storms the billowing skies o'ershade,
Nor sun nor stars afford their wonted aid.
For many a darksome day, o'erwhelm'd and tost,
Their sails, their oars in swallowing surges lost;
At length, the clouds withdrawn, they sad descry
Their course directing from their native sky;
No hope remains; while, o'er the flaming zone,
The winds still bear them with the circling sun;
Till the wild walks of this delightful coast
Receive to lonely seats the suffering host.
The fruitful plains invite their steps to roam,
Renounce their sorrows and forget their home;
Revolving years their ceaseless wanderings led,
And from their sons descending nations spread.
These round the south and middle regions stray,
Where cultured fields their growing arts display;
While northern tribes a later source demand,
And snow their wanderers from the Asian strand.
Far tow'rd the distant pole thy view extend;
See isles and shores and seas Pacific blend;
And that blue coast, where Amur's currents glide,
From thy own world a narrow frith divide;
There Tartar hosts for countless years, have sail'd,
And changing tribes the alternate regions hail'd.
He look'd: the opening shores beneath him spread,
And moving nations on the margin tread.
As, when autumnal storms awake their force,
The storks foreboding tempt their southern course;
From all the fields collecting throngs arise,
Mount on the wing and croud along the skies;
Thus, to his eye, from far Siberia's shore,
O'er isles and seas, the gathering people pour;
From those cold regions hail a happier strand,
Leap from the wave and tread the welcome land;
The growing tribes extend their southern sway,
And widely wander to a milder day.
But why; the chief return'd, if ages past
Have led these vagrants o'er the wilder'd waste–
If human souls, for social compact given,
Inform their nature with the stamp of heaven,
Why the dread glooms forever must they rove?
And no mild joys their temper'd passions move?
Ages remote and dark thou bring'st to light,
When the first leaders dared the western flight;
On other shores, in every eastern clime,
Since that unletter'd, distant tract of time,
What arts have shone! what empires found their place,
What golden sceptres sway'd the human race!
What guilt and grandeur from their seats been hurl'd,
And dire divulsions shook the changing world.
Ere Rome's bold eagle clave the affrighted air,
Ere Sparta form'd her death-like sons of war,
Ere proud Chaldea saw her greatness rise,
Or Memphian columns heaved against the skies;
These tribes have stray'd beneath the fruitful zone,
Their souls unpolish'd and their name unknown.
The Voice of heaven reply'd; A scanty band,
In that far age, approach'd the untrodden land.
Prolific wilds, with game and fruitage crown'd,
Supply'd their wishes from the uncultured ground.
By nature form'd to rove, the restless mind,
Of freedom fond, will ramble unconfined,
Till all the realm is fill'd, and rival right
Restrains their steps, and bids their force unite;
When common safety builds a common cause,
Conforms their interests and inspires their laws;
By mutual checks their different manners blend,
Their fields bloom joyous and their walls ascend.
Here, to their growing hosts, no bounds arose,
They claim'd no safeguard, as they fear'd no foes;
Round all the land their scattering sons must stray,
Ere arts could rise, or power extend the sway.
And what a world their mazy wanderings led!
What streams and wilds in boundless order spread!
See the shores lengthen, see the waters roll,
To each far main and each extended pole!
Yet circling years the destined course have run,
The realms are peopled and their arts begun.
Behold, where that mid region strikes the eyes,
A few fair cities glitter to the skies;
There move, in eastern pomp, the scenes of state,
And temples heave, magnificently great.
The hero look'd; when from the varying height,
Three growing splendors, rising on the sight,
Flamed like a constellation: high in view,
Ascending near, their opening glories drew;
In equal pomp, beneath their roofs of gold,
Three spiry towns, in blazing pride, unfold.
The sacred Seer, in Patmos' waste who trod,
Saw the dim vault of heaven its folds unbend,
And gates and spires and streets and domes descend;
With golden skies, and suns and rainbows crown'd,
The new-form'd city lights the world around.
Fair on the north, bright Mexico, arose,
A mimic morn her sparkling towers disclose,
An ample range the opening streets display,
Give back the sun and shed internal day;
The circling wall with sky-built turrets frown'd,
And look'd defiance to the realms around;
A glimmering lake, without the walls, retires,
Inverts the trembling towers and seems a grove of spires.
Bright, o'er the midst, on columns lifted high,
A rising structure claims a loftier sky;
O'er the tall gates sublimer arches bend,
Courts larger lengthen, bolder walks ascend,
Starr'd with superior gems, the porches shine,
And speak the royal residence within.
There, robed in state, high on a golden throne,
Mid suppliant kings, dread Montezuma shone:
Mild in his eye a temper'd grandeur sate,
Great seem'd his soul, with conscious power elate;
In aspect open, haughty and sincere,
Untamed by crosses and unknown to fear,
Of fraud incautious, credulous and vain,
Enclosed with favourites and of friends unseen.
Round the rich throne, with various lustre bright,
Gems undistinguish'd, cast a changing light;
Sapphires and emeralds deck the splendent scene,
Sky-tinctures mingling with the vernal green;
The ruby's blush, the amber's flames unfold,
And diamonds brighten from the burning gold;
Through all the dome the living blazes blend,
And cast their rainbows where the arches bend.
Wide round the walls, with mimic action gay,
In order ranged, historic figures stray,
And show, in Memphian style, with rival grace,
Their boasted chiefs and all their regal race.
Thro' the full gates, and round each ample street,
Unnumber'd throngs, in various concourse, meet,
Ply different toils, new walls and structures rear,
Or till the fields, or train the ranks of war.
Thro' spreading realms the skirts of empire bend,
New temples rise and other plains extend;
Thrice ten fair provinces, in culture gay,
Bless the same monarch and enlarge his sway.
A smile benignant kindling in his eyes,
Oh happy clime! the exulting hero cries;
Far in the midland, safe from foreign foes,
Thy joys shall ripen as thy grandeur grows,
To future years thy rising fame extend,
And sires of nations from thy sons descend.
May no gold-thirsty race thy temples tread,
Nor stain thy streams nor heap thy plains with dead;
No Bovadilla sieze the tempting spoil,
Ovando dark, or sacrilegious Boyle,
In mimic priesthood grave, or robed in state,
O'erwhelm thy glories in oblivious fate.
Vain are thy fondest hopes, the Power reply'd,
These rich abodes from ravening hosts to hide;
Teach harden'd guilt and cruelty to spare
The guardless prize, and check the waste of war.
Think not the vulture, o'er the field of slain,
Where base and brave promiscuous strow the plain,
Where the young hero, in the pride of charms,
Pours deeper crimson o'er his spotless arms,
Will pass the tempting prey, and glut his rage
On harder flesh, and carnage black with age;
O'er all alike he darts his eager eye,
Whets the dire beak and hovers down the sky,
From countless corses picks the dainty food,
And screams and fattens in the purest blood.
So the dire hosts, that trace thy daring way,
By gold allured to sail the unfathom'd sea,
Power all their aim and avarice all their joy,
Seize brightest realms and happiest tribes destroy.
Thine the dread task, O Cortez, here to show
What unknown crimes can heighten human woe,
On these fair fields the blood of realms to pour,
Tread sceptres down and print thy steps in gore,
With gold and carnage swell thy sateless mind,
And live and die the blackest of mankind.
Now see, from yon fair isle, his murdering band
Stream o'er the wave and mount the sated strand;
On the wild shore behold his fortress rise,
The fleet in flames ascends the darken'd skies.
The march begins; the nations, from afar,
Quake in his sight, and wage the fruitless war;
O'er the rich provinces he bends his way,
Kings in his chain, and kingdoms for his prey;
While, robed in peace, great Montezuma stands,
And crowns and treasures sparkle in his hands,
Proffers the empire, yields the sceptred sway,
Bids vassal'd millions tremble and obey;
And plies the victor, with incessant prayer,
Thro' ravaged realms the harmless race to spare.
But prayers and tears and sceptres plead in vain,
Nor threats can move him, nor a world restrain;
While blest religion's prostituted name,
And monkish fury guides the sacred flame:
O'er fanes and altars, fires unhallow'd bend,
Climb o'er the walls and up the towers ascend,
Pour, round the lowering skies, the smoky flood,
And whelm the fields, and quench their rage in blood.
The hero heard; and, with a heaving sigh,
Dropp'd the full tear that started in his eye,
Oh hapless day! his trembling voice reply'd,
That saw my wandering streamer mount the tide!
Oh! had the lamp of heaven, to that bold fail,
Ne'er mark'd the passage nor awaked the gale,
Taught eastern worlds these beauteous climes to find,
Nor led those tygers forth to curse mankind.
Then had the tribes, beneath these bounteous skies,
Seen their walls widen and their spires arise;
Down the long tracts of time their glory shone,
Broad as the day and lasting as the sun:
The growing realms, beneath thy shield that rest,
O hapless monarch, still thy power had blest,
Enjoy'd the pleasures that surround thy throne,
Survey'd thy virtues and sublimed their own.
Forgive me, prince; this impious arm hath led
The unseen storm that blackens o'er thy head;
Taught the dark sons of slaughter where to roam,
To seize thy crown and seal thy nation's doom.
Arm, sleeping empire, meet the daring band,
Drive back the terrors, save the sinking land–
Yet vain the strife! behold the sweeping flood!
Thus, from his heart, while speaking sorrows roll,
The Power, reproving, sooth'd his tender soul.
Father of this new world, thy tears give o'er,
Let virtue grieve and Heaven be blamed no more.
Enough for man, with persevering mind,
To act his part and strive to bless his kind;
Enough for thee, o'er thy dark age to rise,
With genius warm'd, and favour'd of the skies.
For this my guardian care thy youth inspired,
To virtue raised thee, and with glory fired,
Bade in thy plan each distant world unite,
And wing'd thy streamer for the adventurous flight.
Nor think no blessings shall thy toils attend,
Or these fell tyrants can defeat their end.
Such impious deeds, in Heaven's all-ruling plan,
Lead in disguise the noblest bliss of man.
Long have thy race, to narrow shores confined,
Trod the same round that cramp'd the roving mind;
Now, borne on bolder wings, with happier flight,
The world's broad bounds unfolding to the sight,
The mind shall soar; the nations catch the flame,
Enlarge their counsels and extend their fame;
While mutualities the social joys enhance,
And the last stage of civil rule advance.
Tho' impious ruffians spread their crimes abroad,
And o'er these empires pour the purple flood;
Tis thus religious rage, its own dire bane,
Shall fall at last, with all its millions slain,
And buried gold, drawn bounteous from the mine,
Give wings to commerce and the world refine.
Now to yon southern walls extend thy view,
And mark the rival seats of rich Peru.
There Quito's airy plains, exalted high,
With loftier temples rise along the sky;
And elder Cusco's richer roofs unfold,
Flame on the day and shed their suns of gold.
Another range, in these delightful climes,
Spreads a broad theatre for unborn crimes.
Another Cortez shall the treasures view,
The rage rekindle and the guilt renew;
His treason, fraud, and every dire decree,
O curst Pizarro, shall revive in thee.
There reigns a prince, whose hand the sceptre claims,
Thro' a long lineage of imperial names;
Where the brave roll of following Incas trace
The distant father of their realm and race,
Immortal Capac. He in youthful pride,
With fair Oella, his illustrious bride,
In virtuous guile, proclaim'd their birth begun,
With power and dignity a throne to found,
Fix the mild sway and spread their arts around;
And point all worship to a nobler name;
With cheerful rites, the due devotions pay
To the bright beam, that gives the changing day.
On this fair plan, the children of the skies
Bade, in the wild, a growing empire rise;
Beneath their hand, and sacred to their fame,
Rose yon fair walls, that meet the solar flame.
Succeeding sovereigns spread their bounds afar,
By arts of peace and temper'd force of war;
Till these surrounding realms the sceptre own,
And grateful millions hail the genial sun.
Behold, in yon fair lake, a beauteous isle,
Where fruits and flowers, in rich profusion smile;
High in the midst a sacred temple rise,
Seat of the sun, and pillar of the skies.
The roofs of burnish'd gold, the blazing spires
Light the glad heavens and lose their upward fires;
Fix'd in the flaming front, with living ray,
A diamond circlet gives the rival day;
In whose bright face forever looks abroad
Round the wide courts, and in the solemn dome,
A white-robed train of holy virgins bloom;
Their pious hands the sacred rites require,
To grace the offerings, and preserve the fire.
On this blest isle, with flowery garlands crown'd,
That ancient pair, in charms of youth, were found,
Whose union'd souls the mighty plan design'd,
To bless the nations and reform mankind.
The hero heard, and thus the Power besought;
What arts unknown the wonderous blessings wrought?
What human skill, in that benighted age,
In savage souls could quell the barbarous rage?
With leagues of peace combine the wide domain?
And teach the virtues in their laws to reign?
Long is their story, said the Power divine,
The labours great and glorious the design;
And tho' to earthly minds, their actions rest,
By years obscured, in flowery fiction drest,
Yet my glad voice shall wake their honour'd name,
And give their virtues to immortal fame.
Led by his father's wars, in early prime,
Young Capac wander'd from a northern clime;
Along these shores, with livelier verdure gay,
Thro' fertile vales, the adventurous armies stray.
He saw the tribes unnumber'd range the plain,
And rival chiefs, by rage and slaughter, reign;
Their altars staining with their children's gore;
Yet mark'd their reverence for the Sun, whose beam
Proclaims his bounties and his power supreme;
Who sails in happier skies, diffusing good,
Demands no victim and receives no blood.
In peace returning with his conquering sire,
Fair glory's charms his youthful soul inspire;
With virtue warm'd, he fix'd the generous plan,
To build his greatness on the bliss of man.
By nature formed to daring deeds of fame,
Tall, bold and beauteous rose his stately frame;
Strong moved his limbs, a mild majestic grace
Beam'd from his eyes and open'd in his face;
O'er the dark world his mind superior shone,
And, soaring, seem'd the semblance of the sun.
Now fame's prophetic visions lift his eyes,
And future empires from his labours rise;
Yet softer fires his daring views controul,
Sway the warm wish and fill the changing soul.
Shall the bright genius, kindled from above,
Bend to the milder, gentler voice of love;
That bounds his glories, and forbids to part
From that calm bower, that held his glowing heart?
Or shall the toils, imperial heroes claim,
Fire his bold bosom with a patriot flame?
Bid sceptres wait him on the distant shore?
And blest Oella meet his eyes no more?
Retiring pensive, near the wonted shade,
His unseen steps approach the beauteous maid.
Her raven-locks roll on her heaving breast,
And wave luxuriant round her slender waist,
Gay wreaths of flowers her lovely brows adorn,
And her white raiment mocks the pride of morn.
Her busy hand sustains a bending bough,
Where woolly clusters spread their robes of snow,
From opening pods, unbinds the fleecy store,
And culls her labours for the evening bower.
Her sprightly soul, by deep invention led,
Had found the skill to turn the twisting thread,
To spread the woof, the shuttle to command,
Till various garments graced her forming hand.
Here, while her thoughts with her own Capac rove,
O'er former scenes of innocence and love,
Through many a field his fancied dangers share,
And wait him glorious from the distant war;
Blest with the ardent wish, her glowing mind
A snowy vesture for the prince design'd;
She seeks the purest wool, to web the fleece,
The sacred emblem of returning peace.
Sudden his near approach her breast alarms;
He flew enraptured to her yielding arms,
And lost, dissolving in a softer name,
The distant empire and the fire of fame.
At length, retiring o'er the homeward field,
Their mutual minds to happy converse yield,
O'er various scenes of blissful life they ran,
When thus the warrior to the fair began.
Joy of my life, thou know'st my roving mind,
With these grim tribes, in dark abodes, confined,
With grief hath mark'd what vengeful passions sway
The bickering bands, and sweep the race away.
Where late my distant steps the war pursued,
The fertile plains grew boundless as I view'd;
Increasing nations trod the waving wild,
And joyous nature more delightful smiled.
No changing seasons there the flowers deform,
No dread volcano, and no mountain storm;
Rains ne'er invade, nor livid lightnings play,
Nor clouds obscure the radiant Power of day.
Rolls o'er the day and fires his stars by night,
Unbounded fulness flows beneath his reign,
Seas yield their treasures, fruits adorn the plain;
Warm'd by his beam, their mountains pour the flood,
My anxious thoughts indulge the great design,
To form those nations to a sway divine;
Destroy the rights of every dreadful Power,
Whose crimson altars glow with human gore;
To laws and mildness teach the realms to yield,
And nobler fruits to grace the cultured field.
But great, my charmer, is the task of fame,
The countless tribes to temper and to tame.
Full many a spacious wild my soul must see,
Spread dreary bounds between my joys and me;
Each lonely evening number'd with a tear.
Long robes of white my shoulders must embrace,.
To speak my lineage of ethereal race;
That wondering tribes may tremble, and obey
The radiant offspring of the Power of day.
And when thro' cultured fields their bowers encrease,
And streams and plains survey the works of peace,
When these glad hands the rod of nations claim,
And happy millions bless thy Capac's name,
Then shall he feign a journey to the Sun,
To bring the partner of the peaceful throne;
So shall descending kings the line sustain,
And unborn ages bloom beneath their reign.
Will then my fair, in that delightful hour,
Forsake these wilds and hail a happier bower?
And now consenting, with approving smiles,
Bid the young warrior tempt the daring toils?
And, sweetly patient, wait the flight of days,
That crown our labours with immortal praise?
Silent the fair one heard; her moistening eye
Spoke the full soul, nor could her voice reply;
Till softer accents sooth'd her listening ear,
Composed her tumult and allay'd her fear.
Think not, enchanting maid, my steps would part,
While silent sorrows heave that tender heart:
More dear to me are blest Oella's joys,
Than all the lands that bound the bending skies;
Nor thou, bright Sun, should'st bribe my soul to rest,
And leave one struggle in her lovely breast.
Yet think in those vast climes, my gentle fair,
What hapless millions claim our guardian care;
How age to age leads on the dreadful gloom,
And rage and slaughter croud the untimely tomb;
No social joys their wayward passions prove,
Nor peace nor pleasure treads the savage grove;
Mid thousand heroes and a thousand fair,
No fond Oella meets her Capac there.
Yet, taught by thee each nobler joy to prize,
With softer charms the virgin race shall rise,
Awake new virtues, every grace improve,
And form their minds for happiness and love.
Behold, where future years, in pomp, descend,
How worlds and ages on thy voice depend!
And, like the Sun, whose all-delighting ray
O'er those mild borders sheds serenest day,
Diffuse thy bounties, give my steps to rove,
A few short months the noble task to prove,
And, swift return'd from glorious toils, declare
What realms submissive wait our fostering care.
And will my prince, my Capac, borne away,
Thro' those dark wilds, in quest of empire, stray?
Where tygers fierce command the howling wood,
And men like tygers thirst for human blood.
Think'st thou no dangerous deed the course attends?
Alone, unaided by thy sire and friends?
Even chains and death may meet my rover there,
Nor his last groan could reach Oella's ear.
But chains, nor death, nor groans shall Capac prove,
Unknown to her, while she has power to rove.
Close by thy side where'er thy wanderings stray,
My equal steps shall measure all the way;
With borrow'd soul each dire event I'll dare,
Thy toils to lessen and thy dangers share.
Command, blest chief, since virtue bids thee go
To rule the realms and banish human woe,
Command these hands two snowy robes to weave,
The Sun to mimic and the tribes deceive;
Then let us range, and spread the peaceful sway,
The radiant children of the Power of day.
The lovely counsel pleased. The smiling chief
Approved her courage and dispel'd her grief;
Then to the distant bower in haste they move,
Begin their labours and prepare to rove.
Soon grow the robes beneath her forming care,
And the fond parents wed the noble pair;
But, whelm'd in grief, beheld, the approaching dawn,
Their joys all vanish'd, and their children gone.
Nine changing days, thro' southern wilds, they stray'd,
Now wrapp'd in glooms, now gleaming thro' the glade,
Till the tenth morning, with an orient smile,
Beheld them blooming in the happy isle.
The toil begins; to every neighbouring band,
They speak the message and their faith demand;
With various art superior powers display,
To prove their lineage and confirm their sway.
The astonish'd tribes behold with glad surprize,
Adore their persons, robed in shining white,
Receive their laws and leave each horrid rite;
Build with assisting toil, the golden throne,
And hail and bless the sceptre of the Sun. 

Now, twice twelve years, the children of the skies
Beheld in peace their growing empire rise;
O'er happy realms, display'd their generous care,
Diffused their arts and soothd the rage of war;
Bade yon tall temple grace the favourite isle.
The gardens bloom, the cultured valleys smile,
The aspiring hills their spacious mines unfold.
Fair structures blaze, and altars burn, in gold,
Those broad foundations bend their arches high,
And heave imperial Cusco to the sky;
From that fair stream that mark'd their northern sway,
Where Apurimac leads his lucid way,
To yon far glimmering lake, the southern bound,
The growing tribes their peaceful dwellings found;
While wealth and grandeur bless'd the extended reign,
From the bold Andes to the western main.
When, fierce from eastern wilds, the savage bands
Lead war and slaughter o'er the happy lands;
Thro' fertile fields the paths of culture trace,
And vow destruction to the Incan race.
While various fortune strow'd the embattled plain,
And baffled thousands still the strife maintain,
The unconquer'd Inca wakes the lingering war,
Drives back their host and speeds their flight afar;
Till, fired with rage, they range the wonted wood,
And feast their souls on future scenes of blood.
Where yon blue summits hang their cliffs on high;
Frown o'er the plains and lengthen round the sky;
Where vales exalted thro' the breaches run;
And drink the nearer splendors of the sun,
From south to north, the tribes innumerous wind,
By hills of ice and mountain streams confined;
Rouse neighbouring hosts, and meditate the blow,
To blend their force and whelm the world below.
Capac, with caution, views the dark design,
From countless wilds what hostile myriads join;
And greatly strives to bid the discord cease,
By profferd compacts of perpetual peace.
His eldest hope, young Rocha, at his call,
Leaves the deep confines of the temple wall;
In whose fair form, in lucid garments drest,
Began the sacred function of the priest.
In early youth, ere yet the genial sun
Had twice six changes o'er his childhood run,
The blooming prince, beneath his parents' hand,
Learn'd all the laws that sway'd the sacred land;
With rites mysterious served the Power divine,
Prepared the altar and adorn'd the shrine,
Responsive hail'd, with still returning praise,
Sooth'd with funereal hymns the parting dead,
At nuptial feasts the joyful chorus led;
While evening incense and the morning song
Rose from his hand or trembled on his tongue.
Thus, form'd for empire, ere he gain'd the sway;
To rule with reverence and with power obey,
Reflect the glories of the parent Sun,
And shine the Capac of his future throne,
Employ'd his ripening years; till now, from far,
The distant fields proclaim approaching war;
Inspired for active scenes he quits the shrine,
To aid the council or in arms to shine.
Where the mild monarch courtly throngs enclose,
Sublime in modest majesty he rose,
With reverence bow'd, conspicuous o'er the rest,
Approach'd the throne and thus the sire address'd:
Great king of nations, heaven-descended sage,
Guard of my youth and glory of my age,
These pontiff robes, to my blest brother's hand
Glad I resign, and wait thy kind command.
Should war invade, permit thy son to wield
The shaft of vengeance through the untempted field:
Led by thy powerful arm, my soul shall brave
The haughtiest foe, or find a glorious grave;
While our bold ranks a nobler toil demand,
In one dread field o'erwhelm the brutal band,
Pour to the mountain gods their wonted food,
And shield thy realms from future scenes of blood.
Yet oh, may sovereign mercy first ordain
Propounded compact to the savage train.
Fearless of foes, their own dark wilds I'll trace,
To quell the rage and give the terms of peace,
Teach the grim race to bow beneath thy sway,
And taste the blessings of the Power of day.
The sire return'd; My earliest wish you know,
To shield from slaughter and preserve the foe,
In bands of mutual peace all tribes to bind,
And live the friend and guardian of mankind.
Should strife begin, thy youthful arm shall share,
The toils of glory through the walks of war;
But o'er those hideous hills, thro' climes of snow,
With reason's voice to lure the savage foe,
To 'scape their snares, their jarring souls combine,
Claims hardier limbs and riper years than thine.
Yet one of heavenly race the task requires,
Whose mystic rites controul the ethereal fires;
His sway on earth and empire of the skies.
Some veteran chief, in those rough labours try'd,
Shall aid the toil, and go thy faithful guide;
O'er dreary heights thy sinking limbs sustain,
Teach the dark wiles of each insidious train,
Through all extremes of life thy voice attend,
In counsel lead thee or in arms defend.
While three firm youths, thy chosen friends, shall go
To learn the climes and meditate the foe;
That wars of future years their aid may find,
To serve the realm and save the savage kind.
Rise then, my son, bright partner of my fame,
With early toils to build thy sacred name;
In high behest, these heavenly tidings bear,
To bless mankind and ward the waste of war.
To those dark hosts, where shivering mountains run,
Proclaim the bounties of our sire the Sun.
On these fair plains, beneath his happier skies,
Tell how his fruits in boundless plenty rise;
How the bright Power, whose all delighting soul
Taught round the courts of heaven his stars to roll,
To all his earth-born sons hath kindly given
His noblest laws the favourite grace of heaven;
Bids every tribe the same glad laws attend,
His realms to widen and his fanes defend,
Confess and emulate his bounteous sway,
And give his blessings where he gives the day.
Yet, should the gathering legions still prepare
The shaft of slaughter for the barbarous war,
Tell them we know to tread the crimson plain,
And heaven's bright children never yield to man.
But oh, my child, with steps of caution go,
The ways are hideous and enraged the foe;
Blood stains their altars, all their feasts are blood,
Tygers and vultures, storms and earthquakes share
Their rites of worship and their spoils of war.
Should'st thou, my Rocha, tempt their vengeful ire,
Should those dear relics feed a savage fire,
Deep sighs would heave thy wretched mother's breast,
The pale sun sink in clouds of darkness drest,
Thy sire and hapless nations rue the day,
That drew thy steps from these sad walls away.
Yet go; 'tis virtue calls; and realms unknown,
By these long toils, may bless thy future throne;
Millions of unborn souls in time may see
Their doom reversed, and owe their joys to thee;
While savage sires, with murdering hands, no more
But, sway'd by happier sceptres, here behold
The rites of freedom and the shrines of gold.
Be wise, be mindful of thy realm and throne;
Heaven speed the labours, and preserve my son.
Soon the glad prince, in robes of white array'd,
Call'd his attendants, and the sire obey'd.
A diamond broad, in burning gold imprest,
Fix'd the Sun's image on his royal breast;
Fair in his hand appear'd the olive bough,
And the white lautu graced his beauteous brow.
Swift o'er the hills that lift the walks of day,
Thro' parting clouds he took his eastern way;
Height over height he gain'd, beyond the bound,
Where the wide empire claims its utmost round;
To numerous tribes proclaim'd the solar sway,
And held, through various toils, his wilder'd way.
At length, far distant, thro' the darkening skies,
Where hills o'er hills in rude disorder rise,
A dreadful groan, beneath the shuddering ground,
Rolls down the steeps and shakes the world around.
Columns of reddening smoke, above the height,
O'ercast the heavens and cloud their wonted light;
From tottering tops descend the cliffs of snow,
The mountains reel, the valleys rend below,
The headlong streams forget their usual round,
And shrink and vanish in the gaping ground;
The sun descends–Wide flames with livid glare
Break the red cloud and purple all the air;
Above the gaping top, wild cinders, driven,
Stream high and brighten to the midst of heaven;
Deep from beneath, full floods of boiling ore
Burst the dread mount, and thro' the opening roar;
Torrents of molten rocks, on every side,
Lead o'er the shelves of ice the fiery tide;
Hills slide before them, skies around them burn,
Towns sink beneath, and heaving plains o'erturn;
O'er distant realms, the flaming deluge, hurl'd,
Sweeps trembling nations from the astonish'd world.
Meanwhile, at distance, through the livid light,
A busy concourse met his wondering sight;
The prince drew near; an altar raised he view'd,
In form a furnace, fill'd with burning wood;
There a fair youth in pangs expiring lay,
And the fond father thus was heard to pray.
Receive, O dreadful Power, from feeble age,
This last pure offering to thy sateless rage,
Thrice has thy vengeance, on this hated land,
Claim'd a dear infant from my yielding hand;
Thrice have those lovely lips the victim press'd,
And all the mother torn that tender breast;
When the dread duty stifled every sigh,
And not a tear escaped her beauteous eye.
The fourth, and last now meets the fatal doom,
Attend, once more, thou dark, infernal Name,
From yon far-streaming pyramid of flame;
Snatch, from the heaving flesh, the expiring breath,
Sacred to thee and all the Powers of death;
Then, in thy hall, with spoils of nations crown'd,
Confine thy walks beneath the rending ground;
No more on earth the imbowel'd flames to pour,
And scourge my people and my race no more.
Thus Rocha heard; and, tow'rd th'trembling croud,
The afflicted chief, with fear and grief opprest,
Beheld the sign and thus the prince address'd.
From what far land, O royal stranger, say,
Ascend thy wandering steps this nightly way?
Com'st thou from plains like ours, with cinders fired?
And have thy people in the flames expired?
Or hast thou now, to stay the whelming flood,
From happier lands I came, the prince return'd,
Where no red vengeance e'er the concave burn'd;
Nor yield our hands the bloody sacrifice.
But life and joy the Power delights to give,
And bids his children but rejoice and live.
Thou seest o'er heaven the all-delighting Sun.
In living radiance, rear his golden throne;
O'er plains and valleys shed his genial beams,
Call from yon cliffs of ice the winding streams;
While fruits and flowers adorn the indulgent field,
And seas and lakes their copious treasures yield;
The friend, the father of our happy race.
Late the lone tribes, on those delightful shores,
With gloomy reverence served imagin'd Powers;
Till he, in pity to the roving race,
Dispensed their laws, and form'd their minds for peace.
My heaven-born parents first the reign began,
Sent from his courts to rule the race of man,
Unfold his arts, extend his bounteous sway,
And give his blessings where he gives the day.
The wondering chief reply'd; thy form and dress
Proclaim thy lineage of superior race;
And our far-distant sires, no less than thine,
From that ethereal mount, the source of flame,
In elder times, the great avengers came;
Where the dread Power conceals his dark abode,
This victim due when willing mortals pay,
His terrors lessen and his fires decay;
While purer sleet regales the untainted air,
And our glad hosts are fired for fiercer war.
Yet know, dread chief, the pious youth rejoin'd,
One sovereign Power produced all human kind;
Some Sire supreme, whose ever-ruling soul
Creates, preserves, and regulates the whole.
That Sire supreme must lift his radiant eye
Round the wide concave of the boundless sky;
That heaven's high courts, and all the walks of men
May rise unveil'd beneath his careful ken.
Could thy dark Power, that holds his drear abode
Deep in the bosom of that fiery flood,
Yield the glad fruits that distant nations find?
Or praise, or punish, or behold mankind?
Shall gild his chambers with the morning light,
By mystic rites he'll vindicate his throne,
And own thy servant for his duteous son.
Meantime, the chief reply'd, thy cares released,
Share the poor relics of our scanty feast;
Which, driven in hasty rout our train supply'd,
When trembling earth proclaim'd the boiling tide.
They fared, they rested; till approaching morn
Beheld the day-star o'er the mountain burn;
The rising prince an altar rear'd on high.
And watch'd the splendors of the orient sky.
When o'er the mountain flamed the sun's broad ray,
He call'd the host his sacred rites t'essay;
Then took the loaves of maize, the bounties brake,
Gave to the chief and bade them all partake;
The hallowed relics on the pile he placed,
With tufts of flowers the simple offering graced,
Held to the sun the image from his breast,
O'er the dry'd leaves, the trembling lustre flies,
And thus his voice ascends the listening skies.
O thou, whose splendors kindle heaven with fire,
Great soul of nature, and the world's dread sire,
If e'er my father found thy sovereign grace,
Or thy blest will ordain'd the Incan race,
Give these lone tribes to learn thine awful name,
Receive this offering and the pile inflame:
So shall thy laws o'er these wide bounds be known,
And earth's unnumber'd sons be happy as thine own.
Thus pray'd the prince, the kindling flames aspire,
The tribes surrounding tremble and retire,
Gaze on the wonder, full conviction own,
And vow obedience to the genial Sun.
The Inca now his farther course descry'd,
A young cazique attending as a guide,
O'er eastern cliffs pursued the wilder'd way,
Where loftier champaigns meet the shivering day;
Saw timorous tribes in these sublime abodes,
Each blackening cloud, that thunders thro' the skies,
Claims from their hands a human sacrifice.
A while the youth, their better faith to gain,
Strives, with his usual art, but strives in vain;
In vain he pleads the mildness of the sun,
In those cold bounds where chilling whirlwinds run;
Where the dark tempests sweep the world below,
And load the mountains with eternal snow.
The sun's bright beam, the fearful tribes declare,
Drives all their evils on the tortured air;
He draws the vapors up the eastern sky,
That sail and centre tow'rd his dazzling eye;
Leads the loud storms along his midday course,
And bids the Andes meet their sweeping force;
Builds their bleak summits, with an icy throne,
To shine through heaven a semblance of his own;
Hence the dire chills, the lifted lawns that wait,
And all the scourges that attend their state,
Seven toilsome days, the virtuous legate strove,
To social joys their savage minds to move;
Then, while the morning glow'd serenely bright,
He led their footsteps to an eastern height;
The world unbounded, stretch'd beneath them, lay,
And not a cloud obscured the rising day.
Broad Amazonia, with her star-like streams,
In azure drest, a heaven inverted seems:
Dim Paraguay extends the aching sight;
Xaraya glimmers, like the moon of night:
The earth and skies, in blending borders, stray,
And smile and brighten to the lamp of day.
When thus the prince; What majesty divine!
What robes of gold! what flames around him shine!
Draw their dim veil, and shrink behind the sky;
Earth with surrounding nature's born anew,
And tribes and empires greet the gladdening view
Who can behold his all-delighting soul
Give life and joy; and heaven and earth controul?
Bid death and darkness from his presence move–
Who can behold, and not adore and love?
Those plains, immensely circling feel his beams,
He greens the groves, he silvers o'er the streams,
Swells the wild fruitage, gives the beast his food,
But nobler joys his righteous laws impart,
To aid the life and mould the social heart,
His peaceful arts o'er happy realms to spread,
And altars grace with pure celestial bread;
Such our distinguish'd lot, who own his sway,
Mild as his morning stars, and liberal as the day.
His unknown laws, the mountain chief reply'd,
In your far world, your boasted race may guide;
And yon low plains, that drink his genial ray,
At his glad shrine their just devotions pay,
But we, nor fear his frown, nor trust his smile;
He blasts our forests and o'erturns our toil;
Our bowers are bury'd in his whirls of snow,
Or swept and driven to shade his tribes below.
Even now his mounting steps thy hopes beguile;
He lures thy raptures with a morning smile
But soon (for so those saffron robes proclaim)
Black storms shall sail beneath his leading flame,
Thunders and blasts, against the mountain driven,
Shall shake the tottering tops and rend the vault of heaven.
He spoke; they waited, till the ascending ray,
High from the noon-tide, shot the faithless day;
When, lo! far-gathering, round the eastern skies
Solemn, and low, the dark-red vapors rise;
Full clouds convolving on the turbid air,
Move, like an ocean to the watery war.
The host, securely raised, no dangers harm,
They sit unclouded, and over-look the storm;
While, far beneath, the sky-borne waters ride,
O'er the dark deep and up the mountain's side;
The lightning's glancing wings, in fury curl'd,
Bend their long forky terrors o'er the world;
Torrents and broken craggs, and floods of rain,
From steep to steep, roll down their force amain,
In dreadful cataracts: the crashing sound
Fills the wide heavens and rocks the smouldering ground.
The blasts, unburden'd, take their upward course.
And, o'er the mountain-top, resume their force:
Swift, thro' the long, white ridges, from the north.
The rapid whirlwinds lead their terrors forth;
High rolls the storm, the circling surges rise,
And wild gyrations wheel the hovering skies;
Vast hills of snow, in sweeping columns driven,
Deluge the air and cloud the face of heaven;
Floods burst their chains, the rocks forget their place,
And the firm mountain trembles to its base.
Long gazed the host; when thus the stubborn chief,
With eyes on fire, and fill'd with sullen grief,
Laughs at our woes, and sails the heavens in joy;
Drives all his evils on these seats sublime,
And wafts his favours to a happier clime:
Sire of that peaceful race, thy words disclose,
There glads his children, here afflicts his foes.
Hence! speed thy course! pursue him where he leads;
Lest vengeance seize thee for thy father's deeds,
Thy immolated limbs asswage the fire
Of those curst Powers, which now a gift require.
The youth, in haste, collects his scanty train,
And, with the sun, flies o'er the western plain,
The fading orb with plaintive voice he plies,
To guide his steps and light him down the skies.
So, when the moon and all the host of even,
Hang, pale and trembling, on the verge of heaven,
While storms, ascending, threat their nightly reign,
They seek their absent sire, and settle down the main.
Now, to the south, he turns his tedious way,
Where tribes unnumber'd on the mountains stray;
And finds, collecting, in a central plain,
From all the hills, a wide-extended train.
Of various dress and various form they show'd;
From eastern steeps, a grisly host descends,
O'er whose grim chief a tyger's hide depends:
The tusky jaws grin o'er his shaggy brow,
The eye-balls glare, the paws depend below;
From his bored ears contorted serpents hung,
And drops of gore seem'd rolling on his tongue.
From northern wilds, dark move the vulture-race;
Black tufts of quills their shaded foreheads grace;
The claws extend, the beak is oped for blood,
The condor, frowning, from a southern plain,
Borne on a standard, leads a numerous train:
Clench'd in his talons, hangs a warrior dead,
His long beak pointing where the squadrons tread;
His wings, far-stretching, cleave the whistling wind.
And his broad tail o'ershades the host behind.
From other plains, and other hills, afar,
The assembling tribes throng dreadful to the war;
Some wear the crested furies of the snake,
Some show the emblems of a stream or lake;
All, from the Power they serve, assume their mode,
And foam and yell to taste the Incan blood.
The prince, incautious, with his train drew near,
Known for an Inca by his dress and air.
Sudden the savage bands to vengeance move,
Demand their arms and chace them round the grove;
His scattering host in vain the combat tries,
While circling thousands from their ambush rise;
Nor power to strive, nor hope of flight remains,
They bow in silence to the victor's chains.
When, now the gathering squadrons throng the plain,
And echoing skies the rending shouts retain;
Zamor, the leader of the tyger-band,
By choice appointed to the first command,
Shrugg'd up his spotted spoils above the rest,
And, grimly frowning, thus the croud address'd:
Warriors, attend; tomorrow leads abroad
Our sacred vengeance for our brothers' blood.
On those scorch'd plains forever must they lie,
Their bones still naked to the burning sky?
Left in the field for foreign hawks to tear,
Nor our own vultures can the banquet share.
Shall sate your vengeance with a nobler feast;
When the proud Sun, that terror of the plain,
Shall grieve in heaven for all his children slain;
O'er boundless fields our slaughtering myriads roam,
And your dark Powers command a happier home.
Mean while, ye tribes, these men of solar race,
Food for the flames, your bloody rites shall grace:
Resigns in fire; this night demands their death:
All but the Inca; him, reserved in state,
These conquering hands ere long shall immolate,
To that dread Power that thunders in the skies,
A grateful gift, before his mother's eyes,
The savage ceased; the chiefs of every race
Lead the bold captives to their destined place;
The sun descends, the parting day expires,
And earth and heaven display their sparkling fires.
Soon the raised altars kindle round the gloom,
And call the victims to the vengeful doom;
Led to the scene, in sovereign pomp they tread,
And sing, by turns, the triumphs of the dead.
Amid the croud, beside his altar, stood
A beauteous form he rose, of princely grace,
The only hope of his illustrious race;
His aged sire, through numerous years, had shone,
The first supporter of the Incan throne;
Wise Capac loved the youth, and graced his hand
With a fair virgin, from a neighbouring band;
And him the joyous prince, in equal prime;
Had chose t'attend him round the savage clime.
He mounts the pyre; the flames approach his breath,
And thus he wakes the canticle of death.
O thou dark vault of heaven! his daily throne.
Where flee the absent glories of the Sun?
Ye starry hosts, that kindle from his eye,
Can you behold him in the western sky?
Or if, unseen, he rests his radiant head,
Beneath the confines of his watery bed;
When next his morning steps your courts inflame,
And seek on earth for young Azonto's name,
Then point these ashes, mark the smoky pile,
And say the hero suffer'd with a smile.
So shall the avenging Power, in fury drest,
Bind the red circler o'er his changing vest,
Bid dire destruction, on these dark abodes,
But oh! forbear to tell my stooping sire,
His darling hopes have fed a coward fire;
Why should he know the tortures of the brave?
Or fruitless sorrows bend him to the grave?
And may'st thou ne'er be told, my anxious fair,
What rending pangs these panting vitals tear;
But, blooming still, the impatient wish employ
On the blind hope of future scenes of joy.
Now haste, ye strides of death, the Power of day,
In absent slumbers, gives your vengeance way;
While fainter light these livid flames supply,
And short-lived thousands learn of me to die.
He ceased not speaking; when the yell of was
Drowns all their death-songs in a hideous jar;
Round the far echoing hills the yellings pour,
And wolves and tygers catch the distant roar.
Now more concordant all their voices join,
And round the plain they form the lengthening line;
When, to the music of the dismal din,
Indignant Zamor bids the dance begin.
Dim, thro' the shadowy fires, each changing form
Moves like a cloud before an evening storm;
When, o'er the moon's pale face and starry plain,
The shades of heaven lead on their broken train;
The mingling tribes their mazy circles tread,
Till the last groan proclaims the victims dead;
Then part the smoky flesh, enjoy the seast,
And lose their labours in oblivious rest.
Now, when the western hills proclaim'd the morn,
And falling fires were scarcely seen to burn,
Grimm'd by the horrors of the dreadful night,
The hosts woke fiercer for the distant fight;
And, dark and silent, like a shadowy grove,
The different tribes beneath their standards move.
But round the blissful city of the sun,
Since the young prince his foreign toils begun,
The prudent king collected, from afar,
His numerous hosts to meet the expected war.
The various tribes, in one extended train,
Move to the confines of an eastern plain;
Where, from the exalted kingdom's utmost end,
Sublimer hills and savage walks ascend.
High in the front, imperial Capac strode,
A golden girdle bound his snowy vest,
A mimic Sun hung trembling on his breast,
The lautu's circling band his temples twined,
The bow, the quiver shade his waist behind;
Raised high in air, his golden sceptre burn'd,
And hosts surrounding trembled as he turn'd.
O'er eastern hills he cast his kindling eye,
Where opening breaches lengthen down the sky;
In whose blue clefts, wide, sloping alleys bend,
Where annual floods from melting snows descend;
Now, dry and deep, far up the dreary height,
Show the dark squadrons moving into sight;
They throng and thicken on the smoky air,
And every breach pours down the dusky war.
So when an hundred streams explore their way,
Down the same slopes, convolving to the sea;
They boil, they bend, they urge their force amain,
Swell o'er th'obstructing craggs and sweep the distant plain.
Capac beholds, and waits the coming shock,
Unmoved, and gleaming like an icy rock;
And while for fight the arming hosts prepare,
Thus thro' the files he breathes the soul of war.
Ye hosts, of every tribe and every plain,
That live and flourish in my father's reign,
Long have your flocks and ripening harvests shown
The genial smiles of his indulgent throne;
As o'er surrounding realms his blessings flow'd,
And conquer'd all without the stain of blood.
But now, behold yon wide-collecting band,
With threatening war, demands the happy land:
Beneath the dark, immeasurable host,
Descending, swarming, how the craggs are lost!
Already now, their ravening eyes behold
Your star-bright temples and your gates of gold;
The warm libation of your children's gore.
Move then to vengeance, meet the whelming flood,
The strife is fierce, your fanes and fields the prize,
The warrior conquers or the infant dies.
Fill'd with his fire, the hosts, in squared array,
Eye the dark legions and demand the affray;
Their pointed arrows, rising on the bow,
Look up the sky and chide the lagging foe.
Fierce Zamor, frowning, leads the grisly train,
Moves from the clefts, and stretches o'er the plain;
He gives the shriek; the deep convulsing sound
The hosts re-echo; and the hills around
Retain the rending tumult; all the air
Clangs in the conflict of the clashing war.
But firm, undaunted, as a shelvy strand,
That meets the billowy surge, the squadrons stand;
Bend the broad bow, in lengthier circuit spread,
And showers of arrows thicken heaven with shade.
When each grim host, in closer conflict join'd,
Clench the dire ax, and cast the bow behind;
Thro' broken ranks sweep wide the rapid course,
Now struggle back, now sidelong sway the force;
Here, from grim chiefs is lopp'd the grisly head;
All gride the dying, all deface the dead;
There, scattering o'er the field, in thin array,
Man strives with man, and stones with axes play;
With broken shafts they follow and they fly,
And yells and groans and shouts invade the sky;
Round all the plains and groves, the ground is strow'd
With sever'd limbs and corses bathed in blood.
Long raged the strife; and where, on either side,
A friend, a father or a brother died,
No trace remain'd of what he show'd before.
Mangled with horrid wounds and smear'd with gore.
Now the Peruvians, in collected might,
With one wide sweep had wing'd the savage flight;
But heaven's bright Splendor in his midday race,
With glooms unusual, veil'd his radiant face.
By slow degrees a solemn twilight moves,
Browns the dim heavens and shades the conscious groves.
The observing Inca views, with wild surprise,
Deep glooms on earth, no cloud around the skies;
His host o'ershaded in the field of blood,
All mute with wonder, cease the strife to wage,
Gaze at each-other, and forget their rage;
When pious Capac, to the listening croud,
Raised high his wand and pour'd his voice aloud:
Ye chiefs and warriors of Peruvian race,
Some dire offence obscures my father's face;
Nor save his children, nor behold them slain?
Fly! speed your course, and seek the distant town,
Ere darkness shroud you in a deeper frown;
The lengthening walls your squadrons shall defend,
While my sad steps the sacred dome ascend;
There learn the cause, and ward the woes we fear–
Haste, haste, my sons, I guard the flying rear.
The hero spoke; the trembling tribes obey,
While deeper glooms obscure the source of day.
Sudden, the savage bands collect amain,
Hang on the rear and sweep them o'er the plain;
Their shouts, redoubling o'er the flying war,
Drown the loud groans and torture all the air;
The hawks of heaven, that o'er the field had stood
Scared by the tumult from the scent of blood,
Cleave the far gloom; the beasts forget their prey,
And scour the waste, and give the war its way.
Zamor, elate with horrid joy, beheld
The Sun depart, his children fly the field,
And raised his rending voice; Thou darkening sky,
Deepen thy glooms, the Power of death is nigh;
Behold him rising from his nightly throne,
To veil the heavens and drive the conquer'd Sun!
And all his armies imitate his flight.
O dark, infernal Power, confirm thy reign;
Give deadlier shades and heap the piles of slain:
Soon, the young captive prince shall roll in fire,
And all his race accumulate the pyre.
Ye mountain vultures, here your vengeance pour,
In these dread fields, beneath your frowning sky,
Rush forward, warriors, hide the plains with dead;
'Twas here our friends, in former combat, bled;
Strow'd thro' the waste, their bloody bones demand
This sweeping vengeance from our conquering hand.
He said; and, high before the tyger-train,
With longer strides, hangs forward o'er the slain,
Bends, like a falling tree, to reach the foe,
And o'er tall Capac aims a deadly blow.
The king beheld the ax, and with his wand,
Struck the raised weapon from his grasping hand
Then clench'd the falling helve, and whirling round,
Fell'd furious hosts of heroes to the ground:
Nor stay'd, but follow'd, where the squadrons run,
Fearing to fight, forsaken by the Sun:
Till Cusco's walls salute their longing sight,
And the wide gates receive their rapid flight.
The folds are barr'd, the foes, in shade conceal'd,
Like howling wolves, rave round the affrighted field.
The monarch now ascends the sacred dome,
Where the Sun's image wore a faded gloom.
Thro' all the courts a solemn shade prevail'd,
And dismal groans his listening ear assail'd;
Deep from an inner shrine, the stifled sighs
Breathe forth awhile, and these sad accents rise.
Was it for this, my son to distant lands
Must trace the wilds, amid those savage bands?
In mournful silence for my slaughter'd son?
Oh, had his beam, ere that disastrous day,
That snatch'd the youth from these fond arms away,
Received my mounting spirit to the sky,
That sad Oella might have seen him die.
When those fell tygers drank his sacred blood?
Did not the pious prince, with rites divine;
Feed the pure flame, within thy hallow'd shrine?
And early learn, beneath his father's hand,
To shed thy blessings round the favour'd land?
Form'd by thy laws the royal seat to grace,
Son of thy son, and glory of his race.
Where, dearest Rocha, rests thy beauteous head?
Where the rent robes thy hapless mother made?
I see thee, mid those hideous hills of snow,
Pursued and slaughter'd by the savage foe;
Whose horrid shrine demands thy harmless blood.
Snatch me, O Sun, to happier worlds of light–
No shroud me, shroud me, with thyself in night–
Thou hear'st me not; thou dread, departed Power,
Thy face is dark, and Rocha is no more.
Thus heard the silent king; his heaving heart
Caught all her grief, and bore a father's part.
The cause, suggested by her tender moan,
That veil'd the midday splendors of the sun,
And shouts insulting of the raging foe,
Fix'd him suspense, in all the strength of woe
A doubtful moment held his changing choice;
Now would he sooth her; half assumes his voice;
But greater cares the rising wish controul,
And call forth all his dignity of soul.
Why should he cease to ward the coming fate?
Or she be told the foes besiege the gate?
High in the front, with kindling lustre glow'd:
Swift thro' the portal, flew the hero's eye,
And hail'd the growing Splendor in the sky.
The thronging host, now brightening at the sight,
Pour round the dome, impatient for the fight;
The chief, descending, in the portal stood,
O sovereign Soul of heaven; thy changing face
Makes or destroys the glory of thy race.
If, from the bounds of earth, my son be fled,
First of thy line that ever graced the dead;
For that loved youth, who never must return;
Forgive thine armies; when, in fields of blood,
As now thy glory, with superior day,
Glows thro' the field and leads the warrior's way,
May our delighted souls, to vengeance driven,
Burn with new brightness in the cause of heaven;
For thy slain son see larger squadrons bleed,
We mourn the hero, but avenge the deed.
He said; and, from the battlements on high,
A watchful warrior raised an eager cry;
An Inca white on yonder altar tied–
Tis Rocha's self–the flame ascends his side.
In sweeping haste the bursting gates unbar,
And flood the champaign with a tide of war;
A cloud of arrows leads the rapid train,
They shout, they swarm, they hide the moving plain;
The bows and quivers strow the field behind,
And the raised axes cleave the parting wind;
The prince, confest to every warrior's sight,
Inspires each soul and centres all the fight;
Each hopes to snatch him from the kindling pyre,
Each fears his breath already flits in fire:
While Zamor spread his thronging squadrons wide,
Wedged like a wall–and thus the king defied:
Haste! son of Light, pour fast the winged war,
The prince, the dying prince demands your care:
Hear how his death-song chides your dull delay,
Lift larger strides, bend forward to the affray;
Ere folding flames prevent his stifled groan,
He said; and raised his shaggy form on high,
And bade the shafts glide thicker thro' the sky.
Like the black billows of the lifted main,
Rolls into sight the long Peruvian train;
A white sail, bounding, on the billows tost,
Is Capac, striding o'er the furious host.
Now meet the dreadful chiefs, with eyes on fire;
Beneath their blows the parting ranks retire:
In whirlwind-sweep, their meeting axes bound,
Wheel, crash in air, and plough the trembling ground;
Their sinewy limbs, in fierce contortions, bend,
And mutual strokes, with equal force, descend;
The king sways backward from the struggling foe,
Collects new strength, and with a circling blow
Rush'd furious on; his flinty edge, on high,
Met Zamor's helve, and glancing, cleft his thigh,
The savage fell; when, thro' the tyger-train,
The driving Inca swept a widening lane;
Whole ranks fall staggering, where he lifts his arm,
Or roll before him, like a billowy storm;
Behind his steps collecting legions close,
While, centred in a circling ridge of foes,
He drives his furious way; the prince unties,
And thus his voice–Dread Sovereign of the skies,
Accept my living son, again bestow'd,
Move, warriors, move, complete the work begun,
Crush the grim race, avenge the injured Sun.
The savage host, that view'd the daring deed,
And saw deep squadrons with their leader bleed,
Raised high the shriek of horror; all the plain
Is trod with flight and cover'd with the slain.
The bold Peruvians circle round the field,
Confine their flight and bid the relics yield:
While Capac raised his placid voice again–
Ye conquering hosts, collect the scatter'd train;
The Sun commands to stay the rage of war,
He knows to conquer, but he loves to spare.
He ceased; and, where the savage leader lay
Weltering in gore, directs his eager way;
Unwraps the tyger's hide, and strives in vain
To close the wound, and mitigate the pain;
And, while soft pity moved his manly breast,
Raised the huge head and thus the chief addrest.
Too long, dread prince, thy raging arms withstood
His sovereign will commands all strife to cease,
His realm is concord, and his pleasure, peace;
This copious carnage, spreading all the plain,
Insults his bounties, but confirms his reign.
Enough, 'tis past–thy parting breath demands
The last, sad office from my yielding hands.
To share thy pains, and feel thy hopeless woe,
Are rites ungrateful to a falling foe;
Yet rest in peace; and know, a chief so brave,
When life departs, shall find an honour'd grave;
These hands, in mournful pomp, thy tomb shall rear,
And tribes unborn thy hapless fate declare.
Insult me not with tombs, the savage cried,
Let closing clods thy coward carcase hide;
But these brave bones, unbury'd on the plain,
Touch not with dust, nor dare with rites profane;
Let no curst earth conceal this gorey head,
Nor songs proclaim the dreadful Zamor dead.
Have follow'd, feasting on thy slaughter'd train,
Me wouldst thou cover? no! from yonder sky,
The wide-beak'd hawk, that now beholds me die,
Soon, with his cowering train, my flesh shall tear,
And wolves and tygers vindicate their share.
Receive, dread Powers, (since I can slay no more)
My last glad victim, this devoted gore.
Thus pour'd the vengeful chief his fainting breath,
And lost his utterance in the gasp of death.
The sad remaining tribes confess the Power,
That sheds his bounties round the favourite shore;
All bow obedient to the Incan throne,
And blest Oella hails her living son. 


Slowly up silent peaks, the white edge of the world,
 Trod four archangels, clear against the unheeding sky,
Bearing, with quiet even steps, and great wings furled,
 A little dingy coffin; where a child must lie,
 Have bidden a child turn from the spring and the sunlight,
And shut him in that lonely shell, to drop for ever
 Into the emptiness and silence, into the night. . . .)

They then from the sheer summit cast, and watched it fall,
 Through unknown glooms, that frail black coffin -- and therein
And curled up like some crumpled, lonely flower-petal --
Till it was no more visible; then turned again
With sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain. 


There in the middle of the field, by the side of a crystalline stream, I saw a bird-cage whose rods and hinges were fashioned by an expert's hands. In one corner lay a dead bird, and in another were two basins -- one empty of water and the other of seeds. I stood there reverently, as if the lifeless bird and the murmur of the water were worthy of deep silence and respect -- something worth of examination and meditation by the heard and conscience. 

As I engrossed myself in view and thought, I found that the poor creature had died of thirst beside a stream of water, and of hunger in the midst of a rich field, cradle of life; like a rich man locked inside his iron safe, perishing from hunger amid heaps of gold. 

Before my eyes I saw the cage turned suddenly into a human skeleton, and the dead bird into a man's heart which was bleeding from a deep wound that looked like the lips of a sorrowing woman. A voice came from that wound saying, "I am the human heart, prisoner of substance and victim of earthly laws. 



"Everything of beauty that awakens my love and desire is a disgrace, according to man's conceptions; everything of goodness that I crave is but naught, according to his judgment. 

"I am the lost human heart, imprisoned in the foul dungeon of man's dictates, tied with chains of earthly authority, dead and forgotten by laughing humanity whose tongue is tied and whose eyes are empty of visible tears
 


All these words I heard, and I saw them emerging with a stream of ever thinning blood from that wounded heart. 

More was said, but my misted eyes and crying should prevented further sight or hearing. 


Visionless is no way to be: 
having sight, yet unable to see.
Soul's blindness that's dark and deep
indicates your spirit is fast asleep.

Use the Word to ignite your inner spark
To have Life's purpose and meaning for self
promotes character and personal delight.

Having vision is intended for all, 
so get fitted with some new glasses.
Accomplishments are attainable, provided you're

Because this graveyard is a hill, 
I must climb up to see my dead, 
stopping once midway to rest 
beside this tree. 


It was here, between the anticipation 
of exhaustion, and exhaustion, 
between vale and peak, 
my father came down to me 

and we climbed arm in arm to the top. 
He cradled the bouquet I'd brought, 
and  a good son, never mentioned his grave, 
erect like a door behind him. 

And it was here, one summer day, I sat down 
to read an old book.  When I looked up 
from the noon-lit page, I saw a vision 
of a world about to come, and a world about to go. 


Truth is, I've not seen my father 
since he died, and, no, the dead 
do not walk arm in arm with me. 

If I carry flowers to them, I do so without their help, 
the blossoms not always bright, torch-like, 
but often heavy as sodden newspaper. 


Truth is, I came here with my son one day, 
and we rested against this tree, 
and I fell asleep, and dreamed 

a dream which, upon my boy waking me, I told. 
Neither of us understood. 
Then we went up. 


Even this is not accurate. 
Let me begin again: 

Between two griefs, a tree. 
Between my hands, white chrysanthemums, yellow 
    chrysanthemums. 


The old book I finished reading 
I've since read again and again. 

And what was far grows near, 
and what is near grows more dear, 

and all of my visions and interpretations 
depend on what I see, 

and between my eyes is always 
the rain, the migrant rain. 


'My eyes are better, and I shall travel slowly toward home.'



From the regions of the Night,
Coming with recovered sight
From the spell of darkness free,
What will Danenhower see?

He will see when he arrives,
Doctors taking human lives.
He will see a learned judge
Whose decision will not budge
Till both litigants are fleeced
And his palm is duly greased.
Lawyers he will see who fight
Day by day and night by night;
Never both upon a side,
Though their fees they still divide.
Preachers he will see who teach
That it is divine to preach
That they fan a sacred fire
And are worthy of their hire.
He will see a trusted wife

(Pride of some good husband's life)
Enter at a certain door
And-but he will see no more.
He will see Good Templars reel
See a prosecutor steal,
And a father beat his child.
He'll perhaps see Oscar Wilde.

From the regions of the Night
Coming with recovered sight
From the bliss of blindness free,
That's what Danenhower'll see.



 

One, two
We went to the zoo
Three, four
A fierce wild boar
Five, six
Fluffy white chicks
Seven, eight
Charming deer's gait
Nine, ten
A big lion's den




In flat America, in Chicago, 
Graceland cemetery on the German North Side. 
Forty feet of Corinthian candle 
celebrate Pullman embedded 
lonely raisin in a cake of concrete. 
The Potter Palmers float 
in an island parthenon. 
Barons of hogfat, railroads and wheat 
are postmarked with angels and lambs. 

But the Getty tomb: white, snow patterned 
in a triangle of trees swims dappled with leaf shadow, 
sketched light arch within arch 
delicate as fingernail moons. 

The green doors should not be locked. 
Doors of fern and flower should not be shut. 
Louis Sullivan, I sit on your grave. 
It is not now good weather for prophets.
Sun eddies on the steelsmoke air like sinking honey. 

On the inner green door of the Getty tomb 
(a thighbone's throw from your stone) 
a marvel of growing, blooming, thrusting into seed: 
how all living wreathe and insinuate 
in the circlet of repetition that never repeats: 
ever new birth never rebirth. 
Each tide pool microcosm spiraling from your hand. 

Sullivan, you had another five years 
when your society would give you work. 
Thirty years with want crackling in your hands. 
Thirty after years with cities 
flowering and turning grey in your beard. 

All poets are unemployed nowadays. 
My country marches in its sleep. 
The past structures a heavy mausoleum 
hiding its iron frame in masonry. 
Men burn like grass 
while armies grow. 


Thirty years in the vast rumbling gut 
of this society you stormed 
to be used, screamed 
no louder than any other breaking voice. 
The waste of a good man 
bleeds the future that's come 
in Chicago, in flat America, 
where the poor still bleed from the teeth, 
housed in sewers and filing cabinets, 
where prophets may spit into the wind 
till anger sleets their eyes shut, 
where this house that dances the seasons 
and the braid of all living 
and the joy of a man making his new good thing 
is strange, irrelevant as a meteor, 
in Chicago, in flat America 
in this year of our burning. 


This year, I have a very good harvest of pears

Most of them were given to friends as gifts, 

And the rest was used to make fresh fruit juice.

The pears have been ripening last several weeks.

Friends have been visiting to eat or to take them home.

Every year, our friends remember our pear season to come.

Every year, we have new friends who love these pears after their first bites.

This week, we visit our grand children who live far away.

They enjoy the fruits, happily saying 'this is the gift from grandpa'.

Grandpa's pears are crisp and tasty

The supermarket pears are 'not of their equals'.

We grandparents visit the grandchildren on a long weekend.

We swimm together before the pool will be closed next week.

There is an oak forest adjacent to the back of the house.

When the winds blow, a lot of leaves fall.

Falling leaves glide in the air before sofltly touching pool water.

They are like small boats aimlessly floating around in the pool.




A song session under a banyan tree begins the day
Girls in moth-wing saris, young men in white tunics
Disperse to cottage-style classrooms in a forest
Students follow after their teachers, learning by ear
Soaking up the song cycles of Ghandarvaveda music
Devotional strains ring out in this secular school 
Art is the vehicle, so a wanderer like me feels at home
Now I peek into the dance theater, roofed in thatch
Bharatanayam dancers are going through basic steps
Bodies and heads tilt as if guided by inner gyroscopes 
As if all movements are encompassed in imaginary circles
As if wearing elaborate headdresses that must not fall
Carrying invisible pagodas of heads atop their heads
Their steps seem placed in footprints of a larger being
Self-presenting in freeze-frames, in precise iterations
Like a bead-necklace of moments strung together in a story
Like folkloric variants, or a myth coming down through time
Every gesture an act of self-offering, yet always aloof: 
Pouring forth, maintaining, taking back, concealing-  
From Theosophy's inner circle, founding this art school
From ashes of patronage networks and prurient connoisseurship
She brought devadasi dance into the modern world


Her little face is like a walnut shell
With wrinkling lines; her soft, white hair adorns
Her withered brows in quaint, straight curls, like horns;
And all about her clings an old, sweet smell.
Prim is her gown and quakerlike her shawl.
Well might her bonnets have been born on her.
The subject of a strong religious call?
In snow or shine, from bed to bed she runs,
All twinkling smiles and texts and pious tales,
Her mittened hands, that ever give or pray,
Bearing a sheaf of tracts, a bag of buns:
A wee old maid that sweeps the Bridegroom's way,
Strong in a cheerful trust that never fails. 


I sit, 
A little man
And wonder, 
Open eyed: 
This sweeping sky; 
A countless myriad of stars, 
Galaxy clusters, 
Clouds of gas.
All multicoloured: 
As befits a multiverse.
Spreading on and on
And on
An infinitesimally splendid 
Eternity
Of space
And time.

Thousands of years required
To reach the nearest star, 
By human flight.
Trillions of planets
Likely holding life.
A universe growing, 
Exploding, 
At twelve million miles per minute.
From singularity
To colossus
So vast
So awesome
So splendidly beautiful
That all I can say, 
Is



Time to walk in my wake, insight for the journey
Fate to spark, reveal what lies beneath the bark
Distracted by the roots of a tree


Show me your meaning
Am I dreaming? 
A hillside descending down
I continue on foot, I take a look

From the branch of the tree, second sight
A leaf takes flight, caught in the wind


It moves to the right, spinning in circular motion
Free as waves in the ocean, rhythmic and illicit as an accordion
Terminal velocity brings the leaf lower, inhuman it raises in updraft
Predestined, unknown is its path

The sun lows, where now for it to go
Constant revolution, a dance in the sky
Like a bee, I wonder how it flies
Its journey free willed or has it let loose its free will? 

Does it lead or is it led? 
Winding low, it spirals lower
Lost for power, the end of its hour
Returned to the earth, laid to rest

I confess, this has a meaning to be seen
I pause, my journey is done, lowered is the sun
Am I dreaming? 
Random steps walk over the brittle leaf, no utterance of speech

Visual intake for my walk in wake
Time for the direction of fate
A gust of wind let it begin
Reanimation sends it to the left
I pause again and inhale a deep breath


There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night—
Ten to make and the match to win—
A bumping pitch and a blinding light,
An hour to play and the last man in.
And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat,
Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,
But his captain's hand on his shoulder smote
'Play up! play up! and play the game! '

The sand of the desert is sodden red,—
Red with the wreck of a square that broke; —
The Gatling's jammed and the Colonel dead,
And the regiment blind with dust and smoke.
The river of death has brimmed his banks,
And England's far, and Honour a name,
But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:
'Play up! play up! and play the game! '

This is the word that year by year,
While in her place the school is set,
Every one of her sons must hear,
And none that hears it dare forget.
This they all with a joyful mind
Bear through life like a torch in flame,
And falling fling to the host behind—
'Play up! play up! and play the game


They are not long, the weeping and the laughter, 
Love and desire and hate: 
I think they have no portion in us after 
We pass the gate. 

They are not long, the days of wine and roses: 
Out of a misty dream 
Our path emerges for a while, then closes 
Within a dream. 

I feel the air with a kind of tension
I stare at you standing close to the window
Smoking your cigarette in a peaceful way
Distant look in your eyes 
Like you were in another dimension

Your hair, as gold as the sun, 
A little bit messed
Falling over your eyes
Oh.  


those blue eyes
Two crystalline drops of ocean
Enough to drown me deep inside of you
Then, I stare at your nose
Pretentious and imposing
I pretend to avoid your lips
But they seem to move and breath my name
Full, lusty and opulent lips

You look down the street 
Giggle a little bit
No, I could never forget about your smile
All I know is canvas could never capture its light
I like the way your teeth are aligned
Guarding the fountain of the greatest pleasures
Your sweet, soft and warm tongue
The one that gives me butterflies 
Every time it touches mine
All the time it runs over my body

You turn back to bedroom
Pick up the ashtray
Your body against the light
What can I say about your skin. 
White, pale, just like marble
I stare at your chest and shoulders
They have perfect dimensions
Not too large, not too sturdy
Hairless chest sprinkled with freckles
Wide shoulders leading to your arms
Arms that make me feel safe
Arms that hold me in sign of possession
Yes, I'm yours, I whisper with passion
And when you hold me I can feel your hands
Firm, but delicate hands
Gifted with such a velvet touch
You run your fingertips down my spine so gently 
That makes me shiver 
Takes my breath away
Oh.  you and your long fingers. 

You get close to me in bed
What makes me look straight to your stomach
It's plain, with no muscles
Teasing me with those entrances along your hip-bones
I see you're wearing a black towel
I won't talk about what's forbidden
Because what's forbidden is way more tempting

You return to the window to look down the street
You say something but I can't seem to hear
You're standing there, side face
The curve of your round bottom
Leading my eyes to your legs
Your strong and stout thighs
Reminding me the way I feel
When they rub against mine

You call my name to get my attention
For a second I feel scared 
And in response to that I close my eyes
Don't want to wake up if this is a dream
So I feel those lips kissing my shoulder
Right on the curve that leads to my neck
'You're beautiful.' you whisper
And with your hand behind my head
And your body on top of mine
You lay me down in bed to fulfill me one more time. 

Now being on the eve of death, discharged
From every mortal hope and earthly care,
I questioned how my soul might best employ
This hand, and this still wakeful flame of mind,
In the brief hours yet left me for their use;
Wherefore have I bethought me of my friend,
Of you, Philarchus, and your company,
Yet wavering in the faith and unconfirmed;
Perchance that I may break into thine heart
Some sorrowful channel for the love divine,
I make this simple record of our proof
Whereof the end already for the most
Is death this day with steadfast faith endured.

We were in prison many days, close-pent
In the black lower dungeon, housed with thieves
And murderers and divers evil men;
So foul a pressure, we had almost died,
Even there, in struggle for the breath of life
Amid the stench and unendurable heat;
Nor could we find each other save by voice
Or touch, to know that we were yet alive,
So terrible was the darkness. Yea, 'twas hard
To keep the sacred courage in our hearts,
When all was blind with that unchanging night,
And foul with death, and on our ears the taunts
And ribald curses of the soldiery
Fell mingled with the prisoners' cries, a load
Sharper to bear, more bitter than their blows.
At first, what with that dread of our abode,
Our sudden apprehension, and the threats
Ringing perpetually in our ears, we lost
The living fire of faith, and like poor hinds
Even Perpetua, whose joyous faith
Was in the later holier days to be
The stay and comfort of our weaker ones,
Was silent for long whiles. Perchance she shrank
In the mere sickness of the flesh, confused
And shaken by our new and horrible plight--
The tender flesh, untempered and untried,
Not quickened yet nor mastered by the soul;
For she was of a fair and delicate make,
Most gently nurtured, to whom stripes and threats
And our foul prison-house were things undreamed.
But little by little as our spirits grew
Inured to suffering, with clasped hands, and tongues
That cheered each other to incessant prayer,
We rose and faced our trouble: we recalled
Our Master's sacred agony and death,
Setting before our eyes the high reward
Of steadfast faith, the martyr's deathless crown.

So passed some days whose length and count we lost,
Our bitterest trial. Then a respite came.
One who had interest with the governor
Wrought our removal daily for some hours
Into an upper chamber, where we sat
And held each other's hands in childish joy,
Receiving the sweet gift of light and air
With wonder and exceeding thankfulness.
And then began that life of daily growth
In mutual exaltation and sweet help
That bore us as a gently widening stream
Unto the ocean of our martyrdom.
Uniting all our feebler souls in one--

Perpetua had been troubled for her babe,
Robbed of the breast and now these many days
Wasting for want of food; but when that change
Whereof I spake, of light and liberty
Relieved the horror of our prison gloom,
They brought it to her, and she sat apart,
And nursed and tended it, and soon the child
Would not be parted from her arms, but throve
And fattened, and she kept it night and day.
And always at her side with sleepless care
Hovered the young Felicitas--a slight
And spiritual figure--every touch and tone
Charged with premonitory tenderness,
Herself so near to her own motherhood.
Thus lightened and relieved, Perpetua
Recovered from her silent fit. Her eyes
Regained their former deep serenity,
Her tongue its gentle daring; for she knew
Her life should not be taken till her babe
Had strengthened and outgrown the need of her.
Daily we were amazed at her soft strength,
Her pliant and untroubled constancy,
Her smiling, soldierly contempt of death,
Her beauty and the sweetness of her voice.

Her father, when our first few bitterest days
Were over, like a gust of grief and rage,
Came to her in the prison with wild eyes,
And cried: 'How mean you, daughter, when you say
Of honoured blood, the child of such as me,
Only of outcasts and rebellious slaves!'
And she, grief-touched, but with unyielding gaze,
Showing the fulness of her slender height:
'This vessel, father, being what it is,
An earthen pitcher, would you call it thus?
Or would you name it by some other name?'
'Nay, surely,' said the old man, catching breath,
And pausing, and she answered: 'Nor can I
Call myself aught but what I surely am--
In silent anger, left her for that time.

A special favour to Perpetua
Seemed daily to be given, and her soul
Wherefrom we all, less gifted, sore athirst,
Drank courage and fresh joy; for glowing dreams
Were sent her, full of forms august, and fraught
With signs and symbols of the glorious end
Once--at what hour I know not, for we lay
In that foul dungeon, where all hours were lost,
And day and night were indistinguishable--
We had been sitting a long silent while,
Some lightly sleeping, others bowed in prayer,
Perpetua spake to us and all were roused.
Her voice was rapt and solemn: 'Friends,' she said,
'Some word hath come to me in a dream. I saw
A ladder leading to heaven, all of gold,
Hung up with lances, swords, and hooks. A land
Of darkness and exceeding peril lay
Around it, and a dragon fierce as hell
Guarded its foot. We doubted who should first
Essay it, but you, Saturus, at last--
Advancing and against the cruel beast
Mounted, and took me by the hand, and I
The next one following, and so the rest
In order, and we entered with great joy
Into a spacious garden filled with light
And balmy presences of love and rest;
And there an old man sat, smooth-browed, white-haired,
Surrounded by unnumbered myriads
Of spiritual shapes and faces angel-eyed,
Milking his sheep; and lifting up his eyes
He welcomed us in strange and beautiful speech,
Unknown yet comprehended, for it flowed
Not through the ears, but forth-right to the soul,
Of each he placed a morsel of sweet curd;
And while the curd was yet within my mouth,
I woke, and still the taste of it remains,
Through all my body flowing like white flame,
Sweet as of some immaculate spiritual thing.'
And when Perpetua had spoken, all
Were silent in the darkness, pondering,
But Saturus spake gently for the rest:
'How perfect and acceptable must be
He bends to you, and through you speaks his will.
We know now that our martyrdom is fixed,
Nor need we vex us further for this life.'

While yet these thoughts were bright upon our souls,
There came the rumour that a day was set
To hear us. Many of our former friends,
Some with entreaties, some with taunts and threats,
Came to us to pervert us; with the rest
Again Perpetua's father, worn with care;
Nor could we choose but pity his distress,
So miserably, with abject cries and tears,
He fondled her and called her 'Domina,'
And bowed his aged body at her feet,
Beseeching her by all the names she loved
To think of him, his fostering care, his years,
And also of her babe, whose life, he said,
Would fail without her; but Perpetua,
Sustaining by a gift of strength divine
The fulness of her noble fortitude,
Answered him tenderly: 'Both you and I,
And all of us, my father, at this hour
Must be'; but when the poor old man was gone
She wept, and knelt for many hours in prayer,
Sore tried and troubled by her tender heart.

One day, while we were at our midday meal,
Our cell was entered by the soldiery,
And we were seized and borne away for trial.
A surging crowd had gathered, and we passed
From street to street, hemmed in by tossing heads
And faces cold or cruel; yet we caught
At moments from masked lips and furtive eyes
Of friends--some known to as and some unknown--
Many veiled messages of love and praise.
The floorways of the long basilica
Fronted us with an angry multitude;
And scornful eyes and threatening foreheads frowned
In hundreds from the columned galleries.
We were placed all together at the bar,
And though at first unsteadied and confused
By the imperial presence of the law,
The pomp of judgment and the staring crowd,
None failed or faltered; with unshaken tongue
Each met the stern Proconsul's brief demand
In clear profession. Rapt as in a dream,
Scarce conscious of my turn, nor how I spake,
I watched with wondering eyes the delicate face
And figure of Perpetua; for her
We that were youngest of our company
Loved with a sacred and absorbing love,
A passion that our martyr's brotherly vow
Had purified and made divine. She stood
In dreamy contemplation, slightly bowed,
A glowing stillness that was near a smile
Upon her soft closed lips. Her turn had come,
When, like a puppet struggling up the steps,
Her father from the pierced and swaying crowd
Appeared, unveiling in his aged arms
The smiling visage of her babe. He grasped
Her robe, and strove to draw her down. All eyes
Were bent upon her. With a softening glance,
And voice less cold and heavy with death's doom,
The old Proconsul turned to her and said:
'Lady, have pity on your father's age;
Be mindful of your tender babe; this grain
Of harmless incense offer for the peace
And welfare of the Emperor'; but she,
Lifting far forth her large and noteless eyes,
As one that saw a vision, only said:
'I cannot sacrifice'; and he, harsh tongued,
Bending a brow upon her rough as rock,
With eyes that struck like steel, seeking to break
Or snare her with a sudden stroke of fear:
He motioned a contemptuous hand and bade
The lictors scourge the old man down and forth
With rods, and as the cruel deed was done,
Perpetua stood white with quivering lips,
And her eyes filled with tears. While yet his cries
Were mingling with the curses of the crowd,
Hilarianus, calling name by name,
Gave sentence, and in cold and formal phrase
Condemned us to the beasts, and we returned
Rejoicing to our prison. Then we wished
Our martyrdom could soon have followed, not
As doubting for our constancy, but some
Grew sick under the anxious long suspense.
Perpetua again was weighed upon
By grief and trouble for her babe, whom now
Her father, seeking to depress her will,
Withheld and would not send it; but at length
Word being brought her that the child indeed
No longer suffered, nor desired the breast,
All were united in new bonds of hope.
Now being fixed in certitude of death,
We stripped our souls of all their earthly gear,
The useless raiment of this world; and thus,
Striving together with a single will,
In daily increment of faith and power,
We were much comforted by heavenly dreams,
Visions of light and glory infinite
Were frequent with us, and by night or day
Taken at any moment on our lips;
So that we had no longer thought or care
Of life or of the living, but became
As spirits from this earth already freed,
Scarce conscious of the dwindling weight of flesh.
To Saturus appeared in dreams the space
The glowing gardens of eternal joy,
The halls and chambers of the cherubim,
In wreaths of endless myriads involved
The blinding glory of the angel choir,
Rolling through deeps of wheeling cloud and light
The thunder of their vast antiphonies.
The visions of Perpetua not less
Possessed us with their homely tenderness--
As one, wherein she saw a rock-set pool
And weeping o'er its rim a little child,
Her brother, long since dead, Dinocrates:
Though sore athirst, he could not reach the stream,
Being so small, and her heart grieved thereat.
She looked again, and lo! the pool had risen,
And the child filled his goblet, and drank deep,
And prattling in a tender childish joy
Ran gaily off, as infants do, to play.
By this she knew his soul had found release
From torment, and had entered into bliss.

Our vigil passed unbroken. Yesternight
They moved us to the amphitheatre,
Our final lodging-place on earth, and there
We sat together at our agape
For the last time. In silence, rapt and pale,
We hearkened to the aged Saturus,
Whose speech, touched with a ghostly eloquence,
Canvassed the fraud and littleness of life,
Perpetua was silent, but her eyes
Fell gently upon each of us, suffused
With inward and eradiant light; a smile
Played often upon her lips.

While yet we sat,
A tribune with a band of soldiery
Entered our cell, and would have had us bound
In harsher durance, fearing our escape
By fraud or witchcraft; but Perpetua,
Facing him gently with a noble note
Of wonder in her voice, and on her lips
A lingering smile of mournful irony:
'Sir, are ye not unwise to harass us,
And rob us of our natural food and rest?
Should ye not rather tend us with soft care,
And so provide a comely spectacle?
We shall not honour Caesar's birthday well,
If we be waste and weak, a piteous crew,
Poor playthings for your proud and pampered beasts.'
The noisy tribune, whether touched indeed,
Or by her grave and tender grace abashed,
Muttered and stormed a while, and then withdrew.
The short night passed in wakeful prayer for some,
For others in brief sleep, broken by dreams
And spiritual visitations. Earliest dawn
Found us arisen, and Perpetua,
Moving about with smiling lips, soft-tongued,
Besought us to take food; lest so, she said,
For all the strength and courage of our hearts,
Our bodies should fall faint. We heard without,
Already ere the morning light was full,
The din of preparation, and the hum
Of voices gathering in the upper tiers;
Yet had we seen so often in our thoughts
The picture of this strange and cruel death,
Its festal horror, and its bloody pomp,
The nearness scarcely moved us, and our hands
Met in a steadfast and unshaken clasp.

The day is over. Ah, my friend, how long
With its wild sounds and bloody sights it seemed!
Night comes, and I am still alive--even I,
The least and last--with other two, reserved
To grace to-morrow's second day. The rest
Have suffered and with holy rapture passed
Into their glory. Saturus and the men
Were given to bears and leopards, but the crowd
Feasted their eyes upon no cowering shape,
Nor hue of fear, nor painful cry. They died
Like armed men, face foremost to the beasts,
With prayers and sacred songs upon their lips.
Perpetua and the frail Felicitas
Were seized before our eyes and roughly stripped,
And shrinking and entreating, not for fear,
Nor hurt, but bitter shame, were borne away
Into the vast arena, and hung up
In nets, naked before the multitude,
For a fierce bull, maddened by goads, to toss.
Some sudden tumult of compassion seized
The crowd, and a great murmur like a wave
Rose at the sight, and grew, and thundered up
From tier to tier, deep and imperious:
So white, so innocent they were, so pure:
Their tender limbs so eloquent of shame;
And so our loved ones were brought back, all faint,
And covered with light raiment, and again
Led forth, and now with smiling lips they passed
Pale, but unbowed, into the awful ring,
Holding each other proudly by the hand.

Perpetua first was tossed, and her robe rent,
But, conscious only of the glaring eyes,
She strove to hide herself as best she could
In the torn remnants of her flimsy robe,
And putting up her hands clasped back her hair,
So that she might not die as one in grief,
Unseemly and dishevelled. Then she turned,
And in her loving arms caressed and raised
The dying, bruised Felicitas. Once more
Gored by the cruel beast, they both were borne
Swooning and mortally stricken from the field.
Perpetua, pale and beautiful, her lips
Parted as in a lingering ecstasy,
Could not believe the end had come, but asked
When they were to be given to the beasts.
The keepers gathered round her--even they--
In wondering pity--while with fearless hand,
Bidding us all be faithful and stand firm,
She bared her breast, and guided to its goal
The gladiator's sword that pierced her heart.

The night is passing. In a few short hours
A boundless exaltation lifts my soul!
I know that they who left us, Saturus,
Perpetua, and the other blessed ones,
Await me at the opening gates of heaven. 


Long live The UN! 
Providence of The Oppressed; 
And nightmare of The Oppressor.

I still wind
on a reel of gold

all sugar plumed, pasteled expectations; 
a panoramic view at Easter

of violet-trimmed hats
against a primrose sky;

treble clef of stars: 
music unfolding like this fugue of far dimensions

my mother singing in a green plaid dress.

mysteriously without the wind
the green tree tops begin to bend
taken up at the hem
the cherry-glazed day arrives: 

the vivid rose ensoleil in the outer snows



Skinny dipping, down by the sea


Went there that day us and she, 
I today again, when I was free.

Oh! Happen-chance she too there
Waved to me, from a lounging chair

Skimpily clad and a bit bare
Obligingly I crept to the vixen lair

Smelt the air and pounding surf
Stood I there on receding turf

Baffled watched the rolling waves, 
as she spun the glamorous tales.

Gathered my wits to feel whole.
Imagined myself in a bygone role

Guards, rafts and sailing boats
Bobbing up an down my ego floats

Gazing up at the wooly clouds

Perfect setting to spend your lives
and also to keep away your wives


O fair lady
where are you going
don't you know
it is going to be twelve
though you are wondering
are you not afraid of the rapists
who just play with your skin
and give you just a life long pain


I fell asleep to the voice of an angel last night
She brought comfort to my soul and made life a delight
Her syllables had been formed in heaven's blessed light

Though we have known each other for a time that's so slight
It seems as if our friendship had been formed with foresight
I wish to have the pleasure to see her dressed in white

Dorothy is her name, anyone beholding her sight
Shall be caught up by her beauty and caring forthright
Her brightness obscuring all the stars, moon and sunlight



Prisoners of conscience

Realm of power
An understood condition
An understood provision
A misunderstood criticism
A misunderstood question
A guilty conscience




It was a dark night, full of fights, as if the sun will never rise
The bullets were passing beside me, but I couldn't realize
All the people were afraid, , I was trying to resist anywise
The voice of freedom rose high in the souls of the arise 
The life of the oppressors, was walking anticlockwise 
The voice of injustice blinked away, like its form analyse

The devil thought and thought, 'How could I make a plan, 
to stop that voice, to regain everything without complain'
The birds began to sing, voice of freedom returned again
to prevail the happiness again, , to resist suffering pain.
The sun which we thought that it will never rise again. 
it rose to remove steps of a man made it without vain.


The sun will keep rising and rising every day,
to bloom the flowers, 


voice prints of the angels on the crystal air 
remind me of your
the midnight clear you taught me to sing

the three pronged golden tuning fork of
Modern Library's Giant Walter Scott

delicate painted rosebud china perfect
for the dolls and packed in straw.
voice prints of the angels, all the snow

expectancies I had guarded in my heart's
white candle-flame

my small apartment
and there you are again
not a bit ghostly, glad and
making ornaments from styrofoam

balls and sequins, glitter in every color
of the spectrum (just fill one Swanson chicken pie
pan with glue and dip, the other pan filled with spangles. , swirl) 
and I am richer than diamonds, emeralds

pearls, rubies or the sudden topaz of
the Star
that we believed in- I believe in still, 

oh Grandmother in rose taffeta, 
made of music and tears

the solipsistic wanting of bee-community
Blooming, be it plant’s concern


EACH small gleam was a voice 
-A lantern voice- 
In little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold. 
A chorus of colors came over the water; 
The wondrous leaf-shadow no longer wavered, 
No pines crooned on the hills 
The blue night was elsewhere a silence 
When the chorus of colors came over the water, 
Little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold. 

Small glowing pebbles 
Thrown on the dark plane of evening 
And eternity, with soul's rest. 
Little priests, little holy fathers 
None can doubt the truth of your hymning 
When the marvelous chorus comes over the water 
Songs of carmine, violet, green, gold. 


The voices in my head is telling me not to let you go, 
You had lay me down to sleep, 
You walk pass by me in dreams, 
You had made me happy, 
You took care of me, 
The voices are telling me to let you stay, 
The voices in my heart is telling me to open up, 
My soul tells me not to open up, 
The voices are everywhere in my body, 
My head, my soul, and my heart, 
My body is numb, 
You have took what was once given, 
You have made your mistakes by letting me go, 
I was once happy with you, 
The voices are telling me to hold on to you, 
But I have took what was once you had given to me and that was trust, 
You have betrayed my trust, 
Betrayed your friends, 
The voices are telling me to help you, 
But I choose not to. 

The cows go moo
the ghost says boo
beez goes buzz
pepsi goes fizz
the bombs goes boom
the elecricity goes zip zap zoom
people goes achoo
ans when i am done i say wohoo! 


You cannot see, feel or touch me, 
 You can only read my mind-
 thru' my stories, if those stories 
 are absolute and true; 
 for we are optically opaque, 
 where impressions must be built 
 on tales of steel darkness, 
 deaths presence and absent touch, 
 lifting life, love and existence 
 but still voices in your head
 tell you what you want to hear-
 about who you think I am.
 Am I a friend or am I Death? 
 And, if somehow I wasn't who
 the person you think I be, 
 would you label me inexistent, 
 and my words shibboleth, 
 like an Anaphora poem, 
 or the graphics of Dali? 
 Then again, does it really matter? 

 After midnight, I muse, 
 reclusively, impersonally, 
 sometimes I'll take my pen, 
 and place it by my sword
 to see if the adage holds 
 that a Cross is mightier 
 than an Elk-Ridge, 
 while I write my stories, strange, 
 beyond life's normality's, 
 [I relate to this very well]
 and quite content so I be
 with life and love as it comes, 
 but do your voices tell you that, 
 and if so, would you claim you were dreaming? 

 Now all of this of me you know, 
 but does that mean you really know me at all? 
 What if this were just another-
 one of my many strange tales, 
 as people like me often do
 as Imagists of the Silent Word. 
 So tell me you believe
 your foresight is be-trumps your hindsight, 
 and I'll sell you an Island 
 of step peering scrapers, 
 for twenty-four dollars. 
 and a map to every gravesite
 where Poe was buried
 before he died.

 We cannot see, hear nor touch; 
 you have nary a clue
 as to what I'm all about, 
 so please don't pretend
 that you know who I am; 
 So, go, now.  


tell your voices, 
 ''stop talking.  

and listen.
 Shhhhh. .. 

I hear a breeze, 
 you hear nothing.  

We are home.
 


Dry autumn leaves
Crackle under my feet-
Dead can feel and speak. 


We have not heard the music of the spheres,
  The song of star to star, but there are sounds
  More deep than human joy and human tears,
  That Nature uses in her common rounds;
  The fall of streams, the cry of winds that strain
  The oak, the roaring of the sea's surge, might
  Of thunder breaking afar off, or rain
  That falls by minutes in the summer night.
  These are the voices of earth's secret soul,
  Uttering the mystery from which she came.
  To him who hears them grief beyond control,
  Or joy inscrutable without a name,
  Wakes in his heart thoughts bedded there, impearled,
  Before the birth and making of the world. 


the pangs of pan freckled 
being thrusted by the rage of fire
out of uncertainty of the time
still in dark side of unknown
what may happen tomorrow

yet latching on to the dream and desire
across the time and space yet not precipitated
passion flies from the dust of the ground 
onto the top of blue dust intoned
 
hovering across the void 
vastness of the sky expanded
twitchy bird flies in quest of breath
keeping all its earthly desire hotshot

folding across its flapping wings
storm may come on its way
flecking all its bated fear along
by the heath of each speckle of hope

the thirst for living of heartland frozen
under deep shadow of tomorrow
yet it returns back in a heartbeats
for its waiting kids hanging over the tree

the wind may thrash them down
along the rain drops
yet it counts the abacus of life
across the blurred voices over black board,.  




The excruciating pain of a thorn
Slitting its point till the bones left torn
Ripping apart flesh that’s left in scripted
Painting pictures of lonesome scenes depicted
Courage and fear it shows the difference
Living my life with thoughts and reference
Leads to a path of such pure essence
Left alone away from all ones presence
Lost in its way of bleeding torment
Left a beating heart in a state that’s dormant
Into darkness it builds its pressure
Under the skin of force gone unmeasured
Ready to erupt at first heats sight
Blinding distant valleys with flashes of light
Ashes that slide down my face for ones beauty
Left in a state of her obscurity
In this valley is where my life will plant
In a place where my volcanic heart is left dormant


Volcanoes be in Sicily
And South America
I judge from my Geography - 
Volcanos nearer here
A Lava step at any time
Am I inclined to climb - 
A Crater I may contemplate
Vesuvius at Home. 

HERE in the quiet eve
My thankful eyes receive
The quiet light.
I see the trees stand fair
Against the faded air,
And star by star prepare
The perfect night.

And in my bosom, lo!
Content and quiet grow
Toward perfect peace.
And now when day is done,
Brief day of wind and sun,
The pure stars, one by one,
Their troop increase.

Keen pleasure and keen grief
Give place to great relief:
Farewell my tears!
Still sounds toward me float;
I hear the bird's small note,
Sheep from the far sheepcote,
And lowing steers.

For lo! the war is done,
Lo, now the battle won,
The trumpets still.
The shepherd's slender strain,
The country sounds again
Awake in wood and plain,
On haugh and hill.

Loud wars and loud loves cease.
I welcome my release;
And hail once more
Free foot and way world-wide.
And oft at eventide
Light love to talk beside
The hostel door. 


Listen darnit and listen hard! 
Catch the echo in the room bouncing off walls 
Echo so heavy, it weighs on your thoughts and feelings
The echoes of human struggle and disparity amongst peoples
Blue, brown, green people, all of us involved
Everyday people faced with issues of inequality and injustice with no help
Everyday people with a heart to learn but no one to teach
The echoes of their struggles reverberating like waves
Waves of people forced into need without help
In our presence are the millions of voices pressed hard against their will 
His cries, her cries, our cries.  
Our echoes so faint from exhaustion it disappears into thin air
These are the faithful called upon to hoist the flag high in the air
Our citizens under duress and now summed to. 
Provide bread on empty stomach
Provide leadership to young ones while himself barely surviving on faint hope. 
On the mere chance that you might hear his story and take him under your wings
'They' before us, the generation tomorrow 
'They' the meek, the weak ones amongst us crying for survival, crying for justice
Your free services brings hope
It wipes away a tear
Not a friendly world
Not a friend in the jungle
But your love opens your heart to us
And give us a friend who we never had or had no other means of having
You taught me math and changed my life and demanded nothing in return
And you took my case and defended me and demanded nothing in return
Bless you if you volunteer your service to those unfortunate ones who cant afford it
Your motto: No 'will' abandoned
The many cries for help with outreached arms you touched
Our thanks and gratitude to you extends to your generations


And the town is frozen solid in a vice,
Trees, walls, snow, beneath a glass.
Over crystal, on slippery tracks of ice,
the painted sleighs and I, together, pass.
And over St Peter’s there are poplars, crows
there’s a pale green dome there that glows,
dim in the sun-shrouded dust.
The field of heroes lingers in my thought,
Kulikovo’s barbarian battleground.
The frozen poplars, like glasses for a toast,
clash now, more noisily, overhead.
As though it was our wedding, and the crowd
were drinking to our health and happiness.
But Fear and the Muse take turns to guard
the room where the exiled poet is banished,
and the night, marching at full pace,
of the coming dawn, has no knowledge. 


Sixteen long years 
Of blood stained 
Marital life bearing
Two offsprings
Painful memories of
Excruciating 
Domestic violence
Puzzling me of my
Faults any contributing
Attempting to 
Correct myself till now
Grateful am I to you
Now as never before. 
More thankful than
Even when you
Spared me from 
Violence when fainted..
Revealing your 
Secret mind 
This moment  bearing
Your ex still afresh; 
And hers still fresh
With yours after
Her long married life
Betraying her
Children's father
With bedazzling flings. 
Forcing me out of
This so called 
Heavenly bondage
Till now a hell bound
Relationship
Since the very day! 
Guilty am I no more
Squeezing my mind
To core searching 
For faults mine. 
But. . 

degrade I 
Your love for her
Having bed with me
Thinking of her
You betraying
Me not but your ex too! 
And your ex
Bearing children
Thinking of you
Betraying her partner! 
Term it you love
And this filthy relationship
A heavenly bondage! 
This recreation
Of mix and match 
In relationships 
Passing away 
His time idle
Posing busy 
Solving world's problems
Created and directed
By the creator himself! ! 

Bending with the wind
Indecision a flowing stream
Usual politics 


Not 'neath the altar only,—yet, in sooth, 
There more than elsewhere,—is the cry, "How long?"
The right sown there hath still borne fruit in wrong—
The wrong waxed fourfold. Thence, (in hate of truth) 
O'er weapons blessed for carnage, to fierce youth 
From evil age, the word hath hissed along:—
Therefore the wine-cup at the altar is 
On the altar-stone, that to man's church, for this, 
Shall prove a stone of stumbling,—whence it stood 
To be rent up ere the true Church be built. 


Pond snipe, bleached pine, rue weed, wart -- 
I walk by sedge and brown river rot 
to where the old lake boats went daily out. 
All the ships are gone, the gray wharf fallen 
in upon itself. Even the channel's 
grown over. Once we set sail here 
for Bob-Lo, the Brewery Isles, Cleveland. 
We would have gone as far as Niagara 
or headed out to open sea if the Captain 
said so, but the Captain drank. Blood-eyed 
in the morning, coffee shaking in his hand, 
he'd plead to be put ashore or drowned, 
but no one heard. Enormous in his long coat, 
Sinbad would take the helm and shout out 
orders swiped from pirate movies. Once 
we docked north of Vermillion to meet 
a single spur of the old Ohio Western 
and sat for days waiting for a train, 
waiting for someone to claim the cargo 
or give us anything to take back, 
like the silver Cadillac roadster 
it was rumored we had once freighted 
by itself. The others went foraging 
and left me with the Captain, locked up 
in the head and sober. Two days passed, 
I counted eighty tankers pulling 
through the flat lake waters on their way, 
I counted blackbirds gathering at dusk 
in the low trees, clustered like bees. 
I counted the hours from noon to noon 
and got nowhere. At last the Captain slept. 
I banked the fire, raised anchor, cast off, 
and jumping ship left her drifting out 
on the black bay. I walked seven miles 
to the Interstate and caught a meat truck 
heading west, and came to over beer, 
hashbrowns, and fried eggs in a cafe 
northwest of Omaha. I could write 
how the radio spoke of war, how 
the century was half its age, how 
dark clouds gathered in the passes 
up ahead, the dispossessed had clogged 
the roads, but none the less I alone 
made my way to the western waters, 
a foreign ship, another life, and disappeared 
from all Id known. In fact I 
come home every year, I walk the same streets 
where I grew up, but now with my boys. 
I settled down, just as you did, took 
a degree in library sciences, 
and got my present position with 
the county. I'm supposed to believe 
something ended. I'm supposed to be 
dried up. I'm supposed to represent 
a yearning, but I like it the way it is. 
Not once has the ocean wind changed 
and brought the taste of salt 
over the coastal hills and through 
the orchards to my back yard. Not once 
have I wakened cold and scared 
out of a dreamless sleep 
into a dreamless life and cried 
and cried out for what I left behind. 


Keep hope alive
Despite despairs drive
To the abyss

Waves of nausea
Suppress pleasure
Muddled snap
Of brain’s trap

In the zone
Or all alone
Memories rustle
Amidst daily bustle
Awaiting the flash
Or reflected backlash

Quite fitting
The unwitting
Take measure
Of lost treasure

Undaunted continue
Fascia and sinew



I had walked since dawn and lay down to rest on a bare hillside
Above the ocean. I saw through half-shut eyelids a vulture wheeling
     high up in heaven,
And presently it passed again, but lower and nearer, its orbit
     narrowing,
     I understood then
That I was under inspection. I lay death-still and heard the flight-
     feathers
Whistle above me and make their circle and come nearer.
I could see the naked red head between the great wings
Bear downward staring. I said, 'My dear bird, we are wasting time
     here.
These old bones will still work; they are not for you.' But how
     beautiful
     he looked, gliding down
On those great sails; how beautiful he looked, veering away in the
     sea-light
     over the precipice. I tell you solemnly
That I was sorry to have disappointed him. To be eaten by that beak
     and
     become part of him, to share those wings and those eyes--
What a sublime end of one's body, what an enskyment; what a life
     after death.

Drake in the North Sea grimly prowling,
Treading his dear _Revenge's_ deck,
Watched, with the sea-dogs round him growling,
Galleons drifting wreck by wreck.
'Fetter and Faith for England's neck,
Faggot and Father, Saint and chain,---
Yonder the Devil and all go howling,
Devon, O Devon, in wind and rain!

Drake at the last off Nombre lying,
Knowing the night that toward him crept,
Gave to the sea-dogs round him crying,
This for a sign before he slept:---
'Pride of the West! What Devon hath kept
Devon shall keep on tide or main;
Call to the storm and drive them flying,
Devon, O Devon, in wind and rain!'

Valour of England gaunt and whitening,
Far in a South land brought to bay,
Locked in a death-grip all day tightening,
Waited the end in twilight gray.
Battle and storm and the sea-dog's way!
Drake from his long rest turned again,
Victory lit thy steel with lightning,
Devon, o Devon, in wind and rain


It was year nineteen sixty-two
Magic girl Waheeda
Of the tinsel town of Bombay
Had young reverberating hearts
Captured in her spell of charms

The haunting melody
"A lamp burnt somewhere
Somewhere a heart"
Flowed everywhere in the air
Monsoon wet
Filled with mist

I was just into college
When her look-alike arrived
In our midst
Same hairdo, veiled
Yet its front-line deliberately unveiled
To let a wisp of lock droop on a wide forehead
Eyes naughty, lovably cocky
Nose chiseled, sharp countenance

A total clone
That had me fallen
Head over heels
In a well of deep infatuation
And burning adoration
"A lamp burnt somewhere
Somewhere a heart"

I stood transfixed
As she passed 
In and out of the college gate
Head bent, yet with a budding smile
That said she knew
Everything happening around

Soon it became a ritual
For me to wait at the gate
Motionless like a pillar
To see her pass by
Day after day 
Without respite

So much so that
I became a part
Of the pompous gate
No one could any more
Tell me apart from it

She knew my presence
I was doubtless
How could my dogged devotion
Miss her attention? ! 
Yet never I could muster
Courage enough
To unbecome the pillar
And utter my heart

My silent worship
Consumed half a decade
Rains came, seasons changed
And every day she passed by
With that same budding smile
Watched by me, the worshipful pile

And on the last day
She looked directly into my eyes
Then bent her head again
Cupping her mouth
To suppress a laugh
And lo! I found her drop
A piece of paper on her path

As I ran with the winds
To capture the note
I saw her vanish from sight
In a darting haste across the street

That was the last
I ever saw of her
Perhaps, she got into wedded life
Hid in a burqa, mothered several kids
Sprayed attar day and night
Humming to motionless pillars in life
"A lamp burnt somewhere
Somewhere a heart"

And don’t you want to know
What her final note had said? 
"Be bold, ye stupid, adieu! "
Me the eternal pile placed at a gate

How vastly separated in space, yet linked by fate, 
these two places are, I reflect, on a winter's day
at Waikumete, reading Don Blanding's elegy, 
which has just forty-three names inscribed on it.
'Copy our names from the list, 'they seem to say, 
'before you return from the mountain top to the plains'.
I remember the morning of November, when
Flight left Auckland for Antarctica, a one-way flight, 
a relic left on the lower slopes of Mt. Erebus.
Erebus-the Son of Chaos, the name of underworld caverns
on the way to hell. 

I seem to be on the dry ice contours of
Ross Island, where the sun never sets: I hear the Preacher say: 
'He is present with us and what may seem like foolishness
but we ask for faith that we may accept what has been done.'

  


Love has gone a-rocketing. 
That is not the worst; 
I could do without the thing, 
And not be the first. 

Joy has gone the way it came. 
That is nothing new; 
I could get along the same, -- 
Many people do. 

Dig for me the narrow bed, 
Now I am bereft. 
All my pretty hates are dead, 
And what have I left


Wail for the sight is Gory, 
Wail for the deaths of these Infants
Wail for the deaths of these women, ; young, and Old
Wail for the loss of the productive workforce of this Nation
Wail for the Calamity that came within few seconds to claim thousands of lives.

Wail for the loss of generations of this Land called Haiti
Wail for the Unconsolable mothers, and fathers for the loss of their loved ones
Wail, if you have tears in your tear glands, 
Wail, if you have heart that is meek
May the Almighty console us all, 
for the sights of the dead in the rubbles too frightening to look. 


Wait, for now.
Distrust everything, if you have to.
But trust the hours.  Haven't they
carried you everywhere, up to now? 
Personal events will become interesting again.
Hair will become interesting.
Pain will become interesting.
Buds that open out of season will become lovely again.
Second-hand gloves will become lovely again,
their memories are what give them
the need for other hands.  And the desolation
of lovers is the same: that enormous emptiness
carved out of such tiny beings as we are
asks to be filled; the need
for the new love is faithfulness to the old.
 
Wait.
Don't go too early.
You're tired. But everyone's tired.
But no one is tired enough.
Only wait a while and listen.
Music of hair,
Music of pain,
music of looms weaving all our loves again.
Be there to hear it, it will be the only time,
most of all to hear,
the flute of your whole existence,
rehearsed by the sorrows, 
play itself into total exhaustion. 


When I see you
my stomach flusters all the time. 
you and only you
are on my mind.
That smile of yours is a gift
Those eyes are percing
when you look at me I forget
my sadness and worries.
I love how you make me
feel and I'll never forget.
Memories of me and you
run through my head
they are my favorite movies.
Sad day came upon me when
you left.
When you left my heart
went with you.
I may have the key to my
heart, but you have my heart.
I remember what you said
you told me I'm a little late.
But I know we are
meant to be
and one day we will again
be together
and until that day
I will wait, and 
only wait for 
you. 


Wait for me my love, for I fear I'm young but fine
Sooner or later we shall make merry and drink wine
We shall joyfully dance around wild fires and rejoice
Because I'm free and would not heed my parents voice
Or are you in a rush just to defile my fine linen bed
Dare you not, else my parents will surely have me dead
My love, my heart, don't ever let us ruin our future 
Someday, Somewhere in time, I'll be your wife for sure
We'll be married together, runaway and even live faraway
So don't be such in a haste to put me in the family way
Waiting for me is perfectly right and can never be wrong
I'll obey my parents although it's with you that I belong
I'll keep myself pure and whole for you and one question
Will you wait for me 'cause in your eyes I see frustration


Wait till the Majesty of Death
Invests so mean a brow!
Almost a powdered Footman
Might dare to touch it now!

Wait till in Everlasting Robes
That Democrat is dressed,
Then prate about "Preferment"—
And "Station," and the rest!

Around this quiet Courtier
Obsequious Angels wait!
Full royal is his Retinue!
Full purple is his state!


To such a Modest Clay
Receives unblushingly

When I am alone I am happy. 
The air is cool. The sky is 
flecked and splashed and wound 
with color. The crimson phalloi 
of the sassafras leaves 
hang crowded before me 
in shoals on the heavy branches. 
When I reach my doorstep 
I am greeted by 
the happy shrieks of my children 
and my heart sinks. 
I am crushed. 

Are not my children as dear to me 
as falling leaves or 
must one become stupid 
to grow older? 
It seems much as if Sorrow 
had tripped up my heels. 
Let us see, let us see! 
What did I plan to say to her 
when it should happen to me 
as it has happened now

Tell me not of forgotten dreams
For dreams are fleeting -
Life's reality holds steadfast, 
No room for dreams now
Only today's stark coldness
Shivers the magical song
That once embraced my heart; 

Tell me not of forgotten hopes
For hopes are fading -
This is all there is now, 
Nothing more than shadow -
Muted watery images
Void of color and sound
No longer breathing life; 

Everything so far away now -
Love scattered on the wind, 
Fragile petals blown and bruised
Dashed and broken  - bleeding
Unrealized, unfulfilled, 
Never to feel your lifeblood



I am a ghost waiting to be reborn. 

Serene, I fold my hands and wait,
    Nor care for wind, nor tide, nor sea;
I rave no more 'gainst time or fate,
    For lo! my own shall come to me.

I stay my haste, I make delays,
    For what avails this eager pace?
I stand amid the eternal ways,
    And what is mine shall know my face.

Asleep, awake, by night or day,
    The friends I seek are seeking me;
No wind can drive my bark astray,
    Nor change the tide of destiny.

What matter if I stand alone?
    I wait with joy the coming years;
My heart shall reap where it hath sown,
    And garner up its fruit of tears.

The waters know their own and draw
    The brook that springs in yonder height;
So flows the good with equal law
    Unto the soul of pure delight.

The stars come nightly to the sky;
    The tidal wave unto the sea;
Nor time, nor space, nor deep, nor high,
    Can keep my own away from me.


Feeling here
I am alone.
Waiting softly
For the phone; 
Waiting for
Someone to call
Knowing that
No on will speak, 
Everyone
Is so weak, 
They fall.

And no one
Comes inside
My feeling, 
I hear shadows
On the ceiling, 
They protect me
From the meaning
And the sounds
Of no one
Screaming, 
For the reason
I am waiting, 
For the phone 
To start ringing.

Waiting here
For anything, 
That will tell me
I am free.
I’m waiting for
My phone to ring. 


The sun has slipped his tether
And galloped down the west.
(Oh, it's weary, weary waiting, love.)
The little bird is sleeping
In the softness of its nest.
Night follows day, day follows dawn,
And so the time has come and gone:
And it's weary, weary waiting, love.

The cruel wind is rising
With a whistle and a wail.
(And it's weary, weary waiting, love.)
My eyes are seaward straining
For the coming of a sail;
But void the sea, and void the beach
Far and beyond where gaze can reach!
And it's weary, weary waiting, love.

I heard the bell-buoy ringing--
How long ago it seems!
(Oh, it's weary, weary waiting, love.)
And ever still, its knelling
Crashes in upon my dreams.
The banns were read, my frock was sewn;
Since then two seasons' winds have blown--
And it's weary, weary waiting, love.

The stretches of the ocean
Are bare and bleak to-day.
(Oh, it's weary, weary waiting, love.)
My eyes are growing dimmer--
Is it tears, or age, or spray?
But I will stay till you come home.
Strange ships come in across the foam!
But it's weary, weary waiting, love. 


You will have to wait. Until it. Until The last owl hoot has quavered to a 

Vibrant silence and you realize thre is no breathing Beside you, and dark curdles toward dawn. Until

Drouth breaks, too late to save the corn, But not too late for flood, and the dog-fox, stranded

On a sudden islet, barks in hysteria in the alder-brake. 


The woman you have lived with all the years Says, without rancor, that life is the way life is, and she

Had never loved you, had believed the lie only for the sake of the children. 

Until you become uncertain of French irregular verbs And by a strange coincidence begin to take Catholic instruction from Monsignor O'Malley, who chews a hangnail. Until

You realize, truly, that our Saviour died for us all, And as tears gather in your eyes, you burst out laughing,

For the joke is certainly on Him, considering What we are. Until

You pick the last alibi off, like a scab, and Admire the inwardness, as beautiful as inflamed flesh

Or summer sunrise. Until you
Remember, suprisingly, that common men have done good deeds. Until it

Has allowed us the grandeur of certain utterances. 



I’m waiting for a message, 
One that should be clear, 
I’m waiting for a message, 
To say he wants me near.

I’m waiting for a sign, 
To show he really cares, 
I’m waiting for a sign, 
To say he wants me there.

I’m waiting for some word, 
To say he’s thinking of me, 
I’m waiting for some word, 
To say he still needs me.

But why should I wait? 
What’s in it for me? 
Should I just sit here, 
And then simply agree? 

With whatever he does, 
With whatever he says, 
With all his opinions, 
In the end, give him praise? 

For coming out with what, 
I knew all along, 
That the time isn’t right, 
And that I am not strong.

Strong enough to say it first, 
Strong enough to tell, 
That things are not right, 
Things aren’t going well.

I shouldn’t wait, 
Nor lament for something lost, 
A love I thought to be true, 
That actually incurred a cost.

Love should be free, 
Lovers free to speak their minds, 
One shouldn’t have to wait, 
Such a love is just unkind. 

It's in the eyes, 
Emerging, 
Young - history green - 
Mystery doesn't play on this occasion; 

Elegance does -
Lays foundation -
Dignity is all, 
Underpinning dare with balance: 
The veil to sight, diaphanous at best - 
Not so the inner one. 

That look longs for settlement, 
Hides a room - empty for the moment -
Door ajar, yet hinges tight: 
Urge of womanhood is
Waiting in a lonely glass of wine: 

How long to hide -? 
Hanging on a move
To break the vestiges of matrimony.

An urge trickles to the surface: 
Still another wall! Thicker! 
When to flood the space with bloom, 
Advertise that slenderness of arm? -
Flout her personality; 

But readiness for taking simmers cool, 
Falters back to nascence -
Fear of fighting fights with desperation. 

Beauty at the bar - 
Brown flits of eye -
A flash of yet-to-be, 
Wine shared.

& the calendar changed
Waiting for the right thing
When time looked strange.

Students wait for holidays
So they can have fun
Officers wait for promotion
Hoping the day will soon come.

Farmers wait for harvest
So they can feed
For your lunch and dinner
They are the ones to bleed

Waiting is not just hope
Its patience, faith and devote.
It's a belief you know will come true
Your wait; will bring a minute to you

Whatever you wait
You will find
Cause it's written in your destiny
And it's underlined. 


The other frogs consider me aloof
And mock each out-of-season mating call,
But I regard my plight as living proof
That faith can foster something magical.
So crouching patiently above the scum
With chin uplifted, eyelids low and still,
I wait for my redeeming love to come.

With numbing numbers cruelly reduced
To caviar for snacking perch and trout,
Dessert for weary birds before they roost
Or toys that idle boys have caught for sport,
It all confirms my sense of destiny.
Someday she will appear to grace this plot
And recognize the manifest in me. 

What things for dream there are when spectre-like, 
Moving among tall haycocks lightly piled, 
I enter alone upon the stubble field, 
From which the laborers' voices late have died, 
And in the antiphony of afterglow 
And rising full moon, sit me down 
Upon the full moon's side of the first haycock 
And lose myself amid so many alike. 
I dream upon the opposing lights of the hour, 
Preventing shadow until the moon prevail; 
I dream upon the night-hawks peopling heaven, 
Each circling each with vague unearthly cry, 
Or plunging headlong with fierce twang afar; 
And on the bat's mute antics, who would seem 
Dimly to have made out my secret place, 
Only to lose it when he pirouettes, 
And seek it endlessly with purblind haste; 
On the last swallow's sweep; and on the rasp 
In the abyss of odor and rustle at my back, 
That, silenced by my advent, finds once more, 
After an interval, his instrument, 
And tries once-twice-and thrice if I be there; 
And on the worn book of old-golden song 
I brought not here to read, it seems, but hold 
And freshen in this air of withering sweetness; 
But on the memory of one absent most, 
For whom these lines when they shall greet her eye. 


These are my two drops of rain
Waiting on the window-pane. 

I am waiting here to see
Which the winning one will be. 

Both of them have different names.
One is John and one is James.

All the best and all the worst
Comes from which of them is first.

James has just begun to ooze.
He's the one I want to lose.

John is waiting to begin.
He's the one I want to win.

James is going slowly on.
Something sort of sticks to John.

John is moving off at last.
James is going pretty fast.

John is rushing down the pane.
James is going slow again.

James has met a sort of smear.
John is getting very near.

Is he going fast enough?
(James has found a piece of fluff.)

John has quickly hurried by.
(James was talking to a fly.)

John is there, and John has won! 
Look! I told you! Here's the sun


Twilight fell  on your
sorrowful  waiting eyes! 
The snowy field, the horizon
and you, in the solitariness
cherished to hug life with 
its warmth and coziness.
No wind to whisper in
your alert ears, 
The sound of living world, 
was blocked to drown
you in glued stillness.
I read the sadness in your
soft, tender eyes, 
waiting not only 
for the preys, 
but to be hunted
by a beloved huntress

tired and hungry the beast still hunts me
he stalks in the shadows as life grows shallow
waiting for the days to get shorter so he can begin his slaughter
with hatred in his eye but his job on his mind
all i can do is waste this precious time
in other words im the hunted or even the prey
with nothing to do but wait for the hunter to come out and play
so to lead this good life he just might tempt me
for above or below i dont know where he will send me
but my faith in all of that is even a question
i think if something goes wrong is it a sign or just another life lesson
is my life even a blessing
but if i dont believe, when things go wrong why do i curse everything thats above
or prey so many times for another chance at love
but back to my stalking enemy or is he my walking friend
you see i feel like the last word in a sentence and my paragraph has come to an end
so instead of embracing life i wait for it to stop
tick tock tick tock


I had this dream
That keep occurring to me
Bout you Marc Anthony
And why you take so fucking long until you let yourself be seen

I been waitin all life
For this dream to come alive
Now I gotta be waitin with a knife
Babe I'd like to be your wife

Ain't it dope livin in this luxury
Smokin and f***ing is all we need
Forget these bitches and get with me

With bated breaths, 
Watering mouths, 
Claws stretched taut, 
and hungry, black-brown bodies, 
These hungry vultures 
stare around them, 
Waiting excitedly for dead bodies, 
To fall on the ground, 
In a town where sparrows
and smaller birds 
are disappearing, 
The ponds and lakes are drying 
The migratory birds have stopped visiting, 
The wild animals are gored to death, 
And the air is filling up
With poisonous gases.  

A memory of your life, A memory of your death
Will not be forgotten, You taking your last breath
The breath for life that failed today
Your life.  Now taken away
It is now memories that help me to remain strong
Though not really knowing what went wrong
Wrong yes! But mappped out when born
Hard to accept and needing to mourn
As we mourn each day the memories heal
Accepting what, what is now real
You must never give up on life. 

As it is the death that makes us stronger
Even though you are no longer
No longer with me. Yet waiting for me, 
Waiting for my turn to take my journey



when everything came down to
one moment

so I turned back
not knowing you had
already gone through the

gate

I retraced everthing: 
the storm that took me

away

the house unhinged

the miracle of a safe landing.
and the green wish hidden

in your eyes

bought milk, bread and eggs, 
bought dog food, cat food, hamburger, 
hot dogs, buns, mayonnaise, ravioli, 
cheese, toilet paper, of course, 
bought cigarettes and scotch, the staples.
Gotta have the staples.
 
Gassed up the truck and parked it at the end
of the driveway, way out of the way 
of the monster snow plows, that can burry
a small house by just passing by.

Got out the snow shovel, brought in
the dogs, changed the litter box, 
made dinner, fed the dogs and cleaned
the dishes. 

Now, if the snow would just come, 
I could rest. 

Though cloudy skies, and northern blasts,
Retard the gentle spring awhile;
The sun will conqu'ror prove at last,
And nature wear a vernal smile. 

The promise, which from age to age,
Has brought the changing seasons round;
Again shall calm the winter's rage,
Perfume the air, and paint the ground. 

The virtue of that first command,
I know still does, and will prevail;
That while the earth itself shall stand,
The spring and summer shall not fail. 

Such changes are for us decreed;
Believers have their winters too;
But spring shall certainly succeed,
And all their former life renew. 

Winter and spring have each their use,
And each, in turn, his people know;
One kills the weeds their hearts produce,
The other makes their graces grow. 

Though like dead trees awhile they seem,
Yet having life within their root,
The welcome spring's reviving beam
Draws forth their blossoms, leaves, and fruit. 

But if the tree indeed be dead,
It feels no change, though spring return,
Its leafless naked, barren head,
Proclaims it only fit to burn. 

Thou know'st our winter has been long;
Shine forth, and warm our hearts to sing,
And thy rich grace shall be our song. 

waiting for the light to change small things occur to you
and the bees of drizzle gather under your umbrella
walk, flickers the ivoried, don't cross yells the sign in

of what seems to be the mood of those
waiting for the years in review

but you're just in love with the color guards
with all the traffic green and red punctuation

and the bees of drizzle fly away just
as the light turns to amber; 
and the sun comes out in your soul on a winter day
where the blue birds gather their little prisms

from the long ago
and painters gather on the Seine
for one lost lingering impression

perhaps before the hives of gold have hatched
for them
haloed, the honey of their tears

i felt carried by the fog.
and the fog knew  it.
So they carried me.

I walked and walked
until I reached the pure white skies.
They carried me and brought me
to the gates of heaven.

There I waited and waited 
for those emotional moments
to receive me to lead me


I've been waiting night and day. 
I didn't see the time, 
I waited half my life away. 
There were lots of invitations 
and I know you sent me some, 
but I was waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
I know you really loved me. 
but, you see, my hands were tied. 
I know it must have hurt you, 
it must have hurt your pride 
to have to stand beneath my window 
with your bugle and your drum, 
and me I'm up there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
Ah I don't believe you'd like it, 
You wouldn't like it here. 
There ain't no entertainment 
and the judgements are severe. 
The Maestro says it's Mozart 
but it sounds like bubble gum 
when you're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
Waiting for the miracle 
There's nothing left to do. 
I haven't been this happy 
since the end of World War II. 
Nothing left to do 
when you know that you've been taken. 
Nothing left to do 
when you're begging for a crumb 
Nothing left to do 
when you've got to go on waiting 
waiting for the miracle to come. 
I dreamed about you, baby. 
It was just the other night. 
Most of you was naked 
Ah but some of you was light. 
The sands of time were falling 
from your fingers and your thumb, 
and you were waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come 
Ah baby, let's get married, 
we've been alone too long. 
Let's be alone together. 
Let's see if we're that strong. 
Yeah let's do something crazy, 
something absolutely wrong 
while we're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
Nothing left to do.  
When you've fallen on the highway 
and you're lying in the rain, 
and they ask you how you're doing 
of course you'll say you can't complain -  
If you're squeezed for information, 
that's when you've got to play it dumb: 
You just say you're out there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

I watch as the world falls away
I cant change it, no matter what I say
I feel as sanity slips through my fingers
No matter what I do the damage still lingers

It's the same thing over and over again
It's like a battle,against a million men
Theres no winning, theres no hope at all
All you can do is sit and watch the world fall

Destruction and corrosion, destroy the world
Take it all in. Breath held, Toes curled
Waiting for the world to turn to nothing
Hoping. 

'If only I could have done something'

Watch with sorrow filled eyes. Mother nature
Watch as they die, all of the wonderful creatures
They'll all fall.  

polluted water and birds with no trees.
children killed so young as mothers fall to their knees

We don't deserve it. All this time we've spat in His face
everything we've destroyed.  

time cant heal this cut
trying to convince ourselves, we'll get out of this rut

The world is falling and nobody cares
The world is crying and nobody hears
Its too late now the damage is done
The battle is over and destruction has won

waiting in pain I reach for the sky 
waiting in pain I watch

you fly high 
on the ground is where


I stay
'get up get up' your voice will say

drowning in failur and choked by faith 
in pain is where ill wait
you tried to help me you showed me love 
and care it turns out the love was never there

you brought me pain 
my heart was slain 
so now I  wait I wait in pain


I stare into a lonely nighttime puddle
'Don't Worry' tattoo'd on her right wrist; 
'Be Happy' on the left
-She puts out a cigarette
in the mushy ashtry outside
and i watch her as she walks back
into the organized chaos

Sometimes her mouth is sad 
around the edges; 
She's over-worked-
people's rudeness has
made her half life-starved
.. 

But also, half life-charged-
-And it gives her all the more
reason to dream of living in India, 
praying under stars

Her small, graceful hands
set glasses on tables
with feline precission and care-
The hands of a hard worker

Feet aching in food-spattered shoes
; A vegetarian serving prime rib to strangers

But.  

besides the over-worked drowsiness
and sadness in her face
there are hints of insight; 
peace; joy; wit;


and
Wonder in her eyes

She steps into each new moment
as if on a journey
, or a mission. 
; A pilgrimage  -

She playfully curses her friends, 
(and the regular customers)   
Flaunts a twenty-dollar tip, 
and skips away with a giggle that sounds
much younger than she is  -

Some waitresses have Eternity
and Buddha
and Compassion
in their footsteps, 
in their eyes, in their hands, 
and in their smiles. 

Tell all my mourners
To mourn in red --
Cause there ain't no sense
In my bein' dead. 

Nicodemus, the slave was of African birth,
And was bought for a bagful of gold;
He was reckon'd as part of the salt of the earth,
But he died years ago, very old.
'Twas his last sad request as we laid him away
In the trunk of an old hollow tree;
"Wake me up!" was his charge, "at the first break of day --
Wake me up for the great Jubilee!"

The "Good Time Coming" is almost here!
It was long, long, long on the way!
Now run and tell Elijah to hurry up Pump,
And meet me at the gumtree in the swamp
To wake Nicodemus today.

He was known as a prophet -- at least was as wise --
For he told of the battles to come;
And we trembled with dread when he roll'd up his eyes,
And we heeded the shake of his thumb.
Though he clothed us with fear, yet the garments he wore
Were in patches at elbow and knees;
And he still wears the suit that he used to of yore,
As he sleeps in the old hollow tree.

Nicodemus was never the sport of the lash,
Though the bullet has oft cross'd his path;
There were none of his masters so brave or so rash
As to face such a man in his wrath.
Yet his great heart with kindness was filled to the brim --
He obeyed who was born to command;
But he long'd for the morning which then was so dim --
For the morning which now is at hand.

'Twas a long weary night -- we were almost in fear
That the future was more than he knew;
'Twas a long weary night -- but the morning is near,
And the words of our prophet are true.
There are signs in the sky that the darkness is gone --
There are tokens in endless array;
While the storm which had seemingly banished the dawn,
Only hastens the advent of day. 

Wake not for the world-heard thunder, 
Nor the chimes that earthquakes toll; 
Stars may plot in heaven with planet, 
Lightning rive the rock of granite, 
Tempest tread the oakwood under, 
Fear not you for flesh or soul; 
Marching, fighting, victory past, 
Stretch your limbs in peace at last. 

Stir not for the soldier's drilling, 
Nor the fever nothing cures; 
Throb of drum and timbal's rattle 
Call but men alive to battle, 
And the fife with death-notes filling 
Screams for blood--but not for yours. 
Times enough you bled your best; 
Sleep on now, and take your rest. 

Sleep, my lad; the French have landed, 
London's burning, Windsor's down. 
Clasp your cloak of earth about you; 
We must man the ditch without you, 
March unled and fight short-handed, 
Charge to fall and swim to drown. 
Duty, friendship, bravery o'er, 
Sleep away, lad; wake no more. 


Wake the serpent not—lest he
Should not know the way to go,--
Let him crawl which yet lies sleeping
Through the deep grass of the meadow!
Not a bee shall hear him creeping, 
Not a may-fly shall awaken
From its cradling blue-bell shaken,
Not the starlight as he’s sliding
Through the grass with silent gliding. 

Wake up! 
From your unyielding prestige
That made you abortive
And you turned into a nefarious sculpt.

Wake up! 
From your morbid thoughts
That made you an introvert
And you became a virulent foe of your own flesh.

Wake up! 
And rectify your delusions, 
Nurture yourself
To glow again.

Wake up! 
And wipe off the smog from your eyes, 
Chase the overrated world
To be a paragon.

Wake up! 
And don't muddle yourself anymore
A gleam of hope still remains, therefore, 
Wake up! Take up! ! 





It's a task and burden on our shoulders. 

We need peace, freedom and humanity. 
So we can live a tranquil life with a complete sanity. 
I hope Islam would spread everywhere. 
From its properties the fairness, I swear. 

The sky, the birds and the air were created free. 
They were not bound and neither are we! 


Wake up, 
brush it off, 
work it out, 
skin-so-soft. 

Make-up, 
brush my hair, 
work all day, 
in my chair. 

Fake love, 
rush the night, 
in my dreams, 
can't wait till light. 

Make love, 
rush my life, 
wait for you, 
to be your wife. 

Even the man who is happy
glimpses something
or a hair of sound touches him

and his heart overflows with a longing
he does not recognize

then it must be that he is remembering
in a place out of reach
shapes he has loved

in a life before this
the print of them still there in him waiting


Even in the cave of the night when you
wake and are free and lonely,
neglected by others, discarded, loved only
by what doesn't matter--even in that
big room no one can see,
you push with your eyes till forever
comes in its twisted figure eight
and lies down in your head.

You think water in the river;
you think slower than the tide in
the grain of the wood; you become
a secret storehouse that saves the country,
so open and foolish and empty.

You look over all that the darkness
ripples across. More than has ever
been found comforts you. You open your
eyes in a vault that unlocks as fast
and as far as your thought can run.
A great snug wall goes around everything,
has always been there, will always
remain. It is a good world to be
lost in. It comforts you. It is
all right. And you sleep. 

Like a flip of a switch
and 
shutdown
visions and voices fade
then 
voices become disembodied
and vision surreals
allowed to just melt away
unimportant, disconnected
And as the world falls away
I contemplate my own sanity
with panic and calm
as I know
allowances to let go like this
erodes reason and will
with each instance
with each time I BECKON it. 
I'm profoundly aware of its power
and promise
sweetly, alarmingly seducing me
deeper
I'm swallowed in, 
with a dark and intense curiosity
I go deeper each time
each breath
riding the waves of pain
and pleasure. 
What I come for, 
and what makes it harder to ever leave. 

And it is here
I am with you
and no one can stop me.

November ast night, again, I dreamed 
my children were back at home, 
small boys huddled in their separate beds, 
and I went from one to the other 
listening to their breathing -- regular, 
almost soundless -- until a white light 
hardened against the bedroom wall, 
the light of Los Angeles burning south 
of here, going at last as we 
knew it would. I didn't waken. 
Instead the four of us went out 
into the front yard and the false dawn 
that rose over the Tehachipis and stood 
in our bare feet on the wet lawn 
as the world shook like a burning house. 
Each human voice reached us 
without sound, a warm breath on the cheek, 
a dry kiss. 
                  Why am I so quiet? 
This is the end of the world, I am dreaming 
the end of the world, and I go from bed 
to bed bowing to the small damp heads 
of my sons in a bedroom that turns 
slowly from darkness to fire. Everyone 
else is gone, their last words 
reach us in the language of light. 
The great eucalyptus trees along the road 
swim in the new wind pouring 
like water over the mountains. Each day 
this is what we waken to, a water 
like wind bearing the voices of the world, 
the generations of the unborn chanting 
in the language of fire. This will be 
tomorrow. Why am I so quiet

The night attendant, a B. 

U. sophomore,
rouses from the mare's-nest of his drowsy head
propped on 
The Meaning of Meaning.
He catwalks down our corridor.
Azure day
makes my agonized blue window bleaker.
Crows maunder on the petrified fairway.
Absence! My hearts grows tense
as though a harpoon were sparring for the kill.
(This is the house for the "mentally ill

")

What use is my sense of humour?
I grin at Stanley, now sunk in his sixties,
once a Harvard all-American fullback,
(if such were possible!)
still hoarding the build of a boy in his twenties,
as he soaks, a ramrod
with a muscle of a seal
in his long tub,
vaguely urinous from the Victorian plumbing.
A kingly granite profile in a crimson gold-cap,
worn all day, all night, 
he thinks only of his figure,
of slimming on sherbert and ginger ale--
more cut off from words than a seal.
This is the way day breaks in Bowditch Hall at Mc


Lean's;
the hooded night lights bring out "Bobbie,"
Porcellian '
a replica of Louis XVI
without the wig--
redolent and roly-poly as a sperm whale,
as he swashbuckles about in his birthday suit
and horses at chairs.

These victorious figures of bravado ossified young.

In between the limits of day,
hours and hours go by under the crew haircuts
and slightly too little nonsensical bachelor twinkle
of the Roman Catholic attendants.
(There are no Mayflower
screwballs in the Catholic Church.)

After a hearty New England breakfast,
I weigh two hundred pounds
this morning. Cock of the walk,
I strut in my turtle-necked French sailor's jersey
before the metal shaving mirrors,
and see the shaky future grow familiar
in the pinched, indigenous faces
of these thoroughbred mental cases,
twice my age and half my weight.
We are all old-timers,
each of us holds a locked razor. 

We open our 
Eyes only 
because 
is giving us 
One 
More  
Chance. 

White fog lifting & falling on mountain-brow 
Trees moving in rivers of wind 
The clouds arise 
as on a wave, gigantic eddy lifting mist 
above teeming ferns exquisitely swayed 
along a green crag 
glimpsed thru mullioned glass in valley raine— 


Bardic, O Self, Visitacione, tell naught 
but what seen by one man in a vale in Albion, 
of the folk, whose physical sciences end in Ecology, 
the wisdom of earthly relations, 
of mouths & eyes interknit ten centuries visible 
orchards of mind language manifest human, 
of the satanic thistle that raises its horned symmetry 
flowering above sister grass-daisies’ pink tiny 
bloomlets angelic as lightbulbs— 


Remember miles from London’s symmetrical thorned tower 
& network of TV pictures flashing bearded your Self 
the lambs on the tree-nooked hillside this day bleating 
heard in Blake’s old ear, & the silent thought of Wordsworth in eld Stillness 
clouds passing through skeleton arches of Tintern Abbey— 
Bard Nameless as the Vast, babble to Vastness! 


All the Valley quivered, one extended motion, wind 
undulating on mossy hills 
a giant wash that sank white fog delicately down red runnels 
on the mountainside 
whose leaf-branch tendrils moved asway 
in granitic undertow down— 
and lifted the floating Nebulous upward, and lifted the arms of the trees 
and lifted the grasses an instant in balance 
and lifted the lambs to hold still 
and lifted the green of the hill, in one solemn wave 


A solid mass of Heaven, mist-infused, ebbs thru the vale, 
a wavelet of Immensity, lapping gigantic through Llanthony Valley, 
the length of all England, valley upon valley under Heaven’s ocean 
tonned with cloud-hang, 
—Heaven balanced on a grassblade. 
Roar of the mountain wind slow, sigh of the body, 
One Being on the mountainside stirring gently 
Exquisite scales trembling everywhere in balance, 
one motion thru the cloudy sky-floor shifting on the million feet of daisies, 
one Majesty the motion that stirred wet grass quivering 
to the farthest tendril of white fog poured down 
through shivering flowers on the mountain’s head— 


No imperfection in the budded mountain, 
Valleys breathe, heaven and earth move together, 
daisies push inches of yellow air, vegetables tremble, 
grass shimmers green 
sheep speckle the mountainside, revolving their jaws with empty eyes, 
horses dance in the warm rain, 
tree-lined canals network live farmland, 
blueberries fringe stone walls on hawthorn’d hills, 
pheasants croak on meadows haired with fern— 


Out, out on the hillside, into the ocean sound, into delicate gusts of wet air, 
Fall on the ground, O great Wetness, O Mother, No harm on your body! 
Stare close, no imperfection in the grass, 
each flower Buddha-eye, repeating the story, 
myriad-formed— 
Kneel before the foxglove raising green buds, mauve bells dropped 
doubled down the stem trembling antennae, 
& look in the eyes of the branded lambs that stare 
breathing stockstill under dripping hawthorn— 
I lay down mixing my beard with the wet hair of the mountainside, 
smelling the brown vagina-moist ground, harmless, 
tasting the violet thistle-hair, sweetness— 
One being so balanced, so vast, that its softest breath 
moves every floweret in the stillness on the valley floor, 
trembles lamb-hair hung gossamer rain-beaded in the grass, 
lifts trees on their roots, birds in the great draught 
hiding their strength in the rain, bearing same weight, 


Groan thru breast and neck, a great Oh! to earth heart 
Calling our Presence together 
The great secret is no secret 
Senses fit the winds, 
Visible is visible, 
rain-mist curtains wave through the bearded vale, 
gray atoms wet the wind’s kabbala 
Crosslegged on a rock in dusk rain, 
rubber booted in soft grass, mind moveless, 
breath trembles in white daisies by the roadside, 
Heaven breath and my own symmetric 
Airs wavering thru antlered green fern 
drawn in my navel, same breath as breathes thru Capel-Y-Ffn, 
Sounds of Aleph and Aum 
through forests of gristle, 
All Albion one. 



What did I notice? Particulars! The 
vision of the great One is myriad— 
smoke curls upward from ashtray, 
house fire burned low, 
The night, still wet & moody black heaven 
starless 
upward in motion with wet wind. 

Walk along this path with me
Through fields of thought, 
Though I have not
The answers that you seek, 

I reach my hand to you, my friend
Please come along, 
I'm not the song
Or melody you sing, 

But there are sights along the way
You have not seen
They lie between
All you have seen before, 

Their beauty takes your breath away
They leave their mark
Upon your heart
And melt into your soul; 

I offer you my hand to hold, 
I'll light the way
If you should stray, 
You'll not be lost for long

For I shall wait and never leave, 
My heart I give
That you may live
The grandest life you've known; 

Please walk along this path with me -
Just one step now, 
I'll show you how.
Come and take my hand.



Does she know how I feel about you, 
Does she know when you get lonely how you think about me, your life and your friends, 
Does she know your weakness like how I know, 
I can’t explain this, 
How I think about this everyday, 
Baby I am going to walk away, 
I am going to remember you, your going to remember me, 
Do you know how much I love you, 
I can’t explain this feeling, 
I am going to walk away, 
Walk away from this, 
I am going to remember you, your going to remember me, 
I know I shouldn’t be thinking this, 
Does she even know how your life been, 
How you and I text each other everyday, 
Hoping that one day you’ll come back, 
I know that I should be walking away from this, 
I know this will drive me crazy, 
I can’t help but think about you, 
How we used to be, 
We know she will never like I do, 
It gets to hard for us to walk away, 
Can’t help but to love you, 
You drive me crazy, 
Can’t walk away, 
I am going to remember you, your going to remember. 


I watch you walk away from me
and you never even see
all the tears I cry
all the times I lie
you're supposed to be there
but you're not, and it's not fair! 
you've never said it's over between us
but I don't know if I can trust
that I can keep you here with me
I mean, seriously! 
you're wanted by so many
you're like a shiny new penny
and I don't know if I could take it
if you're just faking it
you've never seen me cry
but you've heard me lie
I want us to be close
but how, I don't know
you walk away from me
and you never even see
all the pain inside me



What more do you want
You can’t have anything else
I know my love overflows 
But it’s never enough
It’s not a heart break 
Honestly I needed a break
Would often have to sit down 
Cause I can’t stand you
Together through thick and thin
Fights grew thick and laughs would thin, 
We let little lies teach us
The truth gone learn
Somewhere between the love letters
And four letter words 
We got off of good terms
And I know that the bad burns
But this time I'mma let it




Walk beside me when I am weak
hold my hand when I feel meek. 
Be my friend when no one's there
free me from the burdens I can not bare.
Oh how I want to believe you're true
show me love in all that I do.
Tell me I'm a special girl
show me how to give life a whirl.
Pull me up when I fall down
or when someone throws me to the ground.
Feel my heart, timid and scared 
Show me the truth when I think no one has cared.
Show me your glory and power and love
untie these wings, help me fly like a dove.
Rock me gently when I feel fear.
listen to me, I want you to hear.
Tell me that my dreams will come true
teach me how to live like you.
Grab my hand and pull me along 
even when I do it wrong.
Show me the world how its meant to be seen
teach me not everyone is harsh and mean.
Hold me up when I'm sad and weary 
calm me down in my times of fury. 
Don't try to tame me, instead run along side
swim with me through the ocean's tide.
Climb with me throughout the mountains
splash with me in life's beautiful fountains.
Show me the rainbow, teach me love's true
tell me it's waiting for me and for you. 


As you begin your journey
To start a brand new day
Thoughts of what might happen
You continued on your way
Walk by faith

Got in your car
Then began to think
Started to ponder
What lies up yonder
Walk by faith

Went for a short ride
Just to clear your head
Stopped at the red light
Mind filled with dread
Walk by faith

You got out the car
Then shut the door
Breathed a sigh of relief
That's what faith is for
Walk by faith

Got home safe and sound
Sat and relaxed for awhile
You started to look around
Then thought with a smile
Walk by faith

Where is your faith? 
Then thou saith
I walk by faith
I walk by faith
 
'Walk by Faith'


Pray in the depth of the night.

In the darkness of the desert, 
sink yourself into nothingness.

Sit alone until you see the light
in your soul filling you with joy. 

Walk with me for a while, 
Throw your glum, and please, smile-
Our heaven is not very near.
See there a grove of pine, 
Standing calmly with green shine.
Hold my hand and take me there.
Are you angry? No, chuckle on your face, 
I also want life and your tight embrace! 
Two ways are there, which one to share? 
Ah! the lonely, thready, still lane, 
Inviting us, to shed our strain-
Let's walk thru the rain-soaked pine and fir
For us now, divinity is in everything, 
Whatever, exists here, and He does bring- 
Nothing is extremely unfair.
So, flash with delight, and take stroll, 
Celestial abode of love is our final goal

Being walkers with the dawn and morning,
Walkers with the sun and morning,
We are not afraid of night,
Nor days of gloom,
Nor darkness--
Being walkers with the sun and morning. 


Walkie Boots

New walkie boots I bought today
I need to test drive them in some way
up the hills and down the glens
over the mountains and back again.

Across the rivers or by the sea
Across the fields of cows and sheep
jumping mucky trofts and creeks
making sure the boots don't leak.

Walks the dog around the loch
no wet feet, no smelly socks
the walkie boots have done their job
kept my feet all snug and warm.

We survived the test today
we live to wander another day
my walkie boots are here to stay
they make my feet happy in every way. 


Just keep on walking whatever u don't look back cause when you do the memory of the past will haunt you, 
You had done enough damage towards me, 
I will keep on walking till the sun goes down until the night shades above and beyond the sky, 
I am moving on with this life, 
I can’t bare it no more but the thoughts of you still haunts me, 
I will keep on walking until there is no more you, 
I know I can’t run forever, 
Soon or later I have to face my demons, 
My demons are you, 
You the one that makes me want to run till I give up, 
Walking away from this pain might not last forever, 
Please quit haunting me, 
Leave me be, 
I want face my demons but too scared but to think of running, 
You made me this way, 
Soon I will face you when I am more ready. 


I wait for the holiday crowd to clear the beach
before stepping onto the first wave.

Soon I am walking across the Atlantic
thinking about Spain,
checking for whales, waterspouts.
I feel the water holding up my shifting weight.
Tonight I will sleep on its rocking surface.


But for now I try to imagine what
this must look like to the fish below,
the bottoms of my feet appearing, disappearing. 

Walking among the sheep, 
watching how peaceful they graze, 
thought of men and women
Who die because of worry.

Hatred brings peacelessness.
Egoistic attitudes kill peace of mind.

Make this world a place of peace.
Become humble and smile always.

Look at the sheep and learn
beautiful lessons of  life.




It so happens I am sick of being a man.
And it happens that I walk into tailorshops and movie
houses
dried up, waterproof, like a swan made of felt
steering my way in a water of wombs and ashes.

The smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse
sobs.
The only thing I want is to lie still like stones or wool.
The only thing I want is to see no more stores, no gardens,
no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators.


It so happens that I am sick of my feet and my nails
and my hair and my shadow.
It so happens I am sick of being a man.

Still it would be marvelous
to terrify a law clerk with a cut lily,
or kill a nun with a blow on the ear.
It would be great
to go through the streets with a green knife
letting out yells until I died of the cold.

I don't want to go on being a root in the dark,
insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep,
going on down, into the moist guts of the earth,
taking in and thinking, eating every day.

I don't want so much misery.
I don't want to go on as a root and a tomb,
alone under the ground, a warehouse with corpses,
half frozen, dying of grief.

That's why Monday, when it sees me coming
with my convict face, blazes up like gasoline,
and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel,
and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the
night.


And it pushes me into certain corners, into some moist
houses,
into hospitals where the bones fly out the window,
into shoeshops that smell like vinegar,
and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin.

There are sulphur-colored birds, and hideous intestines
hanging over the doors of houses that I hate,
and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot,
there are mirrors
that ought to have wept from shame and terror,
there are umbrellas everywhere, and venoms, and umbilical
cords.

I stroll along serenely, with my eyes, my shoes,
my rage, forgetting everything,
I walk by, going through office buildings and orthopedic
shops,
and courtyards with washing hanging from the line:
underwear, towels and shirts from which slow
dirty tears are falling. 


How easy it was, 
To walk away, 
How easy it was, 
You chose not to stay.

How easy it was, 
To make me a fool, 
I thought you were nice, 
I thought you weren’t cruel? 

It seems I don’t know you, 
Don’t know you at all, 
It seems you’ve moved on, 
As I continue to fall.

Never mind dear, 
Life does go on, 
It just goes to show, 
How we can be wrong.

I’ll pick myself up, 
As I always do, 
Yesterday I loved, 
Today I am through.

Can’t take anymore, 
Can’t see you again, 
Can’t live with the pain, 
I have to say then.

Don’t go where I go, 
Don’t call me or write, 
Don’t come to my dreams, 
In the middle of the night.

Don’t think of me, 
On rainy days, 
Don’t use me again, 
In horrible ways.

To bring me some peace, 
To make my heart glad, 
That we were good friends, 
It wasn’t a fad.

It wasn’t a phase, 
That I had gone through, 
For me it was real, 
For me it was true.

So leave me alone, 
To live happy views, 
I’m done being nice, 
Done trying to amuse.

Just stay away, 
This is all that I ask, 
Now can you do that? 
Just do this last task. 


A little bent and unsteady on her feet, 
A silver haired lady slipped into her seat.
Her companion helped and looked at her face
They exchanged an animated, mischievous glance-

they had come to their favourite restuarant to dine.
An ice bucket held a bottle of champagne and red wine.
Enjoy the evening,  captain bowed and moved away.
Shall we order your favourite steak, what do you say? 

Settled, they waved to the crowd- just then the band
Began to play an old number- they seemed glad
A memorable song-, he asked her shall we dance? 
She hesitated and said mockingly, what at my age-

I watched wistfully from the corner of my eyes.
Then the man got up, today, I would like to buy
Drinks for everyone, our children are away, 
We want to celebrate with ones here today.

The goblets of wine were merrily passed around.
Toasts raised in boisterous, sing song sounds-
they seemed young and lively, no old age blues
Seeing them, I thought it sure has its soft golden hues. 


Walking in the sky, 
A man in strange black garb 
Encountered a radiant form. 
Then his steps were eager; 
Bowed he devoutly. 
But the spirit knew him not. 

Must I walk on eggshells
Be carefull what I say
Just be sweet
Avoid the heat
And hold the hounds at bay; 

Keep my thoughts within me
Avoid a nasty scene
Zip my lip
Or let it rip
But try not to be mean; 

You're asking quite a favor
Not sure I can comply
I won't be shushed
My buttons pushed
I cannot tell a lie; 

I will not walk on eggshells
I have a perfect right
To spill my guts
I may be nuts
But I don't want to fight; 

So let's just call a truce here
Agree to disagree
I love you still
I always will
But please, let me be me. 

walking on the jewels of your silence
I saw the winter sky come down
enfolding a long-ago radiance.

a child turns the page
and traces the angels.

you scattered amethyst on the snow
turning my pockets overnight

brightness, you called it: 
will it fly away? 

once I was living on the fair isle
where I learned to say: 
those must be angels coming down
with diamonds in their hands. 

there are deeper ripples in the air
where music was before.
my dreams are banked so high
where could I turn to start again
the porcelain beginning of the measure? 

the first rung in the sidewalk.

my dreams are banked so high.
my dream is leaving this way

just as the glaze begins to fall apart
on a pale green piano piece
not yet memorized-

Gloom, age rolls in empty days.
Raked dust, blows hot and cold.

Winds smirk at olden spears, 
vacant, lifeless huddled hearts, 
slumped, in caves of laden fears.

Swollen eyes in a blinding haze.
Enshrouds, gasping weary souls, 
shifts, tiny dunes to mortal maze.

Banshees', baleful shriek that rips.
weighted, beaten, folded shanks, 
pitching, worn out desert ships.

Unmet baffled tender cares, 
sallow, spirits muddled in lows, 
beaten, bound in fiendish snares.

Stifled, choked in dusty storms.
Broken, strides to weary trudge.
Smitten, smile at daily norms.



(May,Buraidah-KSA)Two universes mosey down the street
Connected by love and a leash and nothing else.
Mostly I look at lamplight through the leaves
While he mooches along with tail up and snout down,
Getting a secret knowledge through the nose
Almost entirely hidden from my sight.

We stand while he's enraptured by a bush
Till I can't stand our standing any more
And haul him off; for our relationship
Is patience balancing to this side tug
And that side drag; a pair of symbionts
Contented not to think each other's thoughts.

What else we have in common's what he taught,
Our interest in shit. We know its every state
From steaming fresh through stink to nature's way
Of sluicing it downstreet dissolved in rain
Or drying it to dust that blows away.
We move along the street inspecting shit.

His sense of it is keener far than mine,
And only when he finds the place precise
He signifies by sniffing urgently
And circles thrice about, and squats, and shits,
Whereon we both with dignity walk home
And just to show who's master I write the poem. 

Out of the unbounded, and into a pair of Converse shoes! 
Morning meditation over, I come downstairs, 
Approaching Lucky in the gray light, leash in hand.
He spins crazy circles at the end of his chain, 
I raise a stick to make him crouch- it's just a game,  
The quick way to fasten the leash and start walking; 
Then he lunges like a bloodhound hot on the trail, 
He leans against my drag like a sled dog.
He treats me like I'm just a dead log, 
He wheezes from pulling me so hard, 
Poor Lucky, you are not enjoying your walk.
Tugging at cross purposes won't get us to the park.
You are a bundle of nerves! 
Your collie-shepherd features could be regal
But they lose their handsomeness
When you hunch your head and shoulders
To pull in a direction we are headed anyway.
Get a clue, you packet of excess muscle.
The way you strain against resistance
Evaporates your energy into the void; 
You turn the spigot of vitality wide open; 
How much will be given to you in this life? 
You've got to learn to subtilize your kundalini; 
You've got to turn your drives into a snake dance.
Being a Temple dog, you are called upon to learn this.
Just now I was having my morning sit, just sitting; 
The whole universe was taking me for a walk.
I did not yank and pull;  I wanted to see where I could go.
You and I could be cruising along, smelling all kinds of bushes.
We could be parading our smooth gait on other blocks.

It's time to teach Lucky not to pull.
I don't use a torture collar that tightens and chokes.
I don't follow a police-dog training program.
Whenever Lucky yanks I simply yank back.
Here we go.  Stop hunching like you're ready to pull: 
Take that.  Don't forget I'll respond to you.
Take that.  That's how my shoulder feels when you pull.
Don't pull.  Take that.  YELP! 
I look sheepishly around for Animal Liberation.
Each time I yank, I should yank as an enlightened mentor, 
But my temper insists on giving lessons to Lucky.
My temper takes us both for a walk, yanking and yanking, 
While Prokofiev in my headphones stirs up the drama.

Lucky is a smart dog:  after four days he gets the idea.
He's careful not to pull, but he makes tight turns
He burns off his excitement by doing figure-eights, 
Runs loops as I change the leash from hand to hand.
We have the routine down. Based on the ratio of pi, 
I figure he covers three times the distance I walk

He settles to a prancing trot, with head held high. 
He stops to sniff and lift his leg, my mind records it all: 
Too many useless details about which shrubs he likes.
At the privet bushes, he trickles scent over waxy leaves; 
And a row of yew trees is Lucky's spot to move his bowels: 
He backs his rump among the limber branches, 
Likes to dump his load on the forked branch of a shrub, 
Mostly it's a classic hunker, back paws in front of front paws, 
Then he stands up and scuffs grains of dirt behind him.
He likes slinking and groveling among knik-knik creepers.
He scuffs and scatters the mulch of cedar chips.
Sometimes he walks straight past the creeper growth; 
Sometimes he cannot get enough of groveling in it.
One morning he stood like a bear, leaning against a wall, 
Because a blackbird was chirping in a lemon tree. 
Lucky likes to rub against the base of juniper trees; 
He grovels sideways and winds himself around a shrub, 
Then rolls himself wet in the dewy grass beside it.
He buries head and shoulders in the stiff branches.
This is his game of hiding in the underbrush, 
His chance to forget the chain that holds him captive.
His herd-dog blood makes him a native of open fields, 
But getting lost in thickets in his atavistic fantasy.
Lucky dreams of immersion among his own kind.
At trees visited by dogs, he lingers to imprint their scent, 
He likes to rub his head against fresh droppings: 
Getting some on his fur lets him 'study' the scent closely.
He knows the scent of dogs who walk in our neighborhood.
Breathing in scent is the closest he gets to running with them.   

Walking Lucky at daybreak requires a wary eye.
A certain lady is out walking six large dogs at once; 
Lucky turns rigid when he spots them on the next block; 
I turn in the other direction, not trusting Lucky to keep cool.
The lady gives a distant nod, to say I did the right thing.   
I also avoid the half-Rottweiler that runs circles in its yard, 
And the German shepherd that is in constant frenzy.
One morning Lucky slipped from the leash and dashed off; 
I followed, but he streaked away when I drew near; 
He ran out of sight, but I could hear him barking.
I arrived in time to see him back away from a fight, 
In the excitement, Lucky forgot that he was running away, 
He emerged from the yard and ran straight to greet me.

Sometimes walking Lucky cheers me out of a low mood.
In the hot afternoon, I call him from his plastic-igloo doghouse; 
Or he crawls from under a freesia bush with pollen on his muzzle
On the lawn near the shopping center, he attacks sprinklers for a game; 
He shakes his head rapidly and bites at the jet of water; 
He comes close to the nozzle, but shakes himself and runs away.
He did succeed in tearing out one sprinkler head: 
He was tied up beside it, so it was serious business.

By gray light I slip downstairs in the morning, 
The atmosphere quivers with glissades of violin.
I scan for a nervous edge, want to hear the city's mood; 
When 'Classical  starts a stodgy old-time theme, 
I switch to 'Power  Where Hip-Hop Lives.'
Lucky leaps up to meet me, upending his empty bowl: 
It is only a dusty dented bowl of tin; 
Under my breath I say, 'This is Mambrino's helmet.'[
With these words, I observe my entry to the antic realm, 
Where anything could be the wreckage of a dream.
Lucky is my animal familiar, conducting me
To moments of primal life, away from human-centeredness.
Lucky is my totem animal, now altered by nearness to Man, 
Who leads me back around to the Nature I live within. 
I run with my lodge brother, casting my eyes about 
For things to gather up and keep close inside, 
As gifts for the lodge partners I hope to run beside.




September

Powerlines along my path bristled
with electric fire, scorching
the raised brow of September'

Just past a green patch of sumac, 
I found my neighbor Terence, waiting, 
letting his dog wander the meadow.

We spent a few minutes
bent over thew meadow flowers
looking for the bergamot plant.

He straightened first.
'We can't see it, but we know 
it's here. Even the dog smells it.'

'Yes, ' I said, still searching.
'Smelling it is reward enough, '
and I realized it was time to part.

I ambled east, further into
the treeless meadow. His gold dog
led him west toward a grove of aspen.

No doubt he too walked as slowly
as this summer was becoming autumn.
The scarecrows were all fast asleep.

A lone hawk glided far above
the birds of passage. I imagined
an evening drinking Earl Grey tea, 

and writing again those long letters
I once called 'massive missives'
before sleeping as deeply as the scarecrows.


October

Small groups of Canadian geese, 
five of them, crossed the cloudy sky.
Their honking raised my eyes
from earth to heaven, and I stopped
raking to watch them disappear
into thick clouds, no longer winged things
but just dots, like crooked ellipses, 
sinking into the depths of heavy paper, 
whatever message they were spelling
by their flight, smudged, then erased, 
lost in whiteness.


November

The bronze path through the woods
crunches under our shoes. Hard earth 
holds steady. The delicate higher branches
of a leaning aspen map another way out.
The air, sliced by flights of bees, 
bleeds summer warmth over this November day.

Ages ago, you stopped counting our steps.
We walk. side by side, in an 'andante' rhythm, 
as if we have nothing else to hope for.
The smoky scents of autumn cannot be denied.
We breathe them as we climb a steep slope
of leafless trees. Breathless at the top, 

we keep moving, as certain of reaching 
our true home as the geese winging overhead.



The sunroom is without light. You slouch
in a big chair, wrapped in a dark blue blanket.
Your brown eyes are the brightest spots
to be seen, and the many-colored glow
of the television provides the only window
into the outside world. It is the middle
of the evening. 

Scraps of paper litter the floor. A few pages
float about, refusing to land, unwilling
to lie forgotten. In my library, a single bulb
illuminates a volume of Goethe. I am turning
the pages slowly, and it is enough. Pelleas
is already asleep, his head tucked loosely
under his cowl. Just beyond this white wall

in front of me, clouds fold into each other, 
and a deluge of snow is poised to fall all winter long. 


Anyone with quiet pace who 
walks a gray road in the West 
may hear a badger underground where 
in deep flint another time is 


Caught by flint and held forever, 
Anyone who listens walks on 
time that dogs him single file, 


To mountains that are far from people, 
the face of the land gone gray like flint. 
Badgers dig their little lives there, 
quiet-paced the land lies gaunt, 


The railroad dies by a yellow depot, 
town falls away toward a muddy creek. 
Badger-gray the sod goes under 
a river of wind, a hawk on a stick. 

With heav'n, my journeys'-end, in view;
Supported by his staff and rod,
My road is safe and pleasant too, 

I travel through a desert wide
Where many round me blindly stray;
But He vouchsafes to be my guide,
And will not let me miss my way. 

Though snares and dangers throng my path,
And earth and hell my course withstand;
I triumph over all by faith,
Guarded by his Almighty hand. 

The wilderness affords no food,
Provides me every needful good,
And frees my soul from wants and cares. 

With him sweet converse I maintain,
Great as he is I dare be free;
I tell him all my grief and pain,
And he reveals his love to me. 

Some cordial from his word he brings,
Whene'er my feeble spirit faints;
At once my soul revives and sings,
And yields no more to sad complaints. 

I pity all that worldlings talk
Of pleasures that will quickly end;
With thee, my Guide, my Guard, my Friend. 


Somewhere, sometime, you were Wounded
Maybe as early as infancy when you were denied
All the essentials of the bonding experience
Perhaps the wounds were inflicted 
When another toddler refused to return the toy you readily shared
Or by the mean girl who broke your favorite colored crayon
Or the bully who pushed you on the playground
Or perhaps it happened that first time
Someone more sophisticated, though lacking empathy,  
Assailed your ears with a course laughter, 
Aimed at you like a lethal weapon
Contrasting the cheerful chorus of joy laughter had always been
Maybe it happened the day you ran home crying
Mother revealed a secret: "Not everyone you meet will like you"
Unwelcome words that wounded and wound their way 
Like strangling ivy around your core 
Taking root in your heart of hearts
Passing years provide a scale of scar
Yet you are Wounded still

Somewhere, sometime, your Innocence was lost
Maybe it happened when your missing bicycle 
Was spotted in the driveway on the next block
Or the day that special pebble found on the playground
Mysteriously vanished from your backpack
Maybe it was the first time you witnessed another’s tears 
And yet perceived no evidence of physical injury
Perhaps it was the initial instance when you caught someone in a lie
Betrayal became a biting sting instead of just a word
Maybe it was on the day the friendly neighbor invited you in for a visit
Closed the door, pulled down the shades
And the most sacred shelter of innocence was shattered
At the unworthy hands of one of life’s lowest thieves
You learned another bitter truth
The knowledge of good and evil force-fed like bitter fruit
Time having done all it can to repair or bury
Yet Innocence is lost still

Whatever time, whatever place, or in whatever manner
Those who contributed to your loss of Innocence
Or at whose hands you were first Wounded
Do not hold the power to heal you 
And they never will.
Even should they acknowledge and repent
You would still be walking through life wounded
Your initial Innocence still lost
Only you can sooth the hurts, 
Bind the wounds, reclaim your rightful share of Innocence


Only Your Indomitable Spirit Can Prevail

Yours the choice to reject surrender and to overcome 
You, accepting the role of Hero of your own life, 
Who, in casting off from the past, 
Becomes the Captain of all future voyages
Becoming one with the rest of us 
We, the "Walking Wounded"


The saddle was hung on the stockyard rail,
And the poor old horse stood whisking his tail,
For there never was seen such a regular screw
As Wallabi Joe, of Bunnagaroo;
Whilst the shearers all said, as they say, of course,
That Wallabi Joe's a fine lump of a horse;
But the stockmen said, as they laughed aside,
He'd barely do for a Sunday's ride.


O—oh! poor Wallabi Joe.
"I'm weary of galloping now," he cried,
"I wish I were killed for my hide, my hide;
For my eyes are dim, and my back is sore,
And I feel that my legs won't stand much more


Now stockman Bill, who took care of his nag,
Put under the saddle a soojee bag,
And off he rode with a whip in his hand
To look for a mob of the R. 



Now stockman Bill camped out that night,
And he hobbled his horse in a sheltered bight;
Next day of old Joe he found not a track,
So he had to trudge home with his swag on his back.
He searched up and down every gully he knew,
But he found not a hair of his poor old screw,
And the stockmen all said as they laughed at his woe,
"Would you sell us the chance of old Wallabi Joe


Now as years sped by, and as Bill grew old,
It came into his head to go poking for gold;
So away he went with a spade in his fist,
To hunt for a nugget among the schist.
One day as a gully he chanced to cross,
He came on the bones of his poor old horse;
The hobbles being jammed in a root below
Had occasioned the death of poor Wallabi Joe. 


He would leave early and walk slowly
      As if balancing books           
On the way to school, already expecting 
To be tardy once again and heavy      
With numbers, the unfashionably rounded           
Toes of his shoes invisible beyond 
The slope of his corporation. He would pause      
At his favorite fundamentally sound           
Park bench, which had been the birthplace 
Of paeans and ruminations on other mornings,    
  And would turn his back to it, having gauged the distance  
 Between his knees and the edge of the hardwood 
Almost invariably unoccupied     
 At this enlightened hour by the bums of nighttime          
 (For whom the owlish eye of the moon
 Had been closed by daylight) , and would give himself wholly over      
Backwards and trustingly downwards          
 And be well seated there. He would remove
 From his sinister jacket pocket a postcard     
 And touch it and retouch it with the point         
  Of the fountain he produced at his fingertips
 And fill it with his never-before-uttered    
  Runes and obbligatos and pellucidly cryptic         
  Duets from private pageants, from broken ends 
Of fandangos with the amoeba chaos chaos      
Couchant and rampant. Then he would rise        
   With an effort as heartfelt as a decision
 To get out of bed on Sunday and carefully   
   Relocate his center of gravity      
     Above and beyond an imaginary axis
 Between his feet and carry the good news
      Along the path and the sidewalk, well on his way  
         To readjusting the business of the earth. 


If you could know how much I make, 
I'm sure to see you blush! 
To reap the stipend that I do
Will mean, therefore, I look at you
From high above in my success

The greedy bastard that I am -
I love to drown in bling; 
Unlike you – so bloody poor, and
Picking coins up off the floor! 
But sorry mate, I'm not to blame –
The fact your bank account is lame! 

Come and see my flashy car 
Awash inside with leather; 
I saw the battered wreck you drive, 
Spewing out its oily smog! 
Your banger, friend, is such a dog, 
Clanking out its dialogue.

I shall die in gleaming wealth, 
Floating out in gentle stealth –
Having bought a glowing health.
As for you, my hard-up mate, 
You'll fade away a slave to fate, 
Surviving on the welfare state.  





Greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed, greed, feed the greed. 




I am in the Wallowing-
there I find my best and worse.

Pity-Wallow is where I focus
all on my self and go inward
for long moments of pity-filled indulgence of self.

Sorrow-Wallow allows me to grieve
on my own terms, yet not really suffer
too much.
 
Wallow-Defeats are my best
and where I re-learn over and over again
not to regret.

Good Wallow where I learn lessons
over and over again-
Down is the best way Up; 
Out is the best way Back: 
 
Wallow-Defeat is the path to Happiness-
if you Wallow quietly and accept
that a Good Wallow is where you
plan for the Wallow-Through
not stop and rest amid your Wallowings.

As my Mother used to say: 

'Cry and Wallow that's ok
but use the time to plan to get
back on your feet again.'
 A good Wallow is a terrible thing to waste.

'Growing up
as a shy & quiet person
I've always wanted
to live in tranquility
so, I picked my spot
in the corner of a little city
where everyone lived isolated lives
cocooned behind four walls! 

It was a quiet & lonely place
but, despite the solitude
I, nevertheless felt secure
behind all the concrete
neither did I feel the need
to know personally the person
who lived on the other side! 

I had built myself a fortress
that kept me protected
from the outside world
and the only interaction
I had with it
was an occasional: 
'hellos and goodbyes'
and ironically I claimed
to know everyone quasi-perfectly! 

It's not that I hated people
It's just that I was scared of them
but, one can only live this way
for a little while
because, sooner or later
even a cocooned caterpillar
must come out of it's cocoon
and likewise, a man can't hide forever
BECAUSE, NO MAN IS AN ISLAND

their foreheads, by my love
I earn them. in their presence
I am wretched as death. They smile
to me of love. They cheer me
and I smile. These are stones
in the catapulting world; 
they fly, bury themselves in flesh,
in a wall, in earth; in midair
break against each other
and are without sound.
I sent them catapulting.
They outflew my voice
towards vacant spaces,
but I have called them farther,
to the stillness beyond,
to death which I have praised. 


some dream 
on the deck you've fallen 
cold and dead

with mournful tread 
I walk the deck 
my Captain lies

the steady keel
the vessel grim and daring
the bleeding drops of red

for you bouquets and 
ribboned wreaths
the shores a-crowding

the port is near
the bells I hear
the people all exulting

from fearful trip
the victor ship
comes in



A foot and light-hearted I take to the open road, 
Healthy, free, the world before me, 
The long brown path before meleading me wherever I choose.
I ask not good fortune, I myself am good fortune.
                                         Walt Whitman

Yes, me, American to the core, Poet of the Open Road! 
That means a life of walking, hiking, trudging, 
trekking, sauntering, oh, and loafing from time to time.
But in your time people race in vehicles, 
no time left topursue the life of the roads.
They are always disappearing behind you. My favorite
roads wind along the wavy path parallel to a great river.
No short cuts, no straight lines. It keeps
you nimble and and alert, both body and soul engaged.

Roads are curious characters, like you and me.
They want to know everything about the world
they occupy, so they twist and bend, circle and
spiral, imprinting by movement itself
their landscapes in memories. They rejoice
in the upward climb and the downward rush. 
We poets take time to walk. There is no 
destination more important than each curve, 
eachbump of the road itself. The roads know 
thngs only perpetual journeyers learn.

What visions, what new selves
will be realized by the journey! 
We must carry both flesh and spirit
across land and water and air
toward whatever destination for us
is marked on the inner map of our existence.
And that dark spirit, that soul
that propels us from within, must be
matched by a free mind, eating the light, 
and plotting a direct path through daylight
and night. Such is the double vision of our being.

The roads delight in hugging the edges
of meadows and smelling the scents of
teeming wildflowers. They slow down
and rest in the shade of flourishing
great trees. But inevitably the heights
summon them. When they arrive on the highest 
platau, they circle around and around, 
making shifting patterns in the ground
that later journeyers will see as hieratic, 
and invest with solemn meanings. 

You and I
are among those later journeyers, and we
nudge our lives forward by ascent and descent.

Again visions will flood our consciousnes, 
and new selves will assume new roles
they will play with serious levity or
laughing intensity. Still many carry home
only their old selves, and complain about 
the weight they fear to disgard. But we
let the the air dissolve our old selves
and delight in our new, supple, spacious 
selves. Oh, does not space become time
in these heights? Do we not lavish our eyes
with brightening vistas, even as we stand, 
rapt and silent, occupying a moment endlessly
extended, as if it were a road forever open
to eternity.  

What will I say in departing? Perhaps it should be
a gesture: a shrug of my shoulders, a waving of both
hands, like a crazy fellow, a deep bow, as if I were
again playing the fool? But, no, it must be a farewell
of words, because we are poets, and the words we speak
and write we have borrowed from past eons and future eons
will borrow them from us. The words, the words, Fabrizio! 
Spill them, toss them, give them as gifts to children, 
lend them to the tongue-tied lover, teach the angry man
to use them instead of his fists, help the lonely connect 
with them. 



Upon the work of Walter Landor
I am unfit to write with candor.
If you can read it, well and good;
But as for me, I never could. 

I touch hatred like a covered breast;
I without stopping go from garment to garment,
sleeping at a distance.

I am not, I'm of no use, I do not know
anyone; I have no weapons of ocean or wood,
I do not live in this house.

My mouth is full of night and water.
The abiding moon determines
what I do not have.

What I have is in the midst of the waves,
a ray of water, a day for myself,
an iron depth.

There is no cross-tide, there is no shield, no costume,
there is no special solution too deep to be sounded,
no vicious eyelid.

I live suddenly and other times I follow.
I touch a face suddenly and it murders me.
I have no time.

Do not look for me when drawing
the usual wild thread or the
bleeding net.

Do not call me: that is my occupation.
Do not ask my name or my condition.
Leave me in the middle of my own moon
in my wounded ground. 


Surround'd by lunacy
Enclos'd in madness
I reach for help
But no one is there
Higher power hath forfeit
To the disobeys of man
Leaked sorrows
All ‘pon this land
Thou have fled this realm
Left an irate man in charge
Our voice absent
Inaudible to the scream
Of the cry of Mother's pain
We now must stand
And grab our Mother's hand
And waltz thro' this underworld
That has been created by our leaders
Politics and Governments
Wars plague the Earth
An epidemic in most hearts
All this tyranny
Will tear the world
In a quarter of a half
We must now play all piano
All violin and trumpet
And waltz this insanity out
Dance away the lies
Dance away the conspiracies
Oust all the battles
And waltz with a jocund company
Wear happiness on your face
Dispel all sadness
On e'ery nation
Dance felicity about
Waltz thy joy all o'er the land
But most of all importance
Waltz together as a united man. 



OH! there once was a swagman camped in the Billabong, 
   Under the shade of a Coolabah tree; 
And he sang as he looked at his old billy boiling, 
   "Who’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me." 

Who’ll come a-waltzing Matilda, my darling, 
    Who’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me? 
Waltzing Matilda and leading a water-bag— 
    Who’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me? 
Down came a jumbuck to drink at the water-hole, 
   Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him in glee; 
And he sang as he put him away in his tucker-bag, 
   "You’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me!" 

Down came the Squatter a-riding his thorough-bred; 
   Down came Policemen—one, two, and three. 
"Whose is the jumbuck you’ve got in the tucker-bag? 
   You’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me." 

But the swagman, he up and he jumped in the water-hole, 
   Drowning himself by the Coolabah tree; 
And his ghost may be heard as it sings in the Billabong, 
   "Who’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?" 




The thread in the hand of a kind mother
Is the coat on the wanderer's back.
Before he left she stitched it close
In secret fear that he would be slow to return.
Who will say that the inch of grass in his heart
Is gratitude enough for all the sunshine of spring?
Yarns after yarns, 
Mother's busy weaving,
It is a coat for my son who will be leaving.
Stitches upon stitches,
Mother toiled all night,
Please return home soon if you might.
Your graceful love was sunshine in the spring
for me, this unworthy seedling,
Oh, who can tell me how to express my gratitude,
my aching heart is bleeding. 

I seem to have lost my lamp
during the night of wandering breaths.

I didn't know where I was when I woke-up, 
I started arguing with the trees and the Rocks
and with myself. And then I cried! 

Then in the distant mists I heard a voice telling me, 
'No matter what happens, keep going..
for you are sure to find yourself someday'! 

Hence here I am, searching very myself, 
I once really was, never for my own behalf. 

Wandering Justice
O! Dear, have I hit a miss? 
With wandering justice

When society systems fail
And someone goes to jail
Without any chance of bail
Or ever setting out again on sea to sail
For something they did not do; it is a sad tale

When there is war instead of peace
And dignified people are looking for ass to kiss
Where is justice? 

Countries are suffering in health and poverty
Whilst others are enjoying wealth and property
Where is justice? 

O! Dear, have I hit a miss? 
With wandering justice

When someone you love
Is taken away to the skies above
Where is the justice? 

When you read endlessly to take exams
Another passes it with some fraudulent scam
Where is the justice? 

When all your life you work so hard
Doesn’t it get you viciously mad? 
When the jackpot hits another who is bad
Where is the justice? 

When life takes away your child
Because you ignored health symptoms as mild
Where is the justice? 

At work when your original innovations
Reward your boss with a standing ovation
Followed by a double or triple promotion
And all you get from the boss is a caution
Where is the justice? 

When living a healthy life is nothing but a trick
As destiny picks on you for the sake of a kick
With illnesses for the unhealthy and the weak 
All the same you are the one who ends up sick
Where is the justice? 

O! Dear, have I hit a miss? 
With wandering justice
Fair for all is what I call justice
Moments of rewarding bliss

When a man plants his seeds
Creating numerous mouths to feed
And he provides them with all their needs
I call it Justice! 

When you work hard
Indulging in good not bad
And life rewards make you so glad
I call it Justice! 

Yet justice often wanders away
Before you have your chance of say
When it wanders, the price is often high to pay

O! Dear, have I hit a miss? 
With wandering justice
As it leaves behind a trail of flaws
That is not within the confinement of fair law

A Fantasy for Cigeng

Let me pour you a cup of tea
flavored with peach. I call this tea
TRANQUILITY. How could it be otherwise
on the occasion of our first meeting? 
You in the flush of youth and myself
in a vigorous old age, kept alive by 
Taoist magic and my own stubborn disregard
for anything that does not promote
the happiness of life. And so it is I am 
visiting you, Cigeng, on this autumn night, 
and it seems to both of us to be a moment
of perfection. How could it be otherwise, 
when two poets, separated by mountains of time, 
find themselves in a valley of mutual presence. 
Which of us has performed this Taoist magic? 
Oh, how we will revel in this memory! I will
tell my friends, I have seen the future of China
in a young woman's face that radiated 
the beauty of her deepest self. You will tell
your friends of an ancestor's resolve 
to face the sun every morning with promises
and to face the moon every night with their fulfillment.
And thus we will share the benefits of our meeting
with everyone else. The tea is still warm and sweet. 

I lived in perilous times. You know this 
from the poems of my peers, Du Fu and Li Bai. 
But you also know the whole of history, 
spread out like a map of human lives for a thousand years, 
my own life just a blink of that immensity. My heart
is troubled by what I have seen of your world.
I could always withdraw to the solitude of the mountains
and nature would sweetly restore me. But for you
I fear there is no such withdrawal, and nature is 
overwhelmed in your progress. You must cultivate 
a courage equal to the needs of your Destiny! 

Still, I want you to remember our meeting as 
an occasion of laughter, not tears; as a time
of bright tranquility, like the tea we drank; 
an event in time which enhances eternity.
I want this meeting to be your Peach Blossom Spring
that will never be lost or abandoned, never decline
into winter, never dissolve into unreality. I want
it to flourish in your deepest self. I want you
to say to your friends, The spirit of Wang Wei
has lifted our spirits for a thousand years, 
and he will joyfully pursue this mission
for another thousand years. How could it be otherwise? 
His love for us is the Wheel-Rim River that flows
through our lives and forever refreshes us
with its goodness and longevity. 



How could it be otherwise! 'wanksta

a one-line poem in itself; 
a sociological truffle
to be sniffed, snorted and snaffled
by academic hogstas; 

a British schoolboy taunt
for a sad loser
with more than a hint of
adolescent sexual guilt
and strengthened by the shouts
of football terraces

now fierce with
the combative
minority-to-majority
two fingers to Culture
black ethos of the deprived
asserting its claim, 
rappin ' on the door, yea, rappin' on the door
of that same Kulcha

yet mediated by the assertive
individual competition
of those same cultural fighters
taunting each other, 
schoolboys with loaded guns

wanksta, wanksta, 
yo ain't no gangsta

a word that's all front
and no back

but as a poet
I enjoy it

I wanna be your zither, 
play fingers on string.
Music and tempest, 
whichever it may bring.
I will bear with patience, 
your every given stroke, 
you will give upon me.
Let me forgive who broke, 
the strings of my heart! 
I wanna sit at your feet, 
to tell the saga of suffering
race and the aching beat! 
Play me with your tranquility, 
with your calm and quiet mind! 
Oh Nature! walk and sing with me, 
Do not leave me far behind

To know you, 
to throw you, 
to take you, 
out of mind.
I wanna learn 
your diction, 
thus wanna bind, 
your soul with 
mine and my
spirit with thine.
Wanna learn your 
every word, 
wanna reach
me in your height.
If the world 
send me back, 
I'll fight the very fight. 

THE TRUTH IS; ; ; 
everyone is going to HURT you.
YOU just have to decide. 
WHO IS WORTH THE PAIN. ♥i want him, i cant have him and its killing me.

i see him everyday with that lopsided grin on his face and it makes me want to throw my arms around him a kiss him, but i cant.  
when he looks at me, its like he can stare into my soul, and he doesnt even know it, i wish i could tell him how i feel, but im afraid of getting hurt again, i wish i could be stronger.
i want to hold him again, a hug after school is as close as it gets for me now, they started short, but now they linger, but never as long as i would like. 

the hard truth is that i still love him, everyone can see it except him, and i wish i could change that eep inside i cry
far outside i hide.

showing no pain, i die.
not wanting to show i cried.

wanting to reveal, 
to somthing no one beleived was real.
hoping to find a heal, 
to somthing you could not feel.

wishing to live, 
im willing to give. 

Sometimes what you need isn't what you want
Sometimes what you want isn't what you need
Sometimes you don't know what you need
So you go for what you want
And some other times you get what you need even when it isn't what you want
And since what you got isn't what you wanted 
You'll not pay enough attention to it
And you'll mistreat it
And eventually you will lose it
And this is when you realise that what you need
Is actually what you really want
But then it would be too late to get it back
Because what gets hurt gets lost
And most of the times isn't easily found, if found at all
The point is 
Always cherish what you have
You never know when you might lose it
Even if what you have isn't what you want
Live with it
Stick to it
Believe in it
Take care of it
Don't break it
Don't ruin it for yourself
Don't ruin it for others
Someday you'll understand what I mean
But till then
Promise that you'll never disregard anything
No matter how small
Or silly or useless
it may seem


Ambition, power, and avarice, now have hurled
Death, fate, and ruin, on a bleeding world.
See! on yon heath what countless victims lie,
Hark! what loud shrieks ascend through yonder sky;
Tell then the cause, 'tis sure the avenger's rage 
Has swept these myriads from life's crowded stage:
Hark to that groan, an anguished hero dies,
He shudders in death’s latest agonies;
Yet does a fleeting hectic flush his cheek,
Yet does his parting breath essay to speak--
For whose support this fainting frame lies low;
For whose support in distant lands I bleed,
Let his friends' welfare be the warrior's meed.
He hears me not—ah! no—kings cannot hear, 
For passion's voice has dulled their listless ear.
Thou wilt not scorn a suppliant's anguished groan.
Oh! now I die--but still is death's fierce pain--
He spake, reclined him on death's bloody bed,
And with a parting groan his spirit fled.
Oppressors of mankind to YOU we owe
The baleful streams from whence these miseries flow;
For you how many a mother weeps her son, 
Snatched from life's course ere half his race was run!
For you how many a widow drops a tear,
In silent anguish, on her husband's bier!
'Is it then Thine, Almighty Power,' she cries,
'Whence tears of endless sorrow dim these eyes?
Is this the system which Thy powerful sway,
Which else in shapeless chaos sleeping lay,
Formed and approved?--it cannot be--but oh!
Forgive me, Heaven, my brain is warped by woe.'
'Tis not--He never bade the war-note swell, 
He never triumphed in the work of hell--
Monarchs of earth! thine is the baleful deed,
Thine are the crimes for which thy subjects bleed.
Ah! when will come the sacred fated time,
When man unsullied by his leaders' crime,
Despising wealth, ambition, pomp, and pride,
Will stretch him fearless by his foe-men's side?
Ah! when will come the time, when o'er the plain
No more shall death and desolation reign?
When will the sun smile on the bloodless field, 
And the stern warrior's arm the sickle wield?
Not whilst some King, in cold ambition's dreams,
Plans for the field of death his plodding schemes;
Not whilst for private pique the public fall,
And one frail mortal's mandate governs all. 
Swelled with command and mad with dizzying sway;
Who sees unmoved his myriads fade away.
Careless who lives or dies--so that he gains
Some trivial point for which he took the pains.
What then are Kings?--I see the trembling crowd, 
I hear their fulsome clamours echoed loud;
Their stern oppressor pleased appears awhile,
But April's sunshine is a Monarch’s smile--
Kings are but dust--the last eventful day
Will level all and make them lose their sway; 
Will dash the sceptre from the Monarch’s hand,
And from the warrior’s grasp wrest the ensanguined brand.
Oh! Peace, soft Peace, art thou for ever gone,
Is thy fair form indeed for ever flown?
And love and concord hast thou swept away, 
As if incongruous with thy parted sway?
Alas, I fear thou hast, for none appear.
Now o'er the palsied earth stalks giant Fear,
With War, and Woe, and Terror, in his train;--
List'ning he pauses on the embattled plain,
Then speeding swiftly o'er the ensanguined heath,
Has left the frightful work to Hell and Death.
See! gory Ruin yokes his blood-stained car,
He scents the battle's carnage from afar;
Hell and Destruction mark his mad career, 
He tracks the rapid step of hurrying Fear;
Whilst ruined towns and smoking cities tell,
That thy work, Monarch, is the work of Hell.
'It is thy work!' I hear a voice repeat,
Shakes the broad basis of thy bloodstained seat; 
And at the orphan’s sigh, the widow's moan,
Totters the fabric of thy guilt-stained throne--
'It is thy work, O Monarch;' now the sound
Fainter and fainter, yet is borne around,
Yet to enthusiast ears the murmurs tell
That Heaven, indignant at the work of Hell,
Will soon the cause, the hated cause remove,
Which tears from earth peace, innocence, and love. 

The violent wars 
Is all about selfishness
Brace yourself in war


One night a feat was held in the palace, and there came a man and
prostrated himself before the prince, and all the feasters looked
upon him; and they saw that one of his eyes was out and that
the empty socket bled. And the prince inquired of him, 'What has
befallen you?' And the man replied, 'O prince, I am by profession
a thief, and this night, because there was no moon, I went to rob
the money-changer's shop, and as I climbed in through the window
I made a mistake and entered the weaver's shop, and in the dark I
ran into the weaver's loom and my eye was plucked out. And now,
O prince, I ask for justice upon the weaver.'

Then the prince sent for the weaver and he came, and it was decreed
that one of his eyes should be plucked out.

'O prince,' said the weaver, 'the decree is just. It is right that
one of my eyes be taken. And yet, alas! both are necessary to me
in order that I may see the two sides of the cloth that I weave.
But I have a neighbour, a cobbler, who has also two eyes, and in
his trade both eyes are not necessary.'

Then the prince sent for the cobbler. And he came. And they took
out one of the cobbler's two eyes.

And justice was satisfied

"This war is a terrible thing," he said, 
"With its countless numbers of needless dead; 
A futile warfare it seems to me, 
Fought for no principle I can see. 
Alas, that thousands of hearts should bleed 
For naught but a tyrant's boundless greed!" 

* * * *

Said the wholesale grocer, in righteous mood, 
As he went to adulterate salable food.

Spake as follows the merchant king: 
"Isn't this war a disgusting thing? 
Heartless, cruel, and useless, too; 
It doesn't seem that it can be true. 
Think of the misery, want and fear! 
We ought to be grateful we've no war here.

* * * *

"Six a week"--to a girl--"That's flat! 
I can get a thousand to work for that

"We do not want blood bath and war, 
We are faithful to love, peace and care.
By no means use the tools of death, 
Nor farms plough the crop of wrath.


Do not want to write the tale of disaster and flames, 
Written by the canons of gallant and unyielding soldiers, 
Cultivate the sacred song, love mounting, 
With all the stairs of blissful rhyming.  

We will wrestle for a planet sans war, 
Ring out the disgrace and distress of tar, 
Those who crop of weapon of destruction, 
Will hymn for serenity, bury shells and deception. 

Those trade shrouds must spread adore, 
The old bare dreams, would spring love and care, 
Eliminate starvation and sickness, all devils' possession. 

Wait yet, my friends, a second stays— 
Stay our fertile green land turn red rays, 
We are all ex brothers and sisters, 
Live till the good land lives without battles.

'There is in this world that eternal battle'
the General said
'between Good and Evil.

There can be no compromise; 
each nation needs living space
and those who follow Evil
will not hesitate
to take yours
and that means, 
some of the time, 
War.

War is the ultimate expression 
of Evil vs. Good
and inevitable.'


Peace spoke: 
War is for those who profit from War
and every war ends in Peace
and diplomacy, 
Why not skip the destruction and killing
save human lives
and go straight to the Peace? 

Nation-State spoke: 
Ah, you Peace forget War
is more than the interval between
the Peace
because War decides which people
will be free
and which people will be oppressed.
Peace you misunderstand; 
soldiers fight to preserve their country-mens' lifestyles
their families
and those five dollar lattes.


Ah, indeed in War and Peace
someone wins
and someone loses' Nation-State said.

Peace spoke: 
Well, Nation-State, that used to be true
but not anymore.
Nuclear holocaust has no winners, 
only losers.

A radioactive planet 
where no one can live
for a thousand years
is not victory 
but massive defeat for everyone.
.
Nothing to celebrate.

You '
Peace said
to the General
'cannot fulfill your main mission
which is to protect the population.
The foe you fight can blow up
all of their nuclear weapons
and the fall out will drift and kill
the rest of us 
without even an attack.

You soldiers have to learn new tricks.
You can't really protect us.

All that is gone. You have to retire that side-gun
and sit at the diplomat's table.

'Peace 'Peace said'
has come to depend upon successful social ecology
and restraining those who would have us kill ourselves
in order to preserve our lives. 

War is Peace
Peace is War

War unites against
One common enemy
Peace tears apart
A dream-like society

The fear during War
Gives control to the government
The calmness of Peace
Lets your guard down with sentiment

War causes death
Physically, Statistically

Peace ends life
Emotionally, Personally

War is Peace
Peace is War


THOU, bright Futurity! whose prospect beams,
In dawning radiance on our day-light dreams;
Whose lambent meteors and ethereal forms
Gild the dark clouds, and glitter thro' the storms;
On thy broad canvas fancy loves to trace,
Her brilliant Iris, drest in vivid grace;
Paints fair creations in celestial dyes,
Tints of the morn and blushes of the skies;
And bids her scenes perfection's robe assume,
The mingling flush of light, and life, and bloom.
Thou bright Futurity! whose morning-star
Still beams unveil'd, unclouded, from afar;
Whose lovely vista smiling Hope surveys,
Thro' the dim twilight of the silvery haze;

Oh! let the muse expand her wing on high,
Thy shadowy realms, thy worlds unknown descry;
Let her clear eye-beam, flashing lucid light,
Chase from thy forms th' involving shades of night;
Pierce the dark clouds that veil thy noontide rays,
And soar, exulting, in meridian blaze!
In bliss, in grief, thy radiant scenes bestow,
The zest of rapture, or the balm of woe!
For, as the sun-flower to her idol turns,
Glows in his noon, and kindles as he burns;
Expands her bosom to th' exalting fire,
Lives but to gaze, and gazes to admire;
E'en so to thee, the mind incessant flies,
From thy pure source the fount of joy supplies;
And steals from thee the sunny light that throws
A brighter blush on pleasure's living rose!
To thee pale sorrow turns her eye of tears,
Lifts the dim curtain of unmeasur'd years;
And hails thy promis'd land, th' Elysian shore,
Where weeping virtue shall bewail no more!

Now, while the sounds of martial wrath assail,
While the red banner floats upon the gale;
While dark destruction, with his legion-bands,
Waves the bright sabre o'er devoted lands;
While war's dread comet flashes thro' the air,
And fainting nations tremble at the glare;
To thee, Futurity! from scenes like these,
Pale fancy turns, for heav'n-imparted ease;
Turns to behold, in thy unclouded skies,
The orb of peace in bright perspective rise;
And pour around, with joy-diffusing ray,
Life, light, and glory, in a flood of day!

Thou, whose lov'd presence and benignant smile
Has beam'd effulgence on this favour'd isle;
Thou! the fair seraph, in immortal state,
Thron'd on the rainbow, heaven's emblazon'd gate;
Thou! whose mild whispers in the summer-breeze
Control the storm, and undulate the seas;

Spirit of mercy! oh! return, to bring
Palm in thy wreath, and 'healing on thy wing!'
Compose each passion to th' eternal will,
Say to the hurricane of war,— 'Be still!'
'Vengeance, expire! thy reign, ambition, cease!
Beam, light of heaven! triumphant star of peace!'

Is this the muse's wild, illusive dream,
An airy picture, an ideal theme?
Shall death still ride victorious o'er the slain, 
And his 'pale charges' desolate the plain?
Ne'er shall revenge her vulture-pinion fold,
Close her dark eye, her lightning-arm withhold?'

Still must oppression cause th' eternal strife,
And breathe dire mildew o'er the blooms of life?
Must war still ravage with his car of fire,
And victim myriads in the blaze expire?

Supernal Pow'r! on suffering earth look down,
Tyrannic might shall perish in thy frown!

Oh! deign to speed that blest, appointed time,
When peace and faith shall smile on ev'ry clime!
But first in clouds, the dark, eventful day
Of wrath, avenging wrath! must roll away!
Thy sword, oh, Justice! o'er the world must wave,
Ere mercy dawn, to triumph and to save!

Shades of the prophet-bards! majestic train,
Who seiz'd the harp from Inspiration's fane,
And, fir'd, and guided by divine control,
Woke ev'ry chord to rapture and to soul!
Shades of the prophet-bards! in days of old,
Whose gifted hands the leaf of fate unroll'd;
Whose prescient eyes, undimm'd by age or tears,
Explor'd the avenue of distant years;
Did those blest eyes th' enchanted scene survey,
Of smiling concord's universal sway?
And did your hearts with joy exulting burn,
To see her Paradise on earth return?

Yes! hallow'd seers! to you the bliss was given,
To read, unveil'd, the dread decrees of heaven!
You saw th' oppressor's might in judgment hurl'd,
A storm of vengeance on the guilty world!
Beheld his throne revers'd, his empire past,
And peace and joy descend, serene, at last!

So when impetuous winds forget to rave,
And sun-set radiance trembles o'er the wave;
Sweet Eve, advancing o'er the summer-deep,
Charms every billow, ev'ry breeze, to sleep!

Dawn, age of bliss! but e'er thy morn shall rise,
And waft a train of cherubs from the skies;
The foes of man, who mark their deathful way,
With tears of blood, and earthquakes of dismay;
These, these must fall, a desolating band,
Fall by the darts in Retribution's hand;
And tyrants vanquish'd, humbled in the dust,
Kneel at her shrine, and own the sentence just!

Then wave, oh, Albion! wave thy sword again,
Call thy brave champions to the battle-plain!
Rise, might of nations! ardent to oppose
The rushing torrent of unpitying foes!
Soon shall they own that freedom's cause inspires,
Undaunted spirit and resistless fires!
Rise! all combin'd, 'in arms, in heart, the same,'
The arms of honor and the heart of flame!
Nor check th' avenging sword, the patriot-spear;
Till stern Ambition falls, in mid career!
Then let the falchion sleep, the combat cease,
The sun of conquest light the path of peace!
Let the green laurel with the palm entwine,
And rear on trophies bright, her firm, eternal shrine!

Dawn, age of bliss! the wounds of discord close,
Furl the red standard, bid the sword repose!
Then o'er the globe let worshipp'd freedom smile,
Bright as in Albion's truth-illumin'd isle!
Her Grecian temple rear on every shore,
Where every knee shall bend and heart adore!

Light of the ocean! day-star of the west!
Oh! Albion! Liberty's immortal fane,
Empress of isles! palladium of the main!
Tho' thy loud thunders thro' the world resound,
Tho' thy red lightnings flash victorious round;
Tho' nations own, in many a distant clime,
Thy arm triumphant, as thy name sublime;
Rock of the waves! tho' proud, from zone to zone,
Extend the pillars of thy naval throne;
Around thy coast tho' wild destruction roars,
Yet calm and fertile smile thy favor'd shores;
In emerald verdure blooms thy sunny plain,
And the dark war-blast rolls without—in vain!
Tho' flames of valor, kindling in thine eye,
Brave every storm, and every foe defy;
Yet soft, beneath its milder beam, serene, 
Luxuriance blossoms o'er the glowing scene;
Fair laugh thy vales! no deathful sounds assail,
Mirth warbles free, and music swells the gale;

While firm in might, thy victor-arm extends,
Death to thy foes, and succour to thy friends!

Thus potent Prospero's creative spell
Bade the wild surge in mountain-fury swell;
Call'd up the spirits of the raging deep,
Arous'd the whirlwind, o'er the waves to sweep;
But on th' enchanted isle, his fair domain,
Rais'd the bright vision of the sylphid train;
And bade soft notes, and fairy-warbled airs,
Melt o'er the sense, and lull corroding cares!

Smile on thy cliffs, regardless of the storm;
Favor'd of heaven! e'en thou, tho' distant far,
Hast wept the horrors of relentless war;
E'en thou hast mourn'd o'er many a hero's bier,
Grac'd with thy laurels, hallow'd with thy tear!
For those whose arms, whose blood preserv'd thee free,
(Who would not bleed, O peerless isle! for thee?)

For those who, falling on their subject-wave,
Made the dark billow glory's proudest grave;
How oft has anguish taught thy tears to flow,
Thy sighs, despondence, and thine accents, woe!

Yes! thou hast mourn'd the brave, illustrious dead,
Martyrs for thee, by faith and valor led!
When he, the warrior of the patriot-glow,
Whose ebbing life-blood stain'd Canadian snow;
When thy own Wolfe, by all thy spirit fir'd,
Triumphant fought, exulted, and expir'd;
Gave to thy fame the last, the lingering breath,
The joy in agony, the smile in death,
How swell'd thy heart with blended feeling's tide,
How sorrow paled the kindling cheek of pride!
And the bright garland, purchas'd by his doom,
Seem'd half despoil'd, and withering in its bloom!

Yes! when thy Nelson, matchless in the fight,
Bade nations own thee of resistless might;

And pouring on their heads destruction's flame,
Clos'd in its dreadful blaze a life of fame;
When the red star of conquest and of pow'r
Beam'd in full zenith on his parting hour;
Dispers'd the shadows of surrounding gloom,
And shed meridian lustre—on his tomb;
Then the sad tears which mourn'd thy gallant son,
Dimm'd the fair trophies by his prowess won;
Then patriot-sighs and consecrated grief,
Embalm'd the memory of th' undaunted chief;
Pale, weeping victory tore her laurel-crown,
And tun'd to sorrow's dirge the clarion of renown!

And thou, firm leader of th' intrepid host,
Which brav'd each peril on Iberia's coast,
Thy name, oh, Moore! thro' long, succeeding years,
Shall claim the tribute of thy country's tears!
Oh! firm in faith, in countless dangers prov'd,
In spirit lofty, and by death unmov'd!

Thine was the towering soul, disdaining fear,
And fatal valor, clos'd thy bright career! 

Illustrious Leader! in that hour of fate,
When hope and terror near the suff'rer wait;
When the pale cheek and fading eye proclaim
The last, long struggle of the trembling frame;
When the fierce death-pang vibrates every sense,
And fainting nature shudders in suspense;
E'en then thy bosom felt the patriot-flame, 
Still beat the quivering pulse at Albion's name!
In that dread hour thy thoughts to Albion flew, 
Thy parting thrill of life, thy latest throb was true!

Illustrious Leader! on that awful day,
When war and horror frown'd, in dark array;
When vengeance wav'd her fire-flag o'er the slain,
And carnage hover'd o'er Corunna's plain;
Faint with fatigue and streaming with their blood,
How nobly firm thy band of heroes stood!

'Twas their's unmov'd, unconquer'd, to oppose
Pain, famine, danger, and unnumber'd foes!
Nor toil, nor want, nor sickness then subdu'd,
The 'Lion-heart' of British fortitude!
E'en then those humbled foes their might deplor'd, 
And own'd that conquest wav'd Britannia's sword!
E'en then they fought, intrepid, undismay'd,
Death in their charge and lightning on their blade!
Yes! warrior-band! by noblest ardor led,
True to the last, ye triumph'd while ye bled!
Serene in pain, exulting 'midst alarms,
Bold, firm, invincible, your matchless arms!
Then Freedom rear'd her victor-flag on high,
Glow'd in each heart and flash'd from every eye;
England! thy glory every bosom swell'd,
England! thy spirit every arm impell'd!
MOORE! thy bright sun in fame, in victory set,
Tho' dimm'd with tears, tho' clouded with regret!
Yet shall thy trophies rear, to distant time,
High on thy native shore a Cenotaph sublime.

But, ah! bold Victory! can thy festal train,
Thy purple streamers, or thy choral strain;
Can thy proud spear, in wreaths immortal drest,
Thy radiant panoply, thy wavy crest;
Can these one grief, one bosom-pang beguile,
Or teach despair one heart-reviving smile?
Tint the pale cheek with pleasure's mantling hue,
Light the dim eye with joy and lustre new?
Or check one sigh, one sad, yet fruitless tear,
Fond love devotes to martyr'd valor's bier?

Lo! where, with pallid look and suppliant hands,
Near the cold urn th' imploring mother stands!
Fix'd is her eye, her anguish cannot weep!
There all her hopes with youthful virtue sleep!
There sleeps the son, whose op'ning years display'd
Each flatt'ring promise, doom'd so soon to fade.
Too brave, too ardent, on the field he fell,
Fame hover'd near, and Conquest rung his knell.

But could their pomp console her wounded breast,
Dispel one sigh, or lull one care to rest?
Ah! suff'ring Parent! fated still to mourn,
Ah! wounded heart!—he never shall return.

He fell!—that eye of soft and varying ray,
Where warm expression kindled into day;
Where ardor sparkled, where affection beam'd,
And youth and hope in living lustre stream'd;
That voice belov'd, whose bliss-imparting-tone,
Bade her fond heart its thrilling magic own;
That mantling cheek, where animation glow'd,
Spread the rich bloom, the vivid flush bestow'd;
That brilliant eye is clos'd in shades of night,
That voice is hush'd, that cheek no longer bright!
'Twas her's, when hope one meteor-beam had giv'n, 
(Fair form of light! sweet fugitive of heav'n!)
To see dark clouds obscure the rainbow-dream,
Watch its pale sun-set, and its closing gleam!
To see the last, the lingering bliss depart,
The lonely Day-star of her widow'd heart!

He fell!—her woe, her soul-consuming grief,
Mourns in no language, seeks for no relief;
Forbids the mind in sympathy to glow,
The voice to murmur, and the tear to flow;
But deep within, enshrin'd in silent sway, 
Dwells on each nerve—and withers life away!

Or see you Orphan-maid, in beauty's bloom,
Fair lovely mourner o'er a Father's tomb!
For him, far distant on the battle-plain,
She pray'd, and wish'd, and wept—alas!—in vain!
No tender friend receiv'd his parting breath, 
No filial sweetness cheer'd the hour of death—
For, ah! when nature most demands to share
The smile of tenderness, the hand of care;
E'en then, deserted on the field, he bled,
Unknown, unmark'd, his gallant spirit fled!
Lo! where she weeps forlorn, in anguish lost,
A frail Mimosa, blighted by the frost!
Who now shall guard the blossom of her youth, 
The gem of innocence, the flower of truth?

Sweet hapless Maid! thy only friend is gone,
Hope lingering smiles, and points to heav'n alone!

Ah! who can tell the thousands doom'd to moan,
Condemn'd by war, to hopeless grief unknown!
Thou, laureate Victor! when thy blazon'd shield,
Wears the proud emblems of the conquer'd field;
When trophies glitter on thy radiant car,
And thronging myriads hail thee from afar;
When praise attunes her spirit-breathing lyre,
Swells every tone, wakes every chord of fire;
Then could thine eyes each drooping mourner see, 
Behold each hopeless anguish, caus'd by thee;
Hear, for each measure of the votive strain,
The rending sigh that murmurs o'er the slain;
See, for each banner fame and victory wave,
Some sufferer bending o'er a soldier's grave;
How would that scene, with grief and horror fraught,
Chill the warm glow, and check th' exulting thought!

E'en in that hour, that gay, triumphal hour, 
'Midst the bright pageants of applause and pow'r;
When at thy name th' adoring Paeans rise,
And waft thy deeds in incense to the skies;
Fame in thine eyes, would veil her towering plume,
And victory's laurels lose their fairest bloom!

Power of the ruthless arm, the deathful spear,
Unmov'd, unpitying, in thy dread career;
Whom no sad cries, no mournful scenes impede,
Melt thy proud heart, or curb thy lightning-speed;
Around whose throne malignant spirits wait,
Whose path is ruin, and whose arm is fate!
Stern, dark Ambition! Typhon of the world!
Thine are the darts, o'er man in vengeance hurl'd!
'Tis thine, where nature smiles with young delight,
With fiery wing, to spread Oppression's blight;
To blast the realms with rich profusion crown'd,
Like the dire Upas, tainting all around!

Thus o'er the southern climes, luxuriant lands,
Where spreads the olive, where the vine expands;
The dread volcano bids the torrent sweep,
Rolls the fierce lava burning down the steep;
Life, beauty, verdure, fated to destroy,
Blast every bloom, and wither every joy!
Sweet orange-groves, with fruits and blossoms fair,
Which breath'd the soul of fragrance on the air;
Vineyards that blush'd, with mantling clusters grac'd,
Gay domes, erected by the hand of taste;
These mingled all in one resistless fire,
Flame to the skies, fair nature's funeral pyre!

Ambition! vainly wouldst thou gild thy name,
With specious rays of conquest and of fame;
Truth waves her wand! from her all-piercing eye,
From her Ithuriel-spear, thy glories fly!
In vain to thee may suppliant mercy kneel,
Plead with soft voice, and deprecate the steel!

Look up, with seraph-eye, in tears benign,
Smile thro' each tear, with eloquence divine;
In vain implore thee to relent and spare,
With cherub-mien and soul-dissolving pray'r:
Lost are those accents of melodious charms,
'Midst the loud clangor of surrounding arms;
Thy heart of adamant repels the strain,
Mercy! thy pray'r, thy tear, thy hope, is vain!

But can remorse, despotic pow'r! prevail, 
And wound thy bosom thro' the 'twisted mail?'
Say, can his frown, by shudd'ring conscience felt, 
Pierce the dark soul which mercy cannot melt?
No, tyrant! no, when conquest points thy way,
And lights thy track—the blood-path of dismay;
E'en then his darts, tho' barb'd with fiery pain, 
Fall from thy woundless heart, averted by disdain!


Pow'r of the ruthless arm! we see thy form,
Tow'r 'midst the darkness of the gath'ring storm;


We see thy sabre with portentous blaze,
Flash o'er the nations, trembling as they gaze;
And lo! we hear thine awful voice resound,
While fear and wonder faint, thro' empires round:
'Realms of the globe, submit! adore my pow'r!
Mine the red falchion, practis'd to devour!
Mine, dark destruction's torch of lucid light,
Mine, her keen scymitar's resistless might!
Chiefs! patriots! heroes! kneeling at my shrine,
Your arms, your laurels, and your fame, resign!
Bend, ye proud isles! my dread behest obey!
Yield, prostrate nations! and confess my sway!
Lo! the bright ensigns of supreme command,
Flame on my brow, and glitter in my hand!
Lo! at my throne what vanquish'd myriads wait,
My look, decision! and my sceptre, fate!
Ye lands, ye monarchs! bow the vassal-knee!
World, thou art mine! and I alone am free;
For who shall dare, with dauntless heart advance,
Rouse my dread arm, and brave my potent lance?'

Relentless pow'r! thy deeds from age to age,
Stain the fair annals of th' impartial page!
O'er the mild beam of order, silvery bright,
Long have thy votaries pour'd the clouds of night,
And chang'd the loveliest realms, where plenty smil'd,
To the lone desert and abandon'd wild!
Ye western regions of a brighter zone,
Ye lands that bow'd at Montezuma's throne;
Where vivid nature wears the richest dyes,
Matur'd to glory by exalting skies;
Scenes of luxuriance! o'er your blooming pride,
How ruin swept the desolating tide!
When the fierce Cortes pour'd his faithless train,
O'er the gay treasures of your fervid reign;
Taught the pure streams with crimson stains to flow,
Made the rich vales a wilderness of woe!
And swell'd each breeze of soft, ambrosial air,
With cries of death and murmurs of despair!

Peruvian realms! where wealth resplendent shines,
Thron'd in full glory, 'midst your diamond mines;

Where vegetation spreads her brightest hues,
Nurs'd by soft airs, and balm-descending dews;
Where all his beams, the worshipp'd sun bestows,
And Flora's empire to perfection glows;
O'er your gay plains, ambition spread alarms, 
When stern Pizarro rush'd with conquering arms,
Despoil'd your wealth, and ravag'd all your charms!
Ferocious leader! his aspiring soul,
Nor fear could tame, nor social ties control!
Ardent and firm, in countless dangers bold,
Dark—savage—fierce—to faith, to mercy—cold!

Then was the sword to dire oppression giv'n,
Her vulture-wing obscur'd the light of heav'n!
Thro' many a plantain-shade, and cedar-grove,
Where the blest Indian caroll'd joy and love;
The war-note swell'd upon the zephyr's calm,
The wood-nymph, Peace, forsook her bow'rs of palm!
And Freedom fled, to Andes' heights unknown,
Majestic Solitude's primaeval throne!

Where Echo sleeps, in loneliness profound,
Hears not a step, nor quivers at a sound!
Yet there the genius of eternal snows,
Mark'd far beneath, a scene of death disclose!
Saw the red combat raging on the plain,
Heard the deep dirge that murmur'd o'er the slain!
While stern Ambition wak'd th' exulting cry,
And wav'd his blazing torch, and meteor-flag, on high!

Yet, ah! not there, vindictive pow'r! alone,
Has lawless carnage rear'd thy towering throne;
For Europe's polish'd realms, thro' every age, 
Have mourn'd thy triumphs and bewail'd thy rage!
Tho' soft refinement there, o'er ev'ry land,
Spread the mild empire of her silver wand;
Erect supreme, her light Corinthian fane,
Tune the sweet lyre, and modulate the strain;
Tho' Genius there, on Rapture's pinions soar,
And worlds of ether and of fire, explore;

There, tho' Religion smile with seraph-eye,
And shed her gifts, like manna, from the sky;
While Faith and Hope, exulting in her sight,
Pour the full noon of glory's living light;
There still Ambition bids his victims bleed,
Still rolls his whirlwind, with destructive speed!
Still in his flame, devoted realms consume,
Fled is their smile and wither'd is their bloom!
With every charm has Nature's lavish hand
Adorn'd, sweet Italy! thy favor'd land!
There Summer laughs, with glowing aspect fair,
Unfolds her tints, and 'waves her golden hair;'
Bids her light sylphs delicious airs convey,
On their soft pinions, waving as they play;
O'er cluster'd grapes, the lucid mantle throw,
And spread gay life in one empurpling glow?
Paint all the rainbow on perennial flow'rs,
And shed exuberance o'er thy myrtle-bow'rs!
Verdure in ev'ry shade thy woods display,

Where soft gradations melt in light away!
And vernal sweets, in rich profusion blow,
E'en 'midst the reign of solitude and snow!
Yet what avail the bright ambrosial stores,
Which gay redundance o'er thy region pours?
Devoted land! from long-departed time,
The chosen theatre of war and crime!
What tho' for thee transcendent suns arise,
The myrtle blossoms, and the zephyr sighs;
What tho' for thee again Arcadia blooms,
And cloudless radiance all thy realm illumes;
There still has Rapine seiz'd her yielding prey,
There still Oppression spreads th' unbounded sway;
There oft has War each blooming charm effac'd,
And left the glowing vale, a bleak, deserted waste!

Is there a land, where halcyon peace has reign'd,
From age to age, in glory unprofan'd?
Has dwelt serenely in perpetual rest,
'Heav'n in her eye,' and mercy in her breast?


Ah, no! from clime to clime, with ruthless train,
Has war still ravag'd o'er the blasted plain!
His lofty banner to the winds unfurl'd,
And swept the storm of vengeance o'er the world!


If ever justice arm'd thee for the fight; 
If e'er fair truth approv'd thy dread career,
Smil'd on thy track and curb'd thy deathful spear;
Now may the generous heart exulting see, 
Those righteous powers in amity with thee!
For never, never, in a holier cause, 
Nor sanction'd e'er by purer, nobler laws;
Has Albion seiz'd the sabre and the shield,
Or rush'd impetuous to th' ensanguin'd field!

Oh! when that cause triumphant shall prevail,
And Freedom's foes her ark no more assail;
Then might thy smile, sweet Peace! thy angel-form,
Beam thro' the clouds, and tranquillize the storm!

Lo! to the Muse's bright, prophetic eyes,
What scenes unfold! what radiant visions rise!
See hand in hand, and wafted from above,
Celestial Mercy, and angelic love!
Lo! from the regions of the morning-star,
Descending seraphs bear their sun-bright car!

'High the peaceful streamers wave!
'Lo!’ they sing, 'we come to save!
'Come to smile on ev'ry shore,
'Truth and Eden to restore!
'Come, the balm of joy to bring,
'Borne on softest gales of spring!
'Rapture! swell the choral voice,
'Favor'd earth! rejoice, rejoice!

'Now the work of death is o'er,
'Sleep, thou sword! to wake no more!
'Never more Ambition's hand
'Shall wave thee o'er a trembling land!

'Never more, in hopeless anguish,
'Caus'd by thee, shall virtue languish!
'Rapture! swell the choral voice,
'Favor'd earth, rejoice, rejoice!

'Cease to flow, thou purple flood,
'Cease to fall, ye tears of blood!
'Swell no more the clarion's breath,
'Wake no more the song of death!
'Rise, ye hymns of concord, rise,
'Incense, worthy of the skies!
'Wake the Paean, tune the voice,
'Favor'd earth, rejoice, rejoice!

'Nature, smile! thy vivid grace,
'Now no more shall war deface;
'Airs of spring, oh! sweetly breathe,
'Summer! twine thy fairest wreath!
'Not the warrior's bier to spread, 
'Not to crown the victor's head; 

'But with flowers of every hue,
'Love and mercy's path to strew!
'Swell to heaven the choral voice,
'Favor'd earth! rejoice, rejoice!

'Sleep, Ambition! rage, expire!
'Vengeance! fold thy wing of fire!
'Close thy dark and lurid eye,
'Bid thy torch, forsaken, die!
'Furl thy banner, waving proud,
'Dreadful as the thunder-cloud!
'Shall destruction blast the plain?
'Shall the falchion rage again?
'Shall the sword thy bands dissever?
'Never, sweet Affection! never!
'As the halcyon o'er the ocean,
'Lulls the billow's wild commotion,
'So we bid dissension cease.
'Bloom, O Amaranth of peace!

'Twine the spear with vernal roses!
'Now the reign of discord closes!
'Freedom! triumph in our smiles!
'Blooming youth, and wisdom hoary,
'Bards of fame, and sons of glory;
'Albion! pillar of the main!
'Monarchs! nations! join the strain!
'Swell to heav'n th' exulting voice;
'Mortals, triumph! earth, rejoice!'


Oh! blissful song! and shall thy notes resound,
While joy and wonder bend entranc'd around?
And shall thy music float on every breeze,
Melt on the shores and warble o'er the seas?
Oh! mercy! love! ambassadors of heav'n!
And shall your sunshine to mankind be giv'n?
Hope! is thy tale a visionary theme?
Oh! smile, supernal pow'r! and realize the dream! 
And thou, the radiant messenger of truth,
Deck'd with perennial charms, unfading youth!
Oh! thou, whose pinions as they wave, diffuse
All Hybla's fragrance and all Hermon's dews;
Thou! in whose cause have martyrs died serene,
In soul triumphant, and august in mien!
Oh! bright Religion! spread thy spotless robe,
Salvation's mantle, o'er a guilty globe!
Oh! let thine ark, where'er the billows roll,
Borne on their bosom, float from pole to pole!
Each distant isle and lonely coast explore,
And bear the olive-branch to ev'ry shore!
Come, Seraph! come: fair pity in thy train,
Shall sweetly breathe her soul-dissolving strain;
While her blue eyes thro' tears benignly beam,
Soft as the moon-light, quivering on the stream!
Come, Seraph! come, around thy form shall play,
Diffusive glories of celestial day!
Oh! let each clime thy noon of lustre share,
And rapture hail the perfect and the fair!

Let peace on earth resound from heav'n once more,
And angel-harps th' exulting anthems pour;
While faith, and truth, and holy wisdom bind,
One hallow'd zone—to circle all mankind

Fine and all right, may be
for overcoming, surmounting and getting through
Atrocious, fearful and dreadful, for sure 
for conquering, overthrowing and power hunting

War: A Great Leveler
For
It makes
Every Voice
Dying! 



Alas! 
NO ONE SEES THE 
 OF WAR
EXCEPT
THE DEAD.. 



Eyes, limbs and other organs so treasured
For motherland, I and my mates forfeited 
Blood and flesh, in battle, we threw out
Worth the course, against which, we all fought 

I see with wit, how motherland takes a turn about
I marvel our kids enjoy the freedom, moving about 
I ponder how they feel, if they were here then 
Let them learn soon, how dreadful days we passed 

I keep watching people in day to day life
Rich, poor, young, old, men and women alike
Being busy, active, mindful and careful too
Carrying on today, with no fears of any woe

People seem to have forgotten sleepless nights 
Lingered hidden starving, for thirty years  
Many a nights they sought refuge in woods
Clung on to each other with non-beating hearts

Resurrected self I, witness smiles on faces
Overjoyed listening to free lively voices 
I reincarnate, feeling the warmth in hearts
Envision I, a resurrected land, par paradise 

Carnage of those days, no more on this land
Horrifying nightmares, shan't be recurred 
Terrorism so raunchy ’n repugnant, gone for good
Be my motherland hailed, high and bright


War is never over
 Thought the treaties may be signed
 The memories of the battles
 Are forever in our minds
 
 War is never over
 So when you welcome heroes home
 Remember in their minds they hold
 Memories known to them alone
 
 War is never over
 Nam veterans know this well
 Now other wars bring memories back
 Of their own eternal hell
 
 War is never over
 For I knew world war two
 And I'll not forget the battles
 Or the nightmares that ensue
 
 War is never over
 Those left home to wait know this
 For many still are waiting
 It was their farewell kiss
 
 War is never over
 Though we win the victory
 Still in our minds the battles 
 No freedom is not free

In winter, sprawled on soft cushions,
replete and warm, munching on chick-peas
and drinking sweet wine by the fire-
that is the time to ask each other:

As if to Odysseus:
'Who, from where, and why, art thou?'

- Or with a wink:
'And how many years are on your back, Bold-Heart?'

-Or, quietly:
'Had you yet reached man's estate, 
when the Persians came.


'I. Dead Comrades

Black bodies bubble
Silently charred
In death's dark doorways

Drowning
The bell tolls
Obsoletion

Spasms of facial contortion
Through which they no longer smile

Under fire
Under siege

Screams
Shattered minds
All manner of broken dreams

Unspun
In destiny's web

Undone
In time
Made to die     
Congealed
Without hope
Unchanged by molding hands
Unsurpassed in illness
Undreamt
 
Picture a thread through a needle
The needle in your life
Poking you
Mocking your heart
Killing you

It sees beyond the facade
Through which you try to smile


II. Post traumatic Stress Disorder

The demons in the dream scream
Flickering as flames in a grate
Whirling flitting incandescence
Rising upwards
Born upwards
In an orange tinted half light
Floating upwards
Born upwards
Spiralling
Spinning
Taunting you they float
Haunting
Grinning

A bed in the middle of a floor
A room with no walls
Windows with cracked pains
Shattered shards cut you
Pierce your soul
Your spirit hidden from you
You lie alone
Your head in your hands
Nail biting
Perpetual grimness

And all there is
A vision
Through mists and rain
Of words swirling
Of poetry peeping through keyholes
When you're sleeping
Of delightful escapism and happy moments
They taunt you
And are gone
Even before hands can grasp them

Pin your thoughts to the ground
Hang your head alone
There's no speaking when you drown


Moonlit poppies
column by row
soldiers missed.

*not traditional*Memories woven to monument towering to heaven
Of a sweet, gracious and wonderful woman.

Though she did nothing wrong, she was persecuted
Held daughter and son in arms, her man was deported.

Edgy at the brickyard, hurt in Jewish pride
Rascals put her in a jammed freight car for a railway ride.

Weary from thirst and hunger, surrounded by pain
Horror was unfolding on a rattling train.

Exhausted of the ordeal she arrived at the camps
Robbed of her freedom she stood under the lamps
Exposed to blowing snow, the barracks lacked ovens.  

A small vulnerable woman there had seen forehand
Ruthless degradations, beastly atrocities offhand.

Experienced nightmare while the sun was shining
Yet hope knocked the door when bombs were falling.

Overwhelmed by explosions, frightened, panic-stricken
Unprotected against the blasts, she shielded her children. 

Break off! Dance no more!
Danger is at the door.
Music is in arms.
To signal war's alarms. 

Hark, a sudden trumpet calling
Over the hill!
Why are you calling, trumpet, calling?
What is your will? 

Men, men, men !
Men who are ready to fight
For their country's life, and the right 
Of a liberty-loving land to be
Free, free, free!
Free from a tyrant's chain, 
Free from dishonor's stain, 
Free to guard and maintain 
All that her fathers fought for,
All that her sons have wrought for,
Resolute, brave, and free! 

Call again, trumpet, call again, 
Call up the men!
Do you hear the storm of cheers 
Mingled with the women's tears
And the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet?
Do you hear the throbbing drum
As the hosts of battle come
Keeping time, time, time to its beat? 
O Music give a song
To make their spirit strong
For the fury of the tempest they must meet. 

The hoarse roar
Of the monster guns;
And the sharp bark
Of the lesser guns;
The whine of the shells,
The rifles' clatter
Where the bullets patter,
The rattle, rattle, rattle
Of the mitrailleuse in battle,
And the yells
Of the men who charge through hells
Where the poison gas descends,
And the bursting shrapnel rends
Limb from limb
In the dim
Chaos and clamor of the strife
Where no man thinks of his life
But only of fighting through,
Blindly fighting through, through!
'Tis done
At last!
The victory won,
The dissonance of warfare past! 

O Music mourn the dead
Whose loyal blood was shed,
And sound the taps for every hero slain; 
Then lead into the song
That made their spirit strong,
And tell the world they did not die in vain. 

The invincible flag that our fathers defended;
And our hearts can repeat what the heroes have sworn,
That war shall not end till the war-lust is ended.
Then the bloodthirsty sword shall no longer be lord
Of the nations oppressed by the conqueror's horde,
But the banners of freedom shall peacefully wave
O'er the world of the free and the lands of the brave. 

Depression is a fight
Or a flight
Depression is a theif
That should be locked up
Depression steals. 
Happiness
Motivation
Sleep
 Your appetite
It steals your view on life
It steals how you view yourself
Sometimes it even steals your life


These lines are out of order
outside the world
and inside my heart.

Those soldiers are in these stanzas, 
fighting for a name or a life.
Searching for the what  butterflies carry, 
The what peoples call "a soul lost-"
To what the priests cry out "Amen".

The soldiers are in those words, 
that fly in the air, 
out of order, 
outside the world
and inside our hearts-


And whenever the black message comes 
to a wife, or fiancee, or mother, 
years and events afar, 
since we, or you, or they, give names
to the colours of the butterflies, 
- Grand-Mime is glad - 
[to have made an impression] 
to create a memory
that should be in order
inside the world
and inside my mind.
And all I wonder is why, 
- and should I? -
or we, or you, or they, 
when butterflies live so little.

War. And war some more.
War. And war some more.
No one knows, 
What it's for, 
War. And war some more.

The images seem
To rule the day, 
War and Generals, 
All the same, 
All the answers, 
Seem so lame, 
All our reason, 
Gone insane.

War. And war some more.
War. And war some more.
No one knows, 
What it's for, 
War. And war some more. 

YE who burn with glory's flame!
Ye who love the Patriot's fame;
Ye who scorn oppressive might,
Rise! in freedom's cause unite;
Castilians rise!
Hark! Iberia calls, ye brave!
Haste! your bleeding country save:
Be the palm of bright renown,
Be th' unfading laurel-crown,
The hero's prize!

High the crimson banner wave!
Ours be conquest or the grave!
Spirits of our noble sires,
Lo! your sons, with kindred fires,
Unconquer'd glow!

See them once again advance,
Crush the pride of hostile France;
See their hearts, with ardor warm,
See them, with triumphant arm,
Repel the foe!

By the Cid's immortal name,
By Gonsalvo's deathless fame;
By the chiefs of former time,
By the valiant deeds sublime,
Of ancient days;
Brave Castilians! grasp the spear!
Gallant Andalusians, hear!
Glory calls you to the plain,
Future bards, in lofty strain,
Shall sing your praise!

Shades of mighty warriors dead,
Ye who nobly fought and bled;

Ye whose valor could withstand,
The savage Moor's invading band
Untaught to yield;
Bade victorious Charlemagne,
Own the patriot-arms of Spain;
Ye, in later times renown'd,
Ye who fell with laurels crown'd,
On Pavia's field!

Teach our hearts like yours to burn;
Lawless pow'r like you to spurn;
Teach us but like you to wield,
Freedom's lance and Freedom's shield
With daring might:
Tyrant! soon thy reign is o'er,
Thou shalt waste mankind no more;
Boast no more thy thousands slain,
Jena's, or Marengo's plain;
Lo! the sun that gilds thy day,
Soon will veil its parting ray,
In endless night

Our soldiers wear it proudly on their chest
And it makes them stand out from the rest
It is only given to soldiers who have been in combat
With laurels and a bayonet in bronze with a pin on the back
So when you see one in a personal display 
That soldier has fought for us in harm's way
It's the Infantry Combat Badge awarded 
For them for their courage afforded.


In the interest of a lasting peace, 
We will go into war, 
Has anyone ever simply asked what do we do it for? 

Can the answer possibly be as simple as this more dead bodies, and a few less grins. 

However it is very interesting to note, 
This time it is different, 

We are not bogged down in the jungle, 
We are not fighting knee high in rice fields. 
This time the war has been brought 
To our very own home ground 

As the terrorists so insightfully knew, 
Americans swore to get even as our great WTC blew. 

Now the terrorists awakened a giant and with all of our might, 
We entered Afghanistan to put an end this fight, 

We started in Afghanistan, 
We are now headed to Iraq 

Why stop there are we all done? 
How about North Korea, Iran, or some place else? 
How can you ever know when we are through? 
Is it even possible to do what we are trying to do? 

Can you ever win, 
Or could you even loose, 
If you didn't do anything would that even do! 

This is the question about me or you, 
Do you really want to start a war that will end 

Sometime in our grand children's lifetime? 
Would a short war instead be better? 

My motives are pure, we have been under attack, 
Sure we should return and fight back. 
And storm the very gates of the capital of Iraq! 

My question posed here is not actually new, 
All I ask is this what can we do? 

Can you stop all wars and make people not fight, 
Can you always tell people just to do right! 

The answers are simple, the problems are complex, 
Just how can we get ourselves out of this mess? 

What have we learned in Vietnam, 
That we possible could do this time around. 

Have we learned that maybe we should fight against this pest 
Fight against terror, put them to rest! 

War. what are fighting for, 
We are fighting to live more. 

We simply can not go and let things boil over 
Watch without action any more. 

Our fight is against terror, 
Our mission is clear, 
This is clearly a war we will win. 
War, could it be we are actually fighting it to save me and you! 



Could it possibly be, this is the time, 
This is the place, this is the war, and this is out fight

An Australian day is dawning bright and new 
In a wide bright sky forever painted azure blue
Kookaburras laugh greeting the sun's arrival
The steam engine strains awaiting its revival
And I see them together in love's fond embrace
The train leaving from home in god's good grace
Then a ship to France to end the War.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

Proud khaki men in hats turned up at the side 
In a uniform for hard work and not parade ground pride
Excited voices singing of the legend of the Dardanelles
They are South Australians on their way to Hell
For them it's not Anzac Cove and Johnny Turk 
Fair Dinkum they are and Flanders will be their work
And they know the cold and clear devil's arithmetic.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

The steam engine whistles the time to leave
It's a great adventure now with no time to grieve
Berlin or Bust chalked on the carriage with flare
The Huns can't beat us - Australia will be there
Their promise sincerely given I'll return back to you
Girls in Sunday best on train steps like glue
And she is there as always held in his embrace.  

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

At Outer Harbour the ships are duly loaded
Her streamer breaks and in her pocket carefully folded
She thinks of him so proud and wipes away a tear
Through long nights alone her anxiety well founded
The priest visits others so her fear well grounded
But she will not let such thoughts to linger long.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze	
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

The ship rolls on for soldier's drills and practice
It's all routine and sergeant's shout without malice 
But it's a dry argument and a man could use a drink
King Neptune calls his court and joining him they do think
But the Spanish death is unleashed and one is given to the sea
This one is the gate keeper and will be holding the key
For others in those sad days ahead for Australia's sons. 

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

Heroes are hailed as they dock at Durban's fair port
The Angel of Durban invites him in and gives her support 
On her veranda she smiles and entertains with great pluck
The Signaller as usual flashes goodbye and good luck
Their journey continues on to England and Salisbury Plain
Learning the bayonet and gun its importance is to gain
An upper hand needed but will it temper Maxim's gun? 

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

To Flanders Fields and Somme mud the battle joined
With never-ending bloody death and destruction purloined 
Tommy pals are gone in the first day brawls
One time as a messenger over gained ground he crawls
Struggling through for his mates to take vital word 
Playing dead where the Boche advance occurred 
His bravery marked by a few lines in daily despatches.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

The days into years he struggles through the war haze
Stand Hardy through those long dark days 
So strong in mateship the Anzac Legend is the go
But Mateship doesn't stop gas as his mask is too slow
To the Clearing Station as a casualty lying in here
Some thinking nothing's wrong we are all in good cheer
Then the blood fills their lungs as the gas wins again.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

These were terrible days of sacrifice not impeded 
The Boche attack that nearly succeeded
To win before the Dough Boys flood they all agree 
Refugees with their stacked carts fleeing until they see
No need to leave now the Australians are here! 
Hold strong with the British horseman give them a cheer
High is the price paid by them and by holding they finally win.
 
Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears


The March to Victory rips through their trench line
It's a black day for the German Army so sublime
They agree to swallow the bitterest of pills
But the fighting is hard and the war still kills
At the end the Anzacs are in reserve their fighting is done
The end of the war to end all wars has finally come
The Eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

The wait for a ship to home is so lonely and long
Monash's plan for troops is for peace so strong
For what is needed now is a job and to leave France
But still some are called to the Spaniard's dance 
Hacking is the cough until you breathe will not come
For some who survived the mud, shell and gun
Lie now as heroes in General Ware's villages of the dead.
 
Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

At last a ship for home and to re-join his love
The worst has passed. Oh! Praise god up above 
Each day she waits for the loneliness to end
And she will be there with no need to pretend
Still nightmares will linger and many will struggle
The war has left them with many things to puzzle 
The ship docks home and their life will begin again.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

Their marriage and promises are as light as a feather
The grand steps to start anew with a life altogether
He builds her a home and picks the pieces all up
For her and their children it's his communal cup
But the war is not finished as it tightens its grip 
His life is for family but his health starts to slip
For the gas has lingered and so the end begins.
 
Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

His cough bites into the night so he buries his head
She hears the hacking and tries not to dread
But the blood in his handkerchief has different views
The doctor in judgement gives them the terrible news
He will not go on and his death will be soon  
There will be no glory now with the old platoon
It will not be quick and clean with the bullet's dull thud. 

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

They lose their life and any dreams of a secure future
His work at an end and a refused pension no nurture
They say the throat cancer has no link to his warrior fight
She rips the official letter for the decision's not right
There is no grateful nation to look after them now
For her a long journey it is hard to know how
To see his last days in the Daws Road Hospital.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

For twelve months he struggles in the fight of his life
His strong Anzac spirit sees him suffer in his strife
Her sister provides shelter and in exhaustion she sleeps 
His time is at end and the heavy burden she keeps 
That night the sisters around the kitchen table they sat
His army photo on the wall and his dog on the mat
They talk into the late night about his time now spent.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

The family dog is awake and looks to the wall
A wagging tail for his master again to enthral 
Her sisters are frightened and cower back in embrace
But he just smiles and takes their fear all away
His family is important and it's hard not to stay
To say goodbye is his wish as his final journey has begun.  

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

He walks from the room with the dog at his feet
Through each bedroom to them his family to greet
The final time for this life he tells of his love
Back to the sisters he assures of his watch from above
He departs them now leaving no fear of death's end
He speaks to one sister of good times a dear friend
If you are worried it will be the gladiolas in bloom.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears


He disappears as he came in a wispy grey fog 
They sit in silence with their thoughts now to log
A policeman comes to tell them of a life now lost
The family now paying together the great cost
Each day's a struggle as the years roll by
She is strong for her family and tries not to cry
In all her days she knows and lives to see him again. 

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

Those days are no more and the memories fade
No more of her lonely life from him will be made 
That wonderful lady whose love was so freely given
Is now in his arms forever a paradise now is living 
Never again apart in eternity's fond grasp
She is content and all of life's struggles have past
As it was once for them in those times so long ago.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please
And never disappears

O Hail all our heroes of trench, mud and barbed wire
Of the others who loved them waiting time to transpire
Of those short years together after the raging storm 
Of the struggling time forgotten was their life's norm
Of her aching for him in those long lonely years
For they deserved the best but received only tears 
Their lasting gift for us all was love freely given.

Love is just a whisper on a summer breeze
That caresses through the years
With a longing heart to please	
And never disappears.



There was a reserve of civilian nurses who volunteered first
Who were patriotic to serve Australia in hearts to burst
So these nurses went to War with the men 
And sometimes with brothers and fathers the AIF then

They were at The Landing of Gallipoli's fatal shore
Where it was difficult to stage a CCS to triage wounds and more
They took wounded and sick troops on the ships anchored near
Where 'black ships' we're used to transport the wounded in fear

These nurses were under fire from the Turkish held hills quite clear
One nurse whilst treating a wounded soldier on board quite near
A Turkish bullet from the shore killed him outright in front of her
Underlining how much danger they were in and safety was unsure

These brave women were able to use the title 'ANZAC' because of this
When they were under fire at ANZAC Cove dodging bullets as no bliss
And they stayed with the troops winning Military Medals by the War's finish
Being mentioned in despatches a  hundreds of times their bravery undiminished.


With rebel cockade in my hat, 
Though friends may desert me, and kindred disown, 
My country will never do that! 
You may sing of the Shamrock, the Thistle, the rose, 
Or the three in a bunch, if you will; 
But I know of a country that gathered all those, 
And I love the great land where the Waratah grows. 
And the Wattle-bough blooms on the hill. 

Australia! Australia! so fair to behold- 
While the blue sky is arching above; 
The stranger should never have need to be told, 
That the Wattle-bloom means that her heart is of gold. 
And the Waratah's red with her love. 

Australia! Australia! most beautiful name, 
Most kindly and bountiful land; 
I would die every death that might save her from shame, 
If a black cloud should rise on the stand; 
But whatever the quarrel, whoever her foes, 
Let them come! Let them come when they will! 
Though the struggle be grim, 'tis Australia that knows 
That her children shall fight while the Waratah grows, 
And the Wattle blooms out on the hill. 

Do you burn incense? ? 
 Do you like the willowy tendrils of aroma
 caressing your lithe body.. 
today when I smelt lavender 
I thought of you and 
of the possibility of smuggling the fragrance
 into your realm through the many treacheries of time -

 I couldn’t find any courier, carrier or courtier-
 so it remains -atremble..
a captive in its glass mausoleum..
 un-smelt, unborn
 so there will be irate oracles 
on tangent as their haughty nostrils 
were not flooded with the waft of supplication; 
there will be burials unwept 
as the ephemeral balm of ritual 
went sadly  amiss 
. 

I’m resigned to a life
Undrencehed in the lavender
Of your love
till a new uprising, 
till a new intrigue or 
till a courtier carrier or a courier.. 
lighter than breath 
is born -

WHEN the beagles are running like steam, 
When the plough is as sticky as glue, 
When the scent is an absolute scream, 
And there's wire in the fence to get through 
Who waits to look after his pal ? 
Hung up? then he's out of the fun. 
Torn, muddy, and blown, every man on his own 
That's the time-honoured rule of the run. 

There's wire in the fences of France. 
There are bullets that whistle and spit. 
The word goes along to advance, 
And the wire clutches somebody's kit. 
' Hold hard ! I'll unhook you, old chap. 
No hurry. Oh, rubbish  What rot!' 
Shots patter and thud, shells burst in the mud. 
' Don't pull ! Now, you're clear no, you're not!' 

Well, that is how the business is done. 
A sportsman will brook no delay, 
With hounds it's life and death run, 
He's out for himself all the way. 
But when black Eternity gapes 
There's time and there's patience enough. 
A case of 'ware wire, and a pal under fire 
' No hurry ' that's British-made stuff 

Language, religion, 
poverty, greed
are the causes  
of many an 
inhuman deed. 

Political passion tends to churn the skies into an ocean
Releasing rats of illusion
How many more lies need to be poured? 
Heart beats defeated in war
Confusion beckons
Fighting merely for survival
Living far from the truth-
Peace lies weak amid all compactness 
Struggling for his lives
Stabbing off ridiculous thrust
Painting blasphemous pictures
Wrapped with politeness and sweetness
It says "we’re comrades, but the lost comrades"
Complementing on each other
With poison kept in hands
Ego fed by the Master 
Who was later clowned by the servants
When would this be ended? 
How many more lives to be served
On dinner plates. 


Lives that pierce and penetrate hearts
Curses hurled at you
Harvester of war seeds
You grow them and run-
The pleasure you gained out of others' tears
Burning the rocks of the Sun
To feel your adopted wolves that you freed
Now chewing you-
In a slow death
Did you realize what you have done? 
Don’t you have a heart any more? 
I feel so upset
For the Prince of truth, 
Who could be lying dead 
On eternity's plateau? 


Black crows flying low above stinky corpses
Poured into wax molds
Their drippings emit foul smells
The heat could have grinded the crying
But I still see you’re hiding behind the moon
Laughing out loud at your victims, 
Who are starting to freeze? 
Drinking up infant’s sweat from the Sun’s shadows
Fulfilling your wild urge
How many more will you sacrifice? 
Using friends as your shield 
From millions of bullets
That come your way
And the rains raining blood
Flooding your damned soul
Their bloods that you've poured into the mold

Open your eyes oh Warlords! 
The blood squeeze will submerge, 
Your pride 
Thrown into the Black hole
Staying for long in Hell
Baptizing you-
Could you atone for all the sins? 
Your sins are larger than the flames of Hell! 
How are you going to pay? 


       MAKE LOVE NOT WAR!  * _ *Warm in her Hand these accents lie
While faithful and afar
The Grace so awkward for her sake
Its fond subjection wear -Warm summer sun,
    Shine kindly here,
Warm southern wind,
    Blow softly here.
Green sod above,
    Lie light, lie light.
Good night, dear heart,
    Good night, good night. 

The warmth of bedsheets, 
Irish coffee, hold the coffee, 
my fingers tracing through
your hair, 
and your sweaty cheek
resting on my chest. 

That amazing feeling
when you thought your heart was stone cold
but then something
in you
changes
the skies all of a sudden aren't dark anymore
you feel alive
the sun hugs you
the wind sings to you the songs of love stories come true
you gain hope again
and you don't feel so sad anymore
the weight lifts off of your shoulders
you can breathe
you smell the air
and you start to remember
that feeling of happiness
then you feel it return
that warmth


When I am an old woman I shall wear purple
With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.
And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves
	                        

	                        
	                          .  
	                        

	                        
	                          .  


With a red hat which doesn't go, and doesn't suit me.
And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves
And satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter.
I shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired
And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells
And run my stick along the public railings
And make up for the sobriety of my youth.
I shall go out in my slippers in the rain
And pick flowers in other people's gardens
And learn to spit.

You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat
And eat three pounds of sausages at a go
Or only bread and pickle for a week
And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.

But now we must have clothes that keep us dry
And pay our rent and not swear in the street
And set a good example for the children.
We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.

But maybe I ought to practice a little now?
So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised
When suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple. 

Inside everybody's nose
There lives a shar-toothed snail.
So if youi stick your finger in,
He may bite off your nail.
Stick it farther up inside,
And he may bite your ring off.
Stick it all the way, and he
May bite the whole darn thing off

Negroes,
Sweet and docile,
Meek, humble and kind:
Beware the day
They change their mind!
Wind
In the cotton fields,
Gentle Breeze:
Beware the hour
It uproots trees

it's not rocket science
I'm no brain surgeon
the name's not Einstein
don't expect miracles


Children, if you dare to think
Of the greatness, rareness, muchness
Fewness of this precious only
Endless world in which you say
You live, you think of things like this:
Blocks of slate enclosing dappled
Red and green, enclosing tawny
Yellow nets, enclosing white
And black acres of dominoes,
Where a neat brown paper parcel
Tempts you to untie the string.
In the parcel a small island,
On the island a large tree,
On the tree a husky fruit.
Strip the husk and pare the rind off:
In the kernel you will see
Blocks of slate enclosed by dappled
Red and green, enclosed by tawny
Yellow nets, enclosed by white
And black acres of dominoes,
Where the same brown paper parcel -
Children, leave the string alone!
For who dares undo the parcel
Finds himself at once inside it,
On the island, in the fruit,
Blocks of slate about his head,
Finds himself enclosed by dappled
Green and red, enclosed by yellow
Tawny nets, enclosed by black
And white acres of dominoes,
With the same brown paper parcel
Still untied upon his knee.
And, if he then should dare to think
Of the fewness, muchness, rareness,
Greatness of this endless only
Precious world in which he says
he lives - he then unties the string.

Harsh words & violent blows
Hidden secrets nobody knows
Eyes are open, hands are fisted
Deep inside I'm warped & twisted
So many tricks & so many lies
Too many whens & too many whys
Nobody's special, nobody's gifted
I'm just me, warped & twisted
Sleeping awake & choking on a dream
Listening loudly to a silent scream
Call my mind, the number's unlisted
Lost in someone so warped & twisted
On my knees, alive but dead
Look at the invisible blood I've bled
I'm not gone, my mind has drifted
Don't expect much, I'm warped & twisted
Burnt out, wasted, empty, & hollow
Today's just yesterday's tomorrow
The sun died out, the ashes sifted
I'm still here, warped & twisted


Warriors
Horses and warriors
Shields and amour
Fighting for a cause
Avoiding as much loss


How many men will be killed? 
For a country
For a nation
For self belief

Spears and shields
Tools of war
Making history
Alliance and victory

A treasured sword
Held by a courageous man
Known by his name as warrior
Failure is not an option
A countries pride is at stake

Bows and arrows
Fighting for a name
Decorated with strings of fame
A man must do what he must
Even if it is for a mediocre cause

Now wars are won and fought with guns
The true warriors are the thinkers and not the fighters
The true warrior is not the man who dies
But the one who stays alive
The one who can plan and strategise
Analyse and fantasies a vision which is bound to come true

when i listen utterances, 
reverberating in my mind, 
these are not melodies, 
but dances of hunger and sickness, 
over the broken crusts of earth, 
In downtowns on real grounds. 
where sky burns and ashes, 
soar in hurricane winds.
where breeze does not mean, 
and fires of war rain with blood, 
and clouds of dark smokes, 
and cannon rumbles shake the hearts, 
Where life is deeper than graves, 
and death may give it up, 
embracing the tragic, 
Can man find himself? 
with wavering wisdom, 
gripping necks with shaking hands, 
with suffered tolerance, 
In house of fantasies.
with open eyes, 
and buried dreams,There’s so much hatred round the place
The world seems not to care
For though we travel into space
There’s fighting in the air

We’ll share our wealth to see a fool
Women to fight in mud
Patently stand and watch a pool
Formed by another’s blood

There’s violence, and wars galore
Conflicts where none can win
Religion; even will close its door
To someone else’s skin

When will this foolish practice cease? 
When will man’s conflict end
When will the earth solicit peace? 
And call each neighbour friend

When will we see, world eyes are blind? 
Her ears no longer hear
Perceive at last she’s lost her mind? 
And lives in total fear

She needs to see there’s something more
She needs to feel some love
She needs to see what life is for
And search for truth above

To see she’s not alone
See Satan losing much more ground

Through prayer on bended knee
Through endless praise till Heaven sings
Till love flows swift and free


Would the world feel different if I were to let go? 
Would the shells of our bodies be able to smile a little more? 
Would you, the soulmate I have yet met, know to feel a gaping hole in your heart? 

Would you, the memories that will not cease to plague me, finally learn to end? 


In the world that is a playground, 
In this life that is the sandbox, 
would you have enough humanity to handle my heart with a fraction of care? 
-I once thought, long ago, that I deserved more than this. 

Was it heaven or hell? 
Old as they were to young to know.
I hope they are well, 
wherever they go.

They cursed on Fridays, 
and prayed on Sundays.
So how could I know, 
where they may go? 

They were kind souls, 
but their life was filled with holes.
I wonder what they were thinking, when they died.
Did the Death Angel look them in the eye? 

There are many questions to ask, 
but I'll wait for someone else to pass.
So what was it, did they do life swell.
It's either heaven or hell. 

No one, 
and I do mean no one, 
will stay with you forever.

With time, 
even your name they won't remember.

I've learned to no longer give of myself
what I can never take back, 
once given away. 

Do I have to cry myself to sleep, 
mourning the loss of a love I thought of so highly? 

Or deprive myself from quality time with no one but myself
so the memory of us does not sting? 

Truth is, 
love has retreated, 
and I am unsure
whether you loved me
for me, 
or for 'me.'

But how could it be that you, 
whom I held above the skies, 
are simply turning away from all we had? 

How could it be that you, 
the one person for whom I have ever left another person, 
are leaving me with no valid explanation? 

How could it be that I, 
the one who has tried a countless number of times to avoid such heartache, 
be drenched in pain all over again? 

I gave you my love and my self, 
and gave in to your words and your touch.

I must have lost my purpose in loving you, 
and oh how my heart aches at the sound
of your memory.

I do not regret letting you hold me, 
and I need not your sympathy
now that I am broken, 

because one does not feel sorry for a glass heart one has purposely shattered.

I know that time
will let fade all traces of my existence
and turn me a blurry memory
hidden in the niche of your unconscious.

All I hope is one day in your sleep
you will see me again, 
and remember how my smell
Lingered on your shirt
just as yours did on mine, 
And how each of us pulled the other hopelessly close
with a desperate need to find completion in the lack of distance between us.


I guess the crevice
we were seeking to clinch
was less physical
than it was emotional, 
for even the scraping of skin was apparently not enough. 

That last love experience has instilled in me the certainty that
she who loves with her all, is bound to lose her all, 
Possibly to a lover who was never meant to stay.  

when i was listening to my heart's beating
i woke up by a knock on the door
my heart stopped; i felt afraid
i wondered, i asked: who's that? 
but i had to open the door
now or before. 
when i opened the door
i saw someone whom i knew before
he was crying, and a little alarming
he said that your lover has died
i couldn't belive, when he said that thing
is it real or i'm dreamimg? 
then i found out that it was real
i wasn't dreaming and i had to believe
at that time the sorrow comes
without permission or knocking door
only two ways that i had to go
killing myself or living alone.. 

Adam and Eve were overcame
By Satan in the Garden of Eden
Since then man has been possessed
By an evil spirit which quite  obsessed
To tempt and drag the soul to damnation

Everyone is prone to commit mistakes
No good man is his life has never done fakes
Especially at times when something is at stake
Life, honor and love are those posted out for the take 
We all succumb to temptations to Satan's evil wishes

Everyday life's tribulations have got into our way
Filling us with sorrows, frustrations and dismay
Exciting the demonic instincts lurking inside us
Compel human to do bad things which are unjust
Why man was born to hurdle the pains of the world

All day the blanket snapped and swelled
on the line, roused by a hot spring wind
  From there it witnessed the first sparrow,
early flies lifting their sticky feet,
and a green haze on the south-sloping hills.
Clouds rose over the mountain. . 

At dusk
I took the blanket in, and we slept,
restless, under its fragrant weight. 

Overshadows in blue
They lapse over our lives 
Like marker bleeding through paper
These distressing times of pain and hurt

Memories are like washed up trash
Thrown to the shore by the crashing waves
Maybe there is a reason it is back to the surface
Someone just needs to trash the junk forever


Myne mynde to me a tumbledryere ysse, 
where muste I watche my scrumpled, worn-oute thoughtes
seeke their redemptione in Hys watere’s grace; 
thynkes-bubbles that do forme and burste in ayre, 
thysse mynde’s so constant turmoyle withouten cease; 

O maye I humble sitte and contemplayte
the roundel windowe of drye thoughte contained
and I, the watchere of myne turbulence, 
Thy watchere aye; ’til time and change begone. 

I kiss your sloppy hands
before I wash them.
You don't resist my care.
Instead your head falls back, 
and a tiny yawn creases your cheeks.

Your eyes shut tightly, 
and I wonder what they see
inside your head. Is there another
darkness there, different from the night? 

Or do you see a light
that only children know, 
a light so dim in me
it can no longer trick my eyes

Come, happy people! Oh come let us tell
The story of Washinton and Lincoln!
History's pages can never excel
The story of Washington and Lincoln.
Down through the ages an anthem shall go,
Bearing the honors we gladly bestow--
Till every nation and language shall know
The story of Washington and Lincoln:

Who gave us independence,
On our continent and sea
Who saved the glorious Union!
And set a people free!
This is the story--
Oh happy are we--
The story of Washington and Lincoln.

Parents to children shall tell with delight,
The story of Washington and Lincoln;
Free born and freed men together recite
The story of Washinton and Lincoln.
Earth's weary bond men shall listen with cheer--
Tyrants shall tremble, and traitors shall fear--
When, in it's fullness of glory, they hear
The story of Washington and Lincoln:

Though on the war cloud recorded with steel,
The story of Washington and Lincoln;
Peace only Peace, can completely reveal
The story of Washington and Lincoln.
Thanks for the unsullied flag we unfold!
Thanks to us, and in our time, was told
The story of Washington and Lincoln. 

we sat in Washington Square Park
on a slatted wood bench in the sun
your hair was tied back
and your face flushed pink with little beads of sweat

I stared at your breasts
while you peeled a grapefruit
and we spit the seeds into your paper bag

we walked back to the studio on sixth avenue
it was time for your class
and I had to catch a bus
we kissed for the first time

and when I turned to leave I could have cried
for that moment which would never be repeated
it's the damnedest thing how they never repeat


West of Bengal is now past, 
Waste of Bengal is now just.
Reds were defeated, and they came.
Change in words-all are same.
Hope of masses are ready to die, 
Full of promises - nothing but lie.

Someone put their baby brother
Under this basket- -
The question is exactly why,
But I'm not going to ask it.
But someone, I ain't sayin' who,
Has got a guilty face,
Ashamed for lettin' such a lovely brother
Go to waste. 

hours go by slow
the day goes by fast
and for every second we waste
we lose a minute
and for every lost minute
we could of had a moment of happiness
because happiness, even though its abundant
its rare to find it in everybody


At the height of my hysteria
While I was yet again choking on my tears

I realized just how many tears
I've shed for all of you
Over the years

Wasted is how I view them
Because wasted is what they are

And each tear plummeted down my face
It left behind a never fading scar

My precious tears none of you deserved
And the satisfaction of knowing I've shed then
Is what you've gained

But none of you care in the least
That shedding those tears
cruelly caused me so much pain

So I dry my eyes for the last time
And I hope you enjoyed that last show


Because I'm done wasting my tears on you
And am lettting you-
And all of the misery
Gountil then
the moon never says
that it understands
the language of the
night
she is immersed
in the darkness
she is floating
in that immense
space
she is inside something
that does not
too understand
the meaning of 
its light.  

While I was praying yesterday I started wondering 
what it would be like to hear an unprocessed audio 
feed of everyone in the world who was praying at 
that very moment. It would be like thousands of 
muttering voices all at once, like an avalanche of 
prayer. It would sound so incomprehensible and 
hears and somehow he makes sense out of it. I 
wonder if he ever gets bored and plays around with 
the sound, maybe runs the signal though some 
studio effects like a digital delay or a phase shifter 
or even an overdrive. Now THAT would be cool. 
always listening to could use this idea to create 
some truly innovative and experimental music. Nah, 
probably not. They’re all so hopelessly lame. Hey, 
why do they all wear their electric guitars riding so 
high across their chests


Watch The Kangaroo's Jump
Oh, watch the Kangaroo's jump
they look like they are having fun 
jumping around in the sun, 

Look at the weak; 
what do you see? 
tears do fall upon  the sand 
gently winds do blow 
way before a nasty storm, 

Life is like a mirror 
that reflects all that you see 
Oh, innocents let out your sigh
and hold on tight 
you are about to go for a ride, 

Hear comes alarming colored sky
shadows of fright makes a storm 
like never before; 
Sing your song on high 
you innocent ones 
with lyrics on your lips, 

Oh, beloved ones; 
watch the Kangaroo's jump 
they are no longer looking 
like they are having fun
the old sun is gone 
they are now jumping on wet ground, 

Oh, you Neglected ones 
let your love be strong 
while you dance around 
in a darken storm.







I watch his mouth move, 
his lips; 
they hypnotize me.

They are sensuous; 
alive in their movements

I like the way they 
form vowels; 
the top one curls
with the word 'so'
form vowels 
like 'oh' deliciously; 

and the bottom one
to pouts at me
both open softly
his white teeth showing.

He  says
'hummmm'
and they rest
one atop the other
soft sound vibrating them
on their fleshy palette..

I remember best
those lips

pouting outward 
slightly
saying 'I do'

I remember his lips
saying 'I do'
at the wedding.

I 'll always love those lips
Still do. 

Watching life go bye
A moot point
flying around
Condenses here in space time
Hear the happy bird singing
Take a bow forever


Baby

Like flowers reaching for Sun, baby sucks ma's breast.
Petals open kissed by light, baby smiles content.
Dew drops evaporate, toddler plays on grass.
Butterflies flirt with flowers, he gurgles and laughs. 

Kid

Whole creation is alive, youthful and so bright.
Tiny necks peep out of  shell, ready for maiden flight.
Ma stands with Tiffin at gate, child hops into van.
Soon the van goes out of sight, things go well as planned.

Youth

Birds  twittering day long, youth strums on guitar.
Dusk falls and shadows lengthen, a girl comes in car.
A  magical hour, twilight.  Walking hand in hand, 
Light breeze caresses the leaves, ma smiles as she stands.

Man

The night is young, air fragrant; sound of wedding bells.
Stars twinkle, full moon so bright, sound of conch shell.
The whole cosmos celebrates, as the feast is spread.
The clock strikes the midnight hour, together break bread. 


I saw the shelling of the houses 
I saw the planes and bombs and tanks.
I saw the women and children dying, 
I saw the river’s bloody banks.

I saw the lies and all the rumors, 
I saw the president standing tall.
I saw the shock and the awe was awesome, 
I saw the stupidity of it all.

I saw the meaningless death and carnage, 
I saw the beating of the chest.
I saw the women and children dying, 
I saw the pain of all the rest.

I saw our reason disappearing, 
I saw the pundits tell us why.
I saw the hopeless helpless anger, 
I saw Cindy Shehan cry.

I saw the president on vacation, 
I saw the torture, how it thrived. 
I saw the women and children dying, 
I saw the names of the dead held high.

I saw the face in the mirror screaming, 
I saw the insanity never stop.
I saw the war go on forever, 
I saw the smiles at the very top. 

Three little forms in the twilight gray,
Searching the shadows across the way;
Two pair of black eyes, and one of blue --
Brimful of love, and of mischief too;
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

May, with her placid and thoughtful brow,
Beaming with kindness and love just now;
Willie the youngest, in anguish did lay,
Stealing sly kisses from sister May,
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

Nellie, with ringlets of sunny hue,
Cosily nested between the two;
Pressing her cheeks to the window pane,
Wishing the absent one home again.
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Sitting by the window,
Watching for Pa!

Now there are shouts from the window seat;
There is a patter of childish feet;
Gaily they rush through the lighted hall --
"Coming at last" is the joyful call.
Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Standing on the doorstep,
Watching for Pa!

Watching for Pa!
Watching for Pa!
Standing on the doorstep,
Watching for Pa

They say watching someone you love 
Love someone else
Is the hardest thing you can do.
But did they know that it
Can also snap you in two? 
Rip out your heart and disconnect 
Your soul, 
Make you weep every night alone
In the cold, 
From being alive and ok with things, 
Your mind turns to black, 
And the hatred it brings
Makes you aware of yourself, 
For better, for worse, 
In sickness, in health, 
Suddenly it seams 
You’re in your own personal hell
You know not from where 
It was that you fell, 
And all this because 
I love you with all, 
But all I got in return 
Was another brick wall. 

and all. But did he intervene? Nope. 

cross and the blood flowed out of his hands, what 
He didn’t bother to lift a finger to save his son. 

Maybe he even enjoyed the spectacle. Well, probably 
not, but there’s no way to know for sure.

So next time you go to pray for something, just remember: 
an agonizing death, but surely he’ll take notice and 
respond to your self-serving bleatings, right

I’ve seen the late and lonely night.
I’ve seen it breaking toward the day, 
I’ve seen it fading; fighting light.

I’ve seen the sun just barely bright
I’ve seen my dreams just barely stay, 
I’ve seen the late and lonely night.

I’ve seen the sky turn red with fright
I’ve seen the darkened pinkish fray, 
I’ve seen it fading; fighting light.

I’ve seen the ball creep to it’s height
And though now sudden, full of play, 
I’ve seen the late and lonely night.

Now reds and orange, blues and white
The black is banished with the rays, 
I’ve seen it fading; fighting light.

The orb now full, and in it’s might, 
Peace stills my heart, and makes me say: 
I’ve seen the late and lonely night.
I’ve seen it fading; fighting light. 

Everything on the earth bristled, the bramble
pricked and the green thread
nibbled away, the petal fell, falling
until the only flower was the falling itself.
Water is another matter,
has no direction but its own bright grace,
runs through all imaginable colors,
takes limpid lessons
from stone,
and in those functionings plays out
the unrealized ambitions of the foam. 

I was born in a drouth year. That summer
my mother waited in the house, enclosed
in the sun and the dry ceaseless wind,
for the men to come back in the evenings,
bringing water from a distant spring.
veins of leaves ran dry, roots shrank.
And all my life I have dreaded the return
of that year, sure that it still is
somewhere, like a dead enemys soul. 
Fear of dust in my mouth is always with me,
and I am the faithful husband of the rain,
I love the water of wells and springs
and the taste of roofs in the water of cisterns.
I am a dry man whose thirst is praise
of clouds, and whose mind is something of a cup.
My sweetness is to wake in the night
after days of dry heat, hearing the rain. 

It was a Maine lobster town—
each morning boatloads of hands
pushed off for granite
quarries on the islands,

and left dozens of bleak 
white frame houses stuck
like oyster shells
on a hill of rock,

and below us, the sea lapped
the raw little match-stick 
mazes of a weir,
where the fish for bait were trapped.

Remember? We sat on a slab of rock.
From this distance in time
it seems the color
of iris, rotting and turning purpler,

but it was only 
the usual gray rock
turning the usual green
when drenched by the sea.

The sea drenched the rock
at our feet all day,
and kept tearing away 
flake after flake.

One night you dreamed
you were a mermaid clinging to a wharf-pile,
and trying to pull
off the barnacles with your hands.

We wished our two souls 
might return like gulls
to the rock. In the end, 
the water was too cold for us. 

Creating all lives, 
Nurtures them all till, 
Ending of lives

Where the water-lilies go
To and fro,
Rocking in the ripples of the water,
Lazy on a leaf lies the Lake King's daugher,
And the faint winds shake her.
Who will come and take her?
I will! I will!
Keep still! Keep still!
Sleeping on a leaf lies the Lake King's daughter


Then the wind comes skipping
To the lilies on the water;
And the kind winds wake her.
Now who will take her?
With a laugh she is slipping
Through the lilies on the water.
Wait! Wait!
Too late, too late!
Only the water-lilies go
To and fro,
Dipping, dipping,
To the ripples of the water. 

As I quietly enter 
The portals of the Habitat center, 
To attend the Delhi Poetree session.
I simply cannot mention
My sense of wonder and disbelief, 
At spotting water lilies in the midst of glass and concrete.

The sight of half closed mauve flowers, 
Growing in a pool of stagnant water, 
Green serrated leaves afloat
My riveted eyes couldn’t fail to note.
Petals coming together at dusk as if in a greeting.
Perhaps, to welcome me to the meeting.

The sight filled me with ecstasy
I stood there awed by the beauty, 
Pleased and filled with serenity.

This is poetry without words, 
That can’t be heard.
But the eyes can see
And the heart can feel
And the soul can rejoice
Without hearing a voice.

The memory lingers in my mind, 
As I lie down to unwind. 

My whole life is mine, but whoever says so
will deprive me, for it is infinite.
The ripple of water, the shade of the sky
are mine; it is still the same, my life.

No desire opens me: I am full,
I never close myself with refusal-
in the rythm of my daily soul
I do not desire-I am moved;

by being moved I exert my empire,
making the dreams of night real:
into my body at the bottom of the water
I attract the beyonds of mirrors. 


glistening waters mist sparkles upon a green bed of forest moss
sunlight strikes radiant rainbow beams diamond point spectrums




I have long dreamt
Your legs so pure
 
Your eyes  -Ethereal
Like butterfly wings.

Suspended on your heart
I've crossed the pulse of life
Of all Thy people  -Stranger
Always]

As among Mine.

In the pond in the park 
all things are doubled:
Long buildings hang and 
wriggle gently. Chimneys 
are bent legs bouncing 
on clouds below. A flag 
wags like a fishhook 
down there in the sky.

The arched stone bridge 
is an eye, with underlid 
in the water. In its lens 
dip crinkled heads with hats 
that don't fall off. Dogs go by, 
barking on their backs. 
A baby, taken to feed the 
ducks, dangles upside-down, 
a pink balloon for a buoy.

Treetops deploy a haze of 
cherry bloom for roots, 
where birds coast belly-up 
in the glass bowl of a hill; 
from its bottom a bunch 
of peanut-munching children 
is suspended by their 
sneakers, waveringly.

A swan, with twin necks 
forming the figure  
steers between two dimpled 
towers doubled. Fondly 
hissing, she kisses herself, 
and all the scene is troubled:
water-windows splinter, 
tree-limbs tangle, the bridge 
folds like a fan.

   Break in the lone green hollows of the hills, 
Flame on the iron headlands of the ocean, 
   Gleam on the margin of the hurrying rills. 

Come with thy saffron diadem and scatter 
   Odours of Araby that haunt the air, 
   Spring in the yellow tresses of thy hair. 

Surely the old gods, dwellers on Olympus, 
   Under thy shining loveliness have strayed, 
Crowned with thy clusters, magical Apollo, 
   Pan with his reedy music may have played. 

Surely within thy fastness, Aphrodite, 
   She of the sea-ways, fallen from above, 
Wandered beneath thy canopy of blossom, 
   Nothing disdainful of a mortal's love. 

Aye, and Her sweet breath lingers on the wattle, 
   Aye, and Her myrtle dominates the glade, 
And with a deep and perilous enchantment 
   Melts in the heart of lover and of maid.


When, on a novel's newly printed page
 We find a maudlin eulogy of sin,
 And read of ways that harlots wander in,
And of sick souls that writhe in helpless rage;
Or when Romance, bespectacled and sage,
 Taps on her desk and bids the class begin
 To con the problems that have always been
Perplexed mankind's unhappy heritage; 

Then in what robes of honor habited
 The laureled wizard of the North appears!
Who raised Prince Charlie's cohorts from the dead,
 Made Rose's mirth and Flora's noble tears,
And formed that shining legion at whose head
 Rides Waverley, triumphant o'er the years


Moments happy moments
people think about them
people write about them
people talk about them
people hope about them
I see moments
lots of moments
but I wave to my moments
as they pass me by. 

My life is a ship 
on an Ocean deep
passing by is the ship 'Could've been'
it holds all my moments in its keep
I stand on my lifes deck
waving to moments till they're just a speck

Moments happy moments
people live them
people grab them
people make them
people savour them
but I wave to my moments
as they pass me by. 
Goodbye 'Could've been'
Goodbye moments.  

I thought that I had wavy hair
Until I shaved. Instead,
I find that I have straight hair 
And a very wavy head. 


Myth has it that the riches of the rich are good for all the people
And such a fable has got so many performances that it’s easy
To be swayed into thinking that it’s just the truth.
But when I see the eyes of the poor, aloof in their bare poverty, 
And I compare their gazes with the personal greed and moral
Shamelessness of most of the rich, I feel disgust rise inside my soul
And I feel I share the closest brotherhood with the poorest of the poor.

Will I ever describe all this? Maybe I do, but you have to listen to me: 
Don’t chase me away like ash carried off by the wind.
For this, as a novel bard, like a departing boat I’ll go
Crossing bridge after bridge, wiping away a few burning tears while
Conjuring up the face I had when I first came up.

Can you hear? Like messengers from too far away
Words wax and wane, telling of an unfair and meaningless world, 
Revealing uncanny private realities and making all my fears naked.

Novel bard, I’ll sing about life, but
Only to realize I don’t know what it means to actually save
This present time and any possible future.
Because the world has no more miracles to show 
—And it represents
The most painful betrayal. 


The Thingamabobs and the Diddleysquats, 
The Tiddleywinks and the Snickerdoodles, 
Had roasted head lice with stink-bug noodles. 
They played all day on the purple seesaw. 

Then headed on down to the Mardi Gras

Tis important to remember, 
the holy Standard that was set for us! 
Its purchase was selflessly made

Upon Calvary, this single sacrifice
completely demonstrates the truest form of Love

how Your ways are superior to our own, 
but we need to realize that we’re called
to reach towards Your Kingdom throne.

From the cruel spilling of Your Son’s royal blood, 
the ransom for Humanity was fully paid; 
and the foundation of Heaven’s eternity
has been utterly sealed and forever laid.



Dulls like a drugged pain 

Numbs 
To an ether throbbing of inaudible drums 

Unfolds 
Hush within hush until the night withholds 

Only its darkness. 
From the deep 
Dark a voice calls like a voice in sleep 

Slowly a strange name in a strange tongue. 

Among 

The sleeping listeners a sound 
As leaves stir faintly on the ground 

When snow falls from a windless sky— 
A stir A sigh



Way too soon YOU needed this lovely rose.
Way too quick went this script of a prose.
So many things were left unspoken.
So much pain and hearts so broken.
YOU needed her to sparkle in heaven's light.
on love's chest, a watch in the night
No more loving words from beautiful lips.
No more smile as the coffee she sips
Only memories in heart to be felt in the dark.
Reason as to why so soon, not ours to ask! 
For YOUR wishes are ours to fulfill.
On a morning breeze, she wafts still
though her laughter rings on moors yet
a haunting dawn, never progresses to a set
However painful it may sometimes be.
The glorious star in the night sky is she
the morning dew will be her tears
howling wind's elegy that my heart hears
still her loving voice will be my prompt
floating like parchments as silky soft
and when the sun goes down at night
darkness pierces the breast like a blight 
her love will be the power of the moon.
a friend I never knew - went too soon! 



 

Strange are the ways of life
With all its ups and downs
The wheels of fortune turns
And all of a sudden
Haves become have-nots, 
Have-nots become haves. 
But what must happen
does happen
and we have to face it all 
with courage and a steely resolve. 

Strange are the ways of life
With all its ups and downs. 
The morning alarm rings
and all of a sudden, 
Fear and anxiety threaten
to suffocate me to death.
Then I remind myself
But what must happen
does happen
and I must face it all 
with courage and a steely resolve.  

Much said and done 
Put hard efforts behind 
Still no change envisaged 
No transformation takes place 
So sign of improvement 
You may be puzzled to find out 
Where things go wrong 
You start blaming the system 
And keep nagging around 
As it is the easiest way in life 
To see yourself in the right pedestal
And visualize others on wrong line 
Paint them all with defected brush 
And unmatched colors 
You see your painting get devalued 
Without your knowledge you become an artist 
Mediocre and cheap showing your
 Own all inabilities and weakness
You are poet of your own poems 
And words come from your heart 
Heart is the center of your being 
The source of your perception 
The invisible mirror placed inside the body 
To reflect you and your mentality 
Feed it with good stuff 
Keep chanting ‘’ your desired word ‘’ 
And get quality out put 
Clean it now and then 
To have an excellent image 
Of the things you behold 
And see a huge change
 Transforming life from lower to a higher plane 
And lead a blissful life. 

call it the greenhouse effect or whatever
but it just doesn't rain like it used to.
I particularly remember the rains of the
depression era.
there wasn't any money but there was
plenty of rain.
it wouldn't rain for just a night or
a day,
it would RAIN for days and nights
and in Los Angeles the storm drains
weren't built to carry off taht much
water
and the rain came down THICK and
MEAN and
STEADY
and you HEARD it banging against
the roofs and into the ground
waterfalls of it came down
from roofs
and there was HAIL
big ROCKS OF ICE
bombing
exploding smashing into things
and the rain
just wouldn't
STOP
and all the roofs leaked-
dishpans,
cooking pots
were placed all about; 
they dripped loudly
and had to be emptied
again and
again.
the rain came up over the street curbings,
across the lawns, climbed up the steps and
entered the houses.
there were mops and bathroom towels,
and the rain often came up through the
toilets:bubbling, brown, crazy,whirling,
and all the old cars stood in the streets,
cars that had problems starting on a
sunny day,
and the jobless men stood
looking out the windows
at the old machines dying
like living things out there.
the jobless men,
failures in a failing time
were imprisoned in their houses with their
wives and children
and their
pets.
the pets refused to go out
and left their waste in
strange places.
the jobless men went mad
confined with
their once beautiful wives.
there were terrible arguments
as notices of foreclosure
fell into the mailbox.
rain and hail, cans of beans,
bread without butter; fried
eggs, boiled eggs, poached
eggs; peanut butter
sandwiches, and an invisible
chicken in every pot.
my father, never a good man
at best, beat my mother
when it rained
as I threw myself
between them,
the legs, the knees, the
screams
until they
seperated.
'I'll kill you,' I screamed
at him. 'You hit her again
and I'll kill you! '
'Get that son-of-a-bitching
kid out of here! '
'no, Henry, you stay with
your mother! '
all the households were under
seige but I believe that ours
held more terror than the
average.
and at night
as we attempted to sleep
the rains still came down
and it was in bed
in the dark
watching the moon against
the scarred window
so bravely
holding out
most of the rain,
I thought of Noah and the
Ark
and I thought, it has come
again.
we all thought
that.
and then, at once, it would
stop.
and it always seemed to
stop
around or a. 

m.,
peaceful then,
but not an exact silence
because things continued to
drip
drip
drip


and there was no smog then
and by a. 

m.
there was a
blazing yellow sunlight,
Van Gogh yellow-
crazy, blinding! 
and then
the roof drains
relieved of the rush of
water
began to expand in the warmth:
PANG! PANG! PANG! 
and everybody got up and looked outside
and there were all the lawns
still soaked
greener than green will ever
be
and there were birds
on the lawn
CHIRPING like mad,
they hadn't eaten decently
for days and nights
and they were weary of
berries
and
they waited as the worms
rose to the top,
half drowned worms.
the birds plucked them
up
and gobbled them
down; there were
blackbirds and sparrows.
the blackbirds tried to
drive the sparrows off
but the sparrows,
maddened with hunger,
smaller and quicker,
got their
due.
the men stood on their porches
smoking cigarettes,
now knowing
they'd have to go out
there
to look for that job
that probably wasn't
there, to start that car
that probably wouldn't
start.
and the once beautiful
wives
stood in their bathrooms
combing their hair,
applying makeup,
trying to put their world back
together again,
trying to forget that
awful sadness that
gripped them,
wondering what they could
fix for
breakfast.
and on the radio
we were told that
school was now
open.
and
soon
there I was
on the way to school,
massive puddles in the
street,
the sun like a new
world,
my parents back in that
house,
I arrived at my classroom
on time.
Mrs. Sorenson greeted us
with, 'we won't have our
usual recess, the grounds
are too wet.'
'AW! ' most of the boys
went.
'but we are going to do
something special at
recess,' she went on,
'and it will be
fun! '
well, we all wondered
what that would
be
and the two hour wait
seemed a long time
as Mrs. 

Sorenson
went about
teaching her
lessons.
I looked at the little
girls, they looked so
pretty and clean and
alert,
they sat still and
straight
and their hair was
beautiful
in the California
sunshine.
the the recess bells rang
and we all waited for the
fun.
then Mrs. Sorenson told us:
'now, what we are going to
do is we are going to tell
each other what we did
during the rainstorm! 
we'll begin in the front row
and go right around! 
now, Michael, you're first! . '
well, we all began to tell
our stories, Michael began
and it went on and on,
and soon we realized that
we were all lying, not
exactly lying but mostly
lying and some of the boys
began to snicker and some
of the girls began to give
them dirty looks and
Mrs. 

Sorenson said,
'all right! I demand a
modicum of silence
here! 
I am interested in what
you did
during the rainstorm
even if you
aren't! '
so we had to tell our
stories and they were
stories.
one girl said that
when the rainbow first
came
at the end of it.
only she didn't say which end.
one boy said he stuck
his fishing pole
out the window
and caught a little
fish
and fed it to his
cat.
almost everybody told
a lie.
the truth was just
too awful and
embarassing to tell.
then the bell rang
and recess was
over.
'thank you,' said Mrs.
Sorenson, 'that was very
nice.
and tomorrow the grounds
will be dry
and we will put them
to use
again.'
most of the boys
cheered
and the little girls
sat very straight and
still,
looking so pretty and
clean and
alert,
their hair beautiful in a sunshine that
the world might never see
again.
and


We all 
Breathed
That crisp air
For the crisp air that we had breathed


I know now.  that not one person can stay the same
From the looks to the attitude.  that one person has changed
They've either been beaten or tainted.  by reality
We all have. 

which is why I say
through the years not one person can stay the same
Their words, thoughts, and feelings have changed
They've either been mocked or made fun of by society
we all have. 

Through the months, not one person can stay the same
Their friends & lovers have changed 
They've either been stabbed or cut by people's games
we all have. 

Through the weeks.  not one person can stay the same
They've been having to wake up everyday 
Just to face the obstacles life brings
we all do.  


We all have
Memories that
Are always flashing back and forth
Inside of our minds


We all have obligations in life to take care
Because obligations doesn't take care of us


Neutrality is the balance
between bad and good
life is water. 
a balance between good and bad, 
we all must drink the water of life! 


Depth from depth
.. 

the pain
length from length
.. 

the struggle
mile to mile 
.. the frustration
a bitter taste
a rotten smell
a water we must drink
yet a water needed for survival

Height to height
.. 

the pleasure
reach to reach
.. 

the satisfaction
breadth to breadth
.. 

the joy
a sweet taste
a fresh smell
a water we must drink
a water oh so sweet for survival


Waters of success
sweet to the mouth
a reward to the soul
the waters of life
a journey of thirst
a well of plenty

Waters of failure
bitter to the mouth
a teacher to the listening soul
the river of death
the most bitter water of all
yet a water we must all drink
.  to satisfaction

The river runs black and rough
to the uncertain end
but certain finish
where taste is empty
smell is neutral
and realisation is simple, 
where all find and embrace, 
a moment of peace. 


We are accused of terrorism
If we dare to write about the remains of a homeland
That is scattered in pieces and in decay
In decadence and disarray
About a homeland that is searching for a place
And about a nation that no longer has a face

About a homeland that has nothing left of its great ancient verse
But that of wailing and eulogy

About a homeland that has nothing in its horizons
Of freedoms of different types and ideology

About a homeland that forbids us from buying a newspaper
Or listen to anything
About a homeland where all birds are always not allowed to sing
About a homeland that out of horror, its writers are using invisible ink

About a homeland that resembles poetry in our country
Improvised, imported, loose and of no boundaries
Of foreign tongue and soul
Detached from Man and Land, ignoring their plight as a whole

About a homeland to the negotiating table moves
Without a dignity or shoes

About a homeland
That no more has steadfast men
With only women therein


Bitterness is in our mouthsin our talkin our eyes
Will draught also plague our souls as a legacy passed to us 
from ancient times?

Our nation has nobody left, even the less glorified
No one to say 'NO' in the face of those who gave up our 
homebread and butter
Turning our colorful history into a circus

We have not a single honest poem
That has not lost its virginity in a ruler's Harem

We grew accustomed to humiliation
Then what is left of Man
If he is comfortable with that?

I search the books of history
For men of greatness to deliver us from darkness
To save our women from fires' brutality

I search for men of yesterday
But all I find is frightened cats
Fearing for their souls
From the authority of rats

Are we hit by national blindness
Or are we suffering from color blindness


We are accused of terrorism
If we refuse to perish
Under Israeli tyranny
That is hampering our unity
Our history
Our Bible and our Quran
Our prophets' land
If that is our sin and crime
Then terrorism is fine

We are accused of terrorism
If we refuse to be wiped out
By barbarians, the Mongols or the Jews
If we choose to stone the fragile security council
Which was sacked by the king of caesuras

We are accused of terrorism
If we refuse to negotiate the wolf
And reach out for a whore

America is fighting the cultures of Man
Because it lacks one
And against the civilizations because it needs one
It is a gigantic structure but without a wall

We are accused of terrorism
If we refuse current times
Where America the arrogant the mighty the rich
Became a sworn interpreter of Hebrew. 


Together we are, everything and all. 
Not destined to sulk, by the wayside fall.

Or sit all alone.
Like muted shiny stones.

The cliffs are daunting, 
not we, though, wanting.

The wind will blow soft as a breeze.
It will only manage to caress the trees.

It'll not be hot nor will it freeze.
Make us smile, not make us sneeze.

They'll sway with us, the weeds and reeds.
Spill forth the mother, her pearly beads.

The sands shall glow.
As lapping seawaters, ebb and flow.

Those gulls will hover, to guide us bye.
As on mother nature's, bosom we lie.

The salty spray will add to the taste.
As we stroll the bay, without any haste.

I'll carry some of your bags, 
tote them along, with my tattered rags.

Nothing will ever bring us down.
zipping from our city to a distant town.

Could be there, where we want to be.
From top of the cliff, far to see.

No spite shall remain in our weary heart. 
Of which we had never, wanted a part. 

What rests in memory, are decades behind.
Hand in hand, new out crops to find.

We'll thank life for whatever it taught.
And also fate for what it brought.

On our journey together, newer climbs, 
new meaning to poetry, new life to rhymes.

Soaring higher to magical lofts.
A mystical life of perfumes and softs.

Above the hills and mountain caves.
Above the wilderness and lonely raves.

Flowing the course along rivers and bays.
skipping in gold dust that forever stays. 

Liberated free, flap like eagle's wings.
Not care a fig, for them past things.

We'll not fly alone and be by our selves.
Like fist full of shekels stacked on shelves.
 
We'll say the magic mantra and those words, 
that are silently said amid necking birds.

When colors will shimmer and rainbows bend.
Our loneliness to put, to a permanent end.

Revel in the vision of a verdant swath, 
our right to tread that smoother path.



we are family, 
although we do not resemble
although i am black and you are white
although you are rich and i am poor
 
we are family, 
even though i am democrat, and you are republican
even though your ancestors are from Iraq, and mine are from Africa
even though you teach the class i'm enrolled in
 
we are family, 
although i'm a poet and you are a singer
although you are old and i am young
although i'm a gentleman and you a lady
 
we are family, 
even though i love football and you play soccer
even though you are a Sagittarius and i'm a Cancer
 
we are family, 
although i prefer rhythm and blues and you love blue grass
even though you have a car and i have a bus-to ride
although i have love and you are alone
even though you dress one way, and i dress the other
although my family loves me and yours does not know of you

 
we are family, 
you and i are family, 
me and you are family, 
no matter what the difference is
family we are, forever
because we are here, and here is earth
and earth is our home
so here, we will live, 
we are family. 


Of the many men whom I am, whom we are,
I cannot settle on a single one.
They are lost to me under the cover of clothing
They have departed for another city.


When everything seems to be set
to show me off as a man of intelligence,
the fool I keep concealed on my person
takes over my talk and occupies my mouth.

On other occasions, I am dozing in the midst
of people of some distinction,
and when I summon my courageous self,
a coward completely unknown to me
swaddles my poor skeleton
in a thousand tiny reservations.

When a stately home bursts into flames,
instead of the fireman I summon,
an arsonist bursts on the scene,
and he is I. There is nothing I can do.
What must I do to distinguish myself?
How can I put myself together?


All the books I read
lionize dazzling hero figures,
brimming with self-assurance.
I die with envy of them;
and, in films where bullets fly on the wind,
I am left in envy of the cowboys,
left admiring even the horses.

But when I call upon my DASHING BEING,
out comes the same OLD LAZY SELF,
and so I never know just WHO I AM,
nor how many I am, nor WHO WE WILL BE BEING.
I would like to be able to touch a bell
and call up my real self, the truly me,
because if I really need my proper self,
I must not allow myself to disappear.

While I am writing, I am far away;
and when I come back, I have already left.
I should like to see if the same thing happens
to other people as it does to me,
to see if as many people are as I am,
and if they seem the same way to themselves.
When this problem has been thoroughly explored,
I am going to school myself so well in things
that, when I try to explain my problems,
I shall speak, not of self, but of geography. 

Alien, UFO, wachamacallyou.

You don't live underground 
The CIA would have dug you up by now
I suppose then, you live on Mars? 
Don't laugh, this is serious
Alright, well, maybe that was stupid. 
But what I am suppose to think

Within the inception of our dreams
In the figments of our imagination
Using the creative powers of our minds
And posing some doom day scenarios
In the minds of those seeking answers
Everything comes alive! 

Lets bring out our drawing boards
And paint some pretty pictures
Wait a minute.


Pretty pictures? 
Okay, they need to be scary
And live in flying saucers
With ten to twenty eyes

A-ha! ! Now I got the formula
A mind is a terrible thing to waste! 
Lets pitch science with religion
Along with an ailing economy
What you'll have is a mix
Of those who'll accept our pictures

The more we educate our people
The smarter we will be
All the talk of creatures 
On moon, on Earth or on Mars
Can only prey on us, if we believe
We are not alone


As we live, we are transmitters of life.
And when we fail to transmit life, life fails to flow through us.

That is part of the mystery of sex, it is a flow onwards.
Sexless people transmit nothing.


And if, as we work, we can transmit life into our work,
life, still more life, rushes into us to compensate, to be ready
and we ripple with life through the days.

Even if it is a woman making an apple dumpling, or a man a stool,
if life goes into the pudding, good is the pudding
good is the stool,
content is the woman, with fresh life rippling in to her,
content is the man.

Give, and it shall be given unto you
is still the truth about life.
But giving life is not so easy.
It doesn't mean handing it out to some mean fool, or letting the living dead eat you up.
It means kindling the life-quality where it was not,
even if it's only in the whiteness of a washed pocket-handkerchief.


Politicians' say take their guns, they don't need their guns.
When the truth is America's turning back into the wild, wild, west.
We're not at our best.
Most Americans lack any morals.
We're divided by a country that quarrels.
We think of ourselves as immortals.
America needs to wake-up from your somber sleep.
And loudly protest.
We will not sit back and let you take our guns.
We will defend our sons and daughters, for generations to come.
You refused to protect our boarders, so you could usher in the votes. 
You leave us no alternative but to get out our guns.
We're not going to sit back as a nervous child that sucks their thumb.
While you, march with your private army into our homestead doors taking our guns.
Our fathers' and forefathers' fought for rights.
This isn't about color, blacks against whites.
This is simply about freedom that rings.
In which past wars were won, and a heroes' song was sung.



He will lead new grandfathers and fathers, and sons and daughters towards the  dream.
We're not a violent people.
We just want to put America back on that steeple.
That sings were proud 


We can but follow to the Sun—
As oft as He go down
He leave Ourselves a Sphere behind—
'Tis mostly—following—

We go no further with the Dust
Than to the Earthen Door—
And then the Panels are reversed—
And we behold—no more. 

Sitting in reception
at the plastic surgeon

I see a weeping
Venus de Milo

a sobbing Winged Victory
of Samothrace

and a snivelling Sphinx.


Me? I. 
am just delivering pizza. 

No longer have the nerve in me to stand
in front a loaded magnum in the hands-
of leaders who don't have a fucking clue, 
'bout leading.  

protecting me and you.


Time for change, taking charge an' pride; 
we're responsible for what we leave behind
to our children, so they'll have a chance,  
at deflecting the chaos by taking a stance. 

There's never been a better time or age, 
when so many people are on the same stage, 
with the common cause of saving life's breath-
'fore the air freezes, and *Ice Is our death.



He entertained us with his jokes
and charming personality
that's why we couldn't see
the raging sea of emotions
buried deep inside him

He always put on a brave face
when our courage was scarce
that's why we couldn't see 
the fustrations and misery
causing him to shrink into anxiety

He'd often render his shoulders
to lean on - for others
that's why we couldn't see
he was desperately in need
of someone to confide in

He also comforted those who mourn
and supported people whose joy was gone
what's why we couldn't see


whim slowly falling apart
from a broken heart


As long as he appeared to be strong
no one would guess that something was wrong
because, depression can sometimes reside
in least expected places
that is why it tends to hide
in seemingly happy and brave faces



We Cover Thee—Sweet Face—
Not that We tire of Thee—
But that Thyself fatigue of Us—
Remember—as Thou go—
We follow Thee until
Thou notice Us—no more—
And then—reluctant—turn away
To Con Thee o'er and o'er—

And blame the scanty love
We were Content to show—
Augmented—Sweet—a Hundred fold—
If Thou would'st take it—now—


I went to dance after dance in this city once, 
where the ladies and gentlemen circled hopefully
looking over the dim-lit floor for the right one; 
waiting and wondering when the music would stop.

I sometimes felt more like a spectator than a dancer, 
but that all changed at an out-of-town country dance: 
after some waltzes, foxtrots, quicksteps and line dancing, 
they had a 'ladies choice' for their own partners.


To my surprise a young  brunette walked over
to where I was seated and asked, 'Care to dance? '
We took the floor hand in hand talking  easily; 
waltzing close she said, 'Save the last dance for me'. 

They've been to the moon and back six times, no less
Got dropped off and picked up, I was impressed
For many years, I never questioned this outstanding feat
Didn't even know others thought there had been a deceit
 
But recently I started reading what the sceptics had to say
I pondered, I wondered, had we really been betrayed
The flag fluttering in the breeze, footprints etched in dry dust
Shadows at all angles, could it be explained without fuss 
 
"Mythblusterers" attempted to convince us on TV
Except on television, again, there may be tricks you can't see
Prove it on television, come on, it’s got to be done live
With investigators checking and watching that nothing’s been contrived
 
It was claimed the fluttering flag was under centripetal force
And they even proved it (on television) , I laughed myself hoarse
The footprint: that was explained using magical dust
How this powder was made, well, we were just asked to trust
 
Will Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin go to their grave
With the truth still locked inside, or could they be so brave
To become honest men and let everyone hear
That they never landed on our neighbouring sphere



We do not play on Graves—
Because there isn't Room—
Besides—it isn't even—it slants
And People come—

And put a Flower on it—
And hang their faces so—
We're fearing that their Hearts will drop—
And crush our pretty play—

And so we move as far
As Enemies—away—
Just looking round to see how far
It is—Occasionally—


We don't cry—Tim and I,
We are far too grand—
But we bolt the door tight
To prevent a friend—

Then we hide our brave face
Deep in our hand—
Not to cry—Tim and I—
We are far too grand—

Nor to dream—he and me—
Do we condescend—
We just shut our brown eye
To see to the end—

Tim—see Cottages—
But, Oh, so high!
Then—we shake—Tim and I—
And lest I—cry—

Tim—reads a little Hymn—
And we both pray—
Please, Sir, I and Tim—
Always lost the way!

We must die—by and by—
Clergymen say—
Tim—shall—if I—do—
I—too—if he—

How shall we arrange it—
Tim—was—so—shy?
I—"Tim"—and Me


We don't know how to say good-bye
We wander on, shoulder by shoulder.
Already the sun is going down.
You're moody, I am your shadow.

Let's step inside a church and watch
baptisms, marriages, masses for the dead.
Why are we different from the rest?
Outdoors again, each of us turns his head.

Or else, let's sit in the graveyard
On the trampled snow, sighing to each other.
That stick in your hand is tracing mansions
In which we shall always be together.


We dream—it is good we are dreaming—
It would hurt us—were we awake—
But since it is playing—kill us,
And we are playing—shriek—

What harm? Men die—externally—
It is a truth—of Blood—
But we—are dying in Drama—
And Drama—is never dead—

Cautious—We jar each other—
And either—open the eyes—
Lest the Phantasm—prove the Mistake—
And the livid Surprise

Cool us to Shafts of Granite—
With just an Age—and Name—
And perhaps a phrase in Egyptian—
It's prudenter—to dream—There must be, there has to be, 
what makes me special, what I should feel.
Has the world always been divided? 
Who has decided my place in the gap? 
There are the ones that care, and beloved ones, 
those suffering the misery, those of loneliness in heart.
In which part of the way the division appears? 
Are we really that apart, you and me? 


And since the spring 
of life it has been decided, 
any of you gods, 
What sense had then? 

We are all human, 
we are from different worlds.
Yet, we share the same land, 
we have the same hope
Are you really that rich? 
Am I really that poor


We flash across the level.
We thunder thro' the bridges.
We bicker down the cuttings.
We sway along the ridges.

A rush of streaming hedges,
Of jostling lights and shadows,
Of hurtling, hurrying stations,
Of racing woods and meadows.

We charge the tunnels headlong -
The blackness roars and shatters.
We crash between embankments -
The open spins and scatters.

We shake off the miles like water,
We might carry a royal ransom;
And I think of her waiting, waiting,
And long for a common hansom. 


We gain a lot when we become older.
tranquility, 
serenity, 
equanimity.
calmness, 
the ability to enjoy, 
patience, 
wisdom and foresight.


When we were children
we wanted to become older
to join with the grown-ups.

Somehow we lose this sense as years go by.
Later we want to remain young always.

But being aged gives us a lot.
We find love and emotional security
in our own self and find the meaning of life.

 


And buy cheese and bread and little jugs with
flowered labels

Everywhere is a tent where we put on our whirling 
show


A great deal has been said of the handless serpents
Which war has set loose in the gay milk of our
heads

But because you braid your hair and taste like
honey of heaven
We go together into town to buy wine and
yellow candles. 


We grow accustomed to the Dark - 
When light is put away - 
As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp
To witness her Goodbye - 

A Moment -  We uncertain step
For newness of the night - 
Then -  fit our Vision to the Dark - 
And meet the Road -  erect - 

And so of larger -  Darknesses - 
Those Evenings of the Brain - 
When not a Moon disclose a sign - 
Or Star -  come out -  within - 

The Bravest -  grope a little - 
And sometimes hit a Tree
Directly in the Forehead - 
But as they learn to see - 

Either the Darkness alters - 
Or something in the sight
Adjusts itself to Midnight - 
And Life steps almost straight. 


Beloveds, now we know that we know nothing
Now that our bright and shining star can slip away from our fingertips like a puff of summer wind

Without notice, our dear love can escape our doting embrace
Sing our songs among the stars and and walk our dances across the face of the moon

In the instant we learn that Michael is gone we know nothing
No clocks can tell our time and no oceans can rush our tides
With the abrupt absence of our treasure

Though we our many, each of us is achingly alone
Piercingly alone
Only when we confess our confusion can we remember that he was a gift to us and we did have him

He came to us from the Creator, trailing creativity in abundance
Despite the anguish of life he was sheathed in mother love and family love and survived and did more than that

He thrived with passion and compassion, humor and style
We had him
Whether we knew who he was or did not know, he was ours and we were his
We had him

Beautiful, delighting our eyes
He raked his hat slant over his brow and took a pose on his toes for all of us and we laughed and stomped our feet for him

We were enchanted with his passion because he held nothing
He gave us all he had been given



But we do know that we had him
And we are the world. 

WE have a little garden,
A garden of our own, 
And every day we water there 
The seeds that we have sown.

WE love our little garden,
And tend it with such care, 
You will not find a faced leaf
Or blighted blossom there. 


WE have been friends together,  
 In sunshine and in shade;  
Since first beneath the chestnut-trees  
 In infancy we played.  
But coldness dwells within thy heart, 
 A cloud is on thy brow;  
We have been friends together—  
 Shall a light word part us now?  
 
We have been gay together;  
 We have laugh’d at little jests; 
For the fount of hope was gushing  
 Warm and joyous in our breasts.  
But laughter now hath fled thy lip,  
 And sullen glooms thy brow;  
We have been gay together— 
 Shall a light word part us now?  
 
We have been sad together,  
 We have wept, with bitter tears,  
O’er the grass-grown graves, where slumber’d  
 The hopes of early years.
The voices which are silent there  
 Would bid thee clear thy brow;  
We have been sad together—  
 Oh! what shall part us now


The night falls, 
As though slain by the sun, 
Entwined are we, 
The salvation for which, 
You sacrifice yourself, 
Appears once, 
Bringing with it, 
A tide of hope, 
Then it withers and dies, 
Smothered by the abyss, 
Your darkened heart, 
Beats no more, 
For eternity still, 
How could you do this? 
Tear us asunder? 
Both demons and souls lost, 
Surround us, 
Wailing their pain and fear, 
Thick, red tears, fall from their eyes, 
The shine that once shined, 
Is forever gone, 
Now they are soulless, 
Their wretched crying ends, 
Bringing forth a silence, 
Thats how I know, 
Through the fog of silence, 
An entity approaches, 
Not one of good and light, 
But one of darkness and sin, 
This is what has come of us, 
Forever trapped in this place, 
This realm of darkness, 
Then it is apparent, 
That through no fault of my own, 
But because of you, 
We, 
Have Fallen


Central to the nose
Line down

Lips 
Tip the balance

Upon red 
My own settle
Build 

Internal tides 
Heave  
Flood in
Thermal swathes

Tuning intumescence


Hands firm 
Soft eyes mist
Blinding out reality
We push 
Take up the argument

Her eyes black in closure
Lashes long
Lending to 
Her sigh in song
Ups my hell


PRESENTLY

We cool

It settles me

Adrift now
 
Spirits share
An entity

Our brains
A metaphor
Of mind
Kind

A sign we know

We just 

Know


When love turns to salt
Minds are defeated
When eyes begin to cry
Hearts get broken
When joy spits sorrow
When souls have gone
When a friend is lost
After tears, we learn


We learned the Whole of Love—
The Alphabet—the Words—
A Chapter—then the mighty Book—
Then—Revelation closed—

But in Each Other's eyes
An Ignorance beheld—
Diviner than the Childhood's—
And each to each, a Child—

Attempted to expound
What Neither—understood—
Alas, that Wisdom is so large—
And Truth—so manifold


We like March, his shoes are purple,
   He is new and high;
Makes he mud for dog and peddler,
   Makes he forest dry;
Knows the adder's tongue his coming,
   And begets her spot.
Stands the sun so close and mighty
   That our minds are hot.
News is he of all the others;
   Bold it were to die
With the blue-birds buccaneering
   On his British sky. 

SO, we'll go no more a-roving	 
  So late into the night,	 
Though the heart be still as loving,	 
  And the moon be still as bright.	 
 
For the sword outwears its sheath,
  And the soul wears out the breast,	 
And the heart must pause to breathe,	 
  And love itself have rest.	 
 
Though the night was made for loving,	 
  And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving	 
  By the light of the moon.We lose—because we win—
Gamblers—recollecting which
Toss their dice again


We lying by seasand, watching yellow
And the grave sea, mock who deride
Who follow the red rivers, hollow
Alcove of words out of cicada shade,
For in this yellow grave of sand and sea
A calling for colour calls with the wind
That's grave and gay as grave and sea
Sleeping on either hand.
The lunar silences, the silent tide
Lapping the still canals, the dry tide-master
Ribbed between desert and water storm,
Should cure our ills of the water
With a one-coloured calm;
The heavenly music over the sand
Sounds with the grains as they hurry
Hiding the golden mountains and mansions
Of the grave, gay, seaside land.
Bound by a sovereign strip, we lie,
Watch yellow, wish for wind to blow away
The strata of the shore and drown red rock;
But wishes breed not, neither
Can we fend off rock arrival,
Lie watching yellow until the golden weather
Breaks, O my heart's blood, like a heart and hill. 

If ever two were one, then surely we.
If ever man were lov'd by wife, then thee.
If ever wife was happy in a man,
Compare with me, ye women, if you can.
I prize thy love more than whole Mines of gold
Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
My love is such that Rivers cannot quench,
Nor ought but love from thee give recompetence.
Thy love is such I can no way repay.
The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray. 
Then while we live, in love let's so persever
That when we live no more, we may live ever. 

we need no change
We cannot change the society
We cannot change the world
For whatever everything was born with own beauty


WE WANT CHANGE

because we have ALEADY
changed the unchanged
chained the unchained  

if changed- will be chained
if unchanged- will be unchained
 
we want to see the caged birds  fly NOW
when it was ALEADY FLYING

change made everything hostile
for this earth was ALREADY rich and fertile

We shall see these un. 

changed events evolving through  these beauties
Let Every thing be unchanged but UNCHAINED

For we don’t want ourself to change but unchained

Not to be confused here again

We need no revolution 
We need is evolution-[natural selection]

We need no solution
We need is a RESOLUTION

YES WE NEED TO CHANGE THE MIND SET[means setting the mind RIGHT]
Never mind  CHANGE IT FAST

For nothing need change is the global WAR. NING

Think of NOTHING now
Human lullabies
You need sometime to sleep
Do not think of changing sleep

For we NEED to WALK and WAKE UP tommorrow


'Inner child' may be what remains of full humanity; 
'grown-up' self being formed by systematic dissipation
of emotions that once would have lit up a healthy psyche.
Yes, the human 'maturation process' primarily consists of
learning not to feel- nurturing a numbed reaction projecting 
something we tragically call 'adult emotional stability.' 
How profoundly
and unspeakably sad. 


Long ago, when I was young, 
and what people thought
mattered to me, we prophets
were despised by everyone, 
young and old, rich and poor, 
devout or pagan. Who or what 
they were mattered as little as
a single leaf on a massive oak tree: 
they all equally despised us.
We were a sorry company, lean, 
pock-marked, smelly, weak 
to the point of fainting in a crowd, 
clinging to each other. We walked and walked.
Some of us were counting measures, 
learned the mathematics of multiple shapes, 
and applied to our work chants. Then 
a bright angel appeared among us, shining and glowing, 
he led us once again in dance, a dance 
which tightened around our bodies, 
as we assumed the angel's movements
in daylight, and only then realized
we were living angelic lives.

touch his head, again and again
we felt the touch, both gentle and firm, 
absolutely a touch of grace, 
I have been smiling ever since! 


If you need to know things which you 
will never profit from or simply enjoy, 
I will tell you of a life of service, 
interrupted by assignments and missions
and hovering around artists as they struggle
to make the marriage of Truth and Beauty
a reality on earth. And we dive deeply
into your wounded psyches, we wrestle
in that electric space of time and space, 
and feel our physical beings momentarily
expand in angelic proportions. Trust me, 
there are so many things awaiting us
once we have completed our apprenticeship, 
you will say, This Mortal Life is vexed
into a temporary glory. Oh! Oh! Everything
will unfold, open out, become a thousand times
more than itself.  and keep opening out, 
into space and time as they gradually 
become Eternity



The fisher-boys dropped sail and oar 
To grimly stand the test, 
Along that storm-swept Turkish shore, 
With miners from the west. 

The old state jealousies of yore 
Are dead as Pharaoh's sow, 
We're not State children any more -- 
We're all Australians now! 

Our six-starred flag that used to fly 
Half-shyly to the breeze, 
Unknown where older nations ply 
Their trade on foreign seas, 

Flies out to meet the morning blue 
With Vict'ry at the prow; 
For that's the flag the Sydney flew, 
The wide seas know it now! 

The mettle that a race can show 
Is proved with shot and steel, 
And now we know what nations know 
And feel what nations feel. 

The honoured graves beneath the crest 
Of Gaba Tepe hill 
May hold our bravest and our best, 
But we have brave men still. 

With all our petty quarrels done, 
Dissensions overthrown, 
We have, through what you boys have done, 
A history of our own. 


The Pool Players. 
Seven at the Golden Shovel.

We real cool. We
Left school. We

Lurk late. We
Strike straight. We

Sing sin. We
Thin gin. We

Jazz June. We
Die soon. 

I come from a musical place
Where they shoot me for my song
And my brother has been tortured
By my brother in my land.

I come from a beautiful place
Where they hate my shade of skin
They don't like the way I pray
And they ban free poetry. 

I come from a beautiful place
Where girls cannot go to school
There you are told what to believe
And even young boys must grow beards. 

I come from a great old forest
I think it is now a field
And the people I once knew
Are not there now. 

We can all be refugees
Nobody is safe,
All it takes is a mad leader
Or no rain to bring forth food,
We can all be refugees
We can all be told to go,
We can be hated by someone
For being someone. 

I come from a beautiful place
Where the valley floods each year
And each year the hurricane tells us
That we must keep moving on. 

I come from an ancient place
All my family were born there
And I would like to go there
But I really want to live. 

I come from a sunny, sandy place
Where tourists go to darken skin
And dealers like to sell guns there
I just can't tell you what's the price. 

I am told I have no country now
I am told I am a lie
I am told that modern history books
May forget my name. 

We can all be refugees
Sometimes it only takes a day,
Sometimes it only takes a handshake
Or a paper that is signed.
We all came from refugees
Nobody simply just appeared,
Nobody's here without a struggle,
And why should we live in fear
Of the weather or the troubles?
We all came here from somewhere. 

We shall enjoy it 
as for him who finds 
fault, may silliness 
and sorrow take him

We shall see
Certainly we, too, shall see
that day that has been promised to us

When these high mountains 
Of tyranny and oppression
turn to fluff and evaporate

And we oppressed 
Beneath our feet will have 
this earth shiver, shake and beat
And heads of rulers will be struck
With crackling lightening
and thunder roars.


We shall see
Certainly we, too, shall see
that day that has been promised to us

Who is invisible and visible too
Who is the seer and is seen
Who I am too
and so are you

Who I am too
and so are you

Who I am too
and so are you


We still can make it through this, 
We would have our moments, 
We would have fights, 
We still always love each other, 
Always argue over the smallest things, 
Never to stop to think that I would lose you, 
Lose you over a rumor that was started by my ex best friend, 
I never knew the truth behind those brown eyes, dirty blonde hair of yours, 
The truth was I was falling in love with you, 
We still can make up but now its too late cause you have moved on, 
But my heart, my mind, my soul hasn’t moved on, 
Never stop to think about you from all the fun memories of you, 
It feels like you are here helping me out through 
my toughest time but your not I have or need to move on 
cause you are gone forever and I know that you’ll never ever come back. 

We talk of taxes, and I call you friend; 
Well, such you are, -- but well enough we know 
How thick about us root, how rankly grow 
Those subtle weeds no man has need to tend, 
That flourish through neglect, and soon must send 
Perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow 
Our steady senses; how such matters go 
We are aware, and how such matters end. 
Yet shall be told no meagre passion here; 
With lovers such as we forevermore 
Isolde drinks the draught, and Guinevere 
Receives the Table's ruin through her door, 
Francesca, with the loud surf at her ear, 
Lets fall the coloured book upon the floor.   



We The Unencumbered

Tattered misfits, we are called, 
We ask not hate nor love; 
Survival is our handbook
Stitched with suspicion's glove.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless rove. 

Nomads of an affluent age, 
Life viewed from simple stance; 
Lacking wage or praise of skill
We use what comes of chance.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless stand. 

Exiled by necessity, 
We accept what has to be.
Yet beats a heart within us
That bleeds as others bleed.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless need. 

Pride we own, as fierce as yours, 
And devotion to a creed: 
The lux'ry of simplicity
Is what we ask and need.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless plead. 

That we your discards salvage, 
For which you have no use, 
Condemns us not as outright thieves, 
Nor do we all abuse.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless choose. 

Not to offend your conscience
Do we offend your eyes, 
Or creep beneath your city life, 
Or sleep beneath your skies.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless bide. 

Dim beneath your high-rise flats; 
Your costly tenements, 
Where order and disorder meet
In churlish arguments, 
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. We the homeless tent. 

Relieved of rent or power bill, 
No cable TV fee; 
Allotted to the crumbs that fall, 
We joy in what is free.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless spree. 

Drop-outs from affluency, 
Who own naught but ourselves; 
Senses dulled for want of tears, 
Numb for want of cause.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless pause. 

Against the angry indigo
In the profile of a storm, 
Amid our cardboard shanties
Where newsprint keeps us warm
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless scorn. 

Palates trained in preference, 
We forage as the beast.
Over-ripe, rejected scraps
Become the gleaner's feast.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless fast. 

Reclaimed costumes, dated, yet
Suited to a timeless style; 
In beauty of sufficiency
Resplendent for a while.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless smile. 

Deprived of aspirations, 
But to live as best we dare.
Ambition is, as we have seen, 
But avarice of care.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless share. 

Poverty out-witted for -
History's pages do attest -
All humans are not fitted for
Civ'lization's callousness.
. . 

We the unencumbered -
.  .. 

We the homeless rest. 

We wear the mask that grins and lies,
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--
This debt we pay to human guile;
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,
And mouth with myriad subtleties.

Why should the world be overwise,
In counting all our tears and sighs?
Nay, let them only see us, while
We wear the mask.

To thee from tortured souls arise.
We sing, but oh the clay is vile
Beneath our feet, and long the mile;
But let the world dream otherwise,
We wear the mask

We Welcome You (In Hexametre) 

O New Year, may I request you to throw some light
On why you always sneak in at the hour of midnight? 
Is it the dread of being mobbed by motley mortals, 
Pestering you to pile up presents at their portals, 
Or metamorphose to mansions, their huts with Midas' touch? 
But why should this flimsy fear frighen you so much? 

To learn how to tactfully tackle each indent, 
See the Speaker sail through 'Zero Hour' in Parliament! 
Thereafter, too, if none the wiser you become, 
Block your ears and band your eyes ere you come, 
Blindly scatter all your gifts, and lock your hands -
Bothering not at whose door which thing lands.

When HE Himself - it appears - hardly cares
What use is made, and by whom, of His own wares, 
Whoever can decry your aimless distribution? 
HIS hands alone hold the whole and sole solution.
We welcome you, O New Year; you wish us well, we know, 
Whether or not you're able to wean away our woe. 

We were born in bliss.
But in our chaos 
it gets obscured.

The soul is always in the search 
of the experience of bliss.

Bliss is the ocean.
All the other joys are tiny drops.




I longed for your lips, dreamed of their roses: 
I was hanged from the dry branch of the scaffold.
I wanted to touch your hands, their silver light: 
I was murdered in the half-light of dim lanes.

And there where you were crucified, 
so far away from my words, 
you still were beautiful: 
color kept clinging to your lips–
rapture was still vivid in your hair–
light remained silvering in your hands.

When the night of cruelty merged with the roads you had taked, 
I came as far as my feet could bring me, 
on my lips the phrase of a song, 
my heart lit up only by sorrow.
This sorrow was my testimony to your beauty–
Look! I remained a witness till the end, 
I who was killed in the darkest lanes.

It’s true– that not to reach you was fate–
but who’ll deny that to love you
was entirely in my hands? 
So why complain if these matters of desire
brought me inevitably to the execution grounds? 

Why complain? Holding up our sorrows as banners, 
new lovers will emerge
from the lanes where we were killed
and embark, in caravans, on those highways of desire.
It’s because of them that we shortened the distances of sorrow, 
it’s because of them that we went out to make the world our own, 
we who were murdered in the darkest lanes. 



Like fallen stars we will rise again, to claim what was once ours.
It may seem that all is lost, but wait, 
look behind the doors of light and truth for the memory of me.



WEAKNESS OF A STORM
The weakness of a cold stormy night, 
Made many darken dreams; 
How vain this darken life seems, 
The moon is dull as it could ever be
To such ones who dreams, 
Oh, listen to the screams, 
Why did that one talk to the evil King? 
What does all of this mean for me? 
I walked and pounder over everything, 
Through the storms of pain, 
The slaves shouldn't have gathered the stones, 
But they are very weak in darken dreams, 
The rose dust is in the air
Bring on the dark fear, 
This evil world is dull in vain, 
Lies are always being told
Hearts are being broken
Tossed at sea like a token, 
Oh, weary minds on a sunless day, 
It's a pity for the slaves to devote all their time
doing all this bad crime, 
Where religion is truly forbidden
Some found a way to keep their faith, 
In the weakness of a cold stormy night
many has lost true sight 


(For Aline) 

From what old ballad, or from what rich frame
 Did you descend to glorify the earth?
Was it from Chaucer's singing book you came?
 Or did Watteau's small brushes give you birth? 

Nothing so exquisite as that slight hand
 Could Raphael or Leonardo trace.
Nor could the poets know in Fairyland
 The changing wonder of your lyric face. 

I would possess a host of lovely things,
 But I am poor and such joys may not be.
 Sent loveliness itself to dwell with me. 

Appears this truth-
St. Francis of Assisi
Proves it, too:
Goodness becomes grandeur
Surpassing might of kings.
Halos of kindness
Brighter shine
Than crowns of gold,
And brighter
Than rich diamonds
Sparkles 
The simple dew
Of love. 

High heel shoes, fancy dress, 
Golden earrings look the best, 
Diamond rings, each finger one, 
To prove success, all is done, 

A silver Rolls, chauffeur drive, 
Fly to Paris where life's alive, 
Take a taxi one hundred miles, 
To meet the press, flashy smiles, 

Mink fur coat to wear in fall, 
Flaunting wealth to one and all, 
A thousand dollars, help the poor, 
Just to show there's still some more, 

Fifteen bedrooms to serve but one, 
Owning time and buying fun, 
Giant parties thrown at whim, 
Flash the green, attracting him

Maid to tend, beck and call, 
Clean the mess, serve the ball, 
Security for many years, 
Not satisfied, frustrated tears. 

I used an arrow to kill the spider.   
I used a steamroller to flatten the worm.   

For the ants I called in an air strike.   
Bee that found its way in through the screen:   

blowtorch.   
The mammals were easier—   

a bucket of water for submerging the cat,   
a poisoned word thrown to the dog.   

For love, only a kitchen match. That   
and a stove leaking gas   

and waiting until the dinner   
was good and burned. 

WEARING YOUR WORDS

leaving the words upon me
like a lipstick kiss.
All day I wearing your words
written all over my face.

GHOST DOG

I look up to see
the panting dog that isn’t there
only your sketching
hand scratching at the paper
bringing it to life. 


There are desires to return, to love, to not disappear, 
and there are desires to die, fought by two 
opposing waters that have never isthmused.
 
     There are desires for a great kiss that would shroud Life,
one that ends in the Africa of a fiery agony, 
a suicide! 

     There are desires to. . . 

I point my 
finger at you: 
there are desires to not have had a heart. 


bent in time, repeats himself, and passes, passes 
with the spinal column of the Universe on his back. 


     When my temples beat their lugubrious drum, 
when the dream engraved on a dagger aches me, 
there are desires to be left standing in this verse

Lost here alone, rose in hand, 
powerless await; fairy and a wand.

Like a cherub smile, in same breath cry, 
storms roar tireless, hear not me sigh.

There by you, watch the ebbing tide.
A ghost wanders moors, ever by your side.

Color of dominions, your beauty, grace.
Love's pain eternal, imbues my gloomy face.
 
Muted spring fades to a desolate bane.
Forlorn watch, suffer silent in the pain.

A beautiful flower, across the sandy spar.
Trounced my desires, in torrents that scar.
 
Sighing heave, I watch the dying day.
Call out your name in echoes that flay.

It stays just the same. Always will be so.
Live all the pain the blues and the low.
 
In forlorn days, a tear dropp ever falls, 
Lifeless I wander parks and lit malls.

A lonely heart beats, falters and stalls.
In banshee squalls, a weary seagull calls.




The strongest creature for his size 
But least equipped for combat 
That dwells beneath Australian skies 
Is Weary Will the Wombat. 

He digs his homestead underground, 
He's neither shrewd nor clever; 
For kangaroos can leap and bound 
But wombats dig forever. 

The boundary rider's netting fence 
Excites his irritation; 
It is to his untutored sense 
His pet abomination. 

And when to pass it he desires, 
Upon his task he'll centre 
And dig a hole beneath the wires 
Through which the dingoes enter. 

And when to block the hole they strain 
With logs and stones and rubble, 
Bill Wombat digs it out again 
Without the slightest trouble. 

The boundary rider bows to fate, 
Admits he's made a blunder 
And rigs a little swinging gate 
To let Bill Wombat under. 

So most contentedly he goes 
Between his haunt and burrow: 
He does the only thing he knows, 
And does it very thorough. 



Once I dipt into the future far as human eye could see,
   And I saw the Chief Forecaster, dead as any one can be--
   Dead and damned and shut in Hades as a liar from his birth,
   With a record of unreason seldome paralleled on earth.
   While I looked he reared him solemnly, that incandescent youth,
   From the coals that he'd preferred to the advantages of truth.
   He cast his eyes about him and above him; then he wrote
   On a slab of thin asbestos what I venture here to quote--
   For I read it in the rose-light of the everlasting glow:
   'Cloudy; variable winds, with local showers; cooler; snow.


   'Dot a dot dot dot a dot dot
Spotting the windowpane.

Spack a spack speck flick a flack fleck
Freckling the windowpane.

A spatter a scatter a wet cat a clatter
A splatter a rumble outside.

Umbrella umbrella umbrella umbrella
Bumbershoot barrel of rain.

Slosh a galosh slosh a galosh
Slither and slather a glide

A puddle a jump a puddle a jump
A puddle a jump puddle splosh

A juddle a pump a luddle a dump
A pudmuddle jump in and slide

Rain pours down outside my window. 
Rain pours down, inside my heart. 
Lighting fills my room, so bright
Lighting strikes me, like a knife. 

Like the storms that come and go. 
Seasons change, feelings grow. 
Like the snow that melts in Spring, 
feelings fade away on a bird, on a wing. 

Tornadoes in my stomach spiral
nerves in my body are viral. 
Until the day the storm passes- 
I'll keep looking through rose-colored glasses. 


The weather reports
there will be

humans

here
here

& 
here.

Long may
we reign

the storm clouds
laugh & bellow

peeing down

relieving
themselves

on the humans
far below

scurrying like ants
for cover.  

cover

whether the weather
is predictable or not
weather reports are


Intricate and untraceable 
weaving and interweaving,
dark strand with light:

designed, beyond
all spiderly contrivance,
to link, not to entrap:

elation, grief, joy, contrition, entwined;

shaking, changing,

forever

forming, 

transforming:

all praise,

all praise to the

great web. 

I watch her through the window 
As she weaves her web of wonder, 
Early in the morning before we're awake, 
Flowing with the silk, 
Strands stretched from without to within, 
Her feet are like a dancer's.
 Translating melody into form, 
Immersed in the music, 
She finds her healing heart. 

They leave their love-lorn haunts,
Their sigh-warm floating Eden; 
And they are mute at once,
By their past kisses chidden.

But they have kist and known
Clear things we dim by guesses-
Spirit to spirit grown:
Heaven, born in hand-caresses.
Love, fall from sheltering tresses.

And they are dumb and strange:
Bared trees bowed from each other.
Their last green interchange
What lost dreams shall discover? 
Dead, strayed, to love-strange lover. 

Irony of Ironies there is wedded bliss
The time of giving and receiving
The time to see the down-troddened, the disenfranchised

Opening presents with gleefulness
Bringing change to family systems
Whoa what a christmas

Enveloping riches, embracing harmony
Loving, hating, giving, receiving
Oh Irony of Irony

Lets celebrate the day withe gladness and joy
Gratitude and mercy
Finding unity in our family of choice


Two fluttering hearts
Sunlight gleams on a gold band
A Springtime wedding 


Each of us will mourn this ending in our own way as we come to understand the changes to come.  
Each of us, family and friends alike, will be changed as well.

Kiss those you love to confirm your love for them.

Raise a glass while I tell you stories from the past.

If you must cry, let the tears flow, but know that when this ends they go to a much better place.  

A paradise. 


Once on a plane
a woman asked me to hold her baby
and disappeared.
I figured it was safe,
our being on a plane and all.
How far could she go?
She returned one hour later,
having changed her clothes
and washed her hair.
I didn't recognize her.
By this time the baby
and I had examined
each other's necks.
We had cried a little.
I had a silver bracelet
and a watch.
Gold studs glittered
in the baby's ears.
She wore a tiny white dress
leafed with layers
like a wedding cake.
I did not want
to give her back.
The baby's curls coiled tightly
against her scalp,
another alphabet.
I read new new new.
My mother gets tired.
I'll chew your hand.
The baby left my skirt crumpled,
my lap aching.
Now I'm her secret guardian,
the little nub of dream
that rises slightly
but won't come clear.
As she grows,
as she feels ill at ease,
I'll bob my knee.
What will she forget?
Whom will she marry?
He'd better check with me.
I'll say once she flew
dressed like a cake
between two doilies of cloud.
She could slip the card into a pocket,
pull it out.
Already she knew the small finger
was funnier than the whole arm. 

We thank you for this place in which we dwell, 
for the love that unites us, 
for the peace accorded us this day, 
for the hope with which we expect the morrow, 
for the health, the work, the food, 
and the bright skies that make our lives delightful; 
for our friends in all parts of the earth. 
Amen


My wedding-ring lies in a basket 
as if at the bottom of a well. 
Nothing will come to fish it back up 
and onto my finger again. 
                   It lies 
among keys to abandoned houses, 
nails waiting to be needed and hammered 
into some wall, 
telephone numbers with no names attached, 
idle paperclips. 
          It can't be given away 
for fear of bringing ill-luck. 
          It can't be sold 
for the marriage was good in its own 
time, though that time is gone. 
          Could some artificer 
beat into it bright stones, transform it 
into a dazzling circlet no one could take 
for solemn betrothal or to make promises 
living will not let them keep? Change it 
into a simple gift I could give in friendship


Workmen lift high
The beams of the roof,
Hymenaeus!

Like Ares from sky
Comes the groom to the bride,
Hymenaeus!

Than men who must die
Stands he taller in pride,
Hymenaeus


St. John tells how, at Cana's wedding feast,
The water-pots poured wine in such amount
That by his sober count
There were a hundred gallons at the least.

It made no earthly sense, unless to show
How whatsoever love elects to bless
Brims to a sweet excess
That can without depletion overflow.

Which is to say that what love sees is true;
That this world's fullness is not made but found.
Life hungers to abound
And pour its plenty out for such as you.

Now, if your loves will lend an ear to mine,
I toast you both, good son and dear new daughter.
May you not lack for water,
And may that water smack of Cana's wine. 

By my parting of these words, 
these certain very words.
Herein because, I move it thus aside, 
of that and when from you, it is I am.
Certain muscles wrapped around inside, 
my fingers do.

The bush my hand upon is fire then ice.
Each leaf is free to move and feel, 
it feels the face is red it's buldged blue veins.
And breath sucked in the fingers roam
beneath the moon, it floats.
Does she proper beg to whom he is? 

Inside so deep those bending, elbows are.
Moans, she cries and.
Doing all of that and can't be stilled.
The beating heart when touched, feels as.
The splitting of the hips when quite, she is naught.
The chilly water vapors warm the swamp.

Blowing winds this foam up to my knees, 
his legs are never straight.
The swirling of the tidal pools, her eddies are.
Index finger, thumbed along each hidden muscled length.
It pulls it in and doing nothing, pushed.

The nerves are pointed buds around the open door, 
wheels and rings start ringing more, because.
And speaking words that never were by him, not said.

The light within your open mind it always thinking, read.
It heard them not from me and moving you they did.
Again, against between the river flowing never said.

I said to you, I am, I only can it rears the moon.
And the things that woman think they seek, some fear.

The fire my hand it burns the bush, the folded lips, 
both rings I often come too know.
Lifting up my hands you dreaming part the clouds, 
two elbows moving waves they always are. 

To my beloved! 
I lost my pen; sorry I am writing with a pencil.
Do you remember that precious day, December  
'We became oneness' you said proudly.
Isn't it? 
It's almost thirty-three years.
We have reached the thirty-third milestone, barefooted
Along this life's gravel road.
It's not a grand but a simple wedding.
I remember how I carried my old suitcase
And a soft leather wallet which hasn't contained much notes.
Most of them the invitees were gone already.
But Darling! We are still breathing.
How we faced numerous hardships together? 
We can celebrate our wedding anniversary sitting on different places in solitude.
I send a warm kiss to your Oasis from my Habitat, a lonely burning desert.
Perhaps it could be bitter or may be salty.
Please don't forget that we are not two; only oneness! 
Who knows how many milestones we have to come across? 
Not to be disheartened; let them standstill and we step out on our simplest will. 

Gray rainwater lay on the grass in the late afternoon. 
The carp lay on the bottom, resting, while dusk took shape 
in the form of the first stirrings of his hunger, 
and the trees, shorter and heavier, breathed heavily upward. 
Into this sodden, nourishing afternoon I emerged, 
partway toward a paycheck, halfway toward the weekend, 
carrying the last mail and holding above still puddles 
the books of noble ideas. Through the fervent branches, 
carried by momentary breezes of local origin, 
the palpable Sublime flickered as motes on broad leaves, 
while the Higher Good and the Greater Good contended 
as sap on the bark of the maples, and even I
was enabled to witness the truly Existential where it loitered 
famously in the shadows as if waiting for the moon. 
All this I saw in the late afternoon in the company of no one.

And of course I went back to work the next morning. Like you, 
like anyone, like the rumored angels of high office, 
like the demon foremen, the bedeviled janitors, like you, 
I returned to my job--but now there was a match-head in
 my thoughts.
In its light, the morning increasingly flamed through the window 
and, lit by nothing but mind-light, I saw that the horizon 
was an idea of the eye, gilded from within, and the sun 
the fiery consolation of our nighttimes, coming far. 
Within this expectant air, which had waited the night indoors, 
carried by--who knows?--the rhythmic jarring of brain tissue 
by footsteps, by colors visible to closed eyes, by a music 
in my head, knowledge gathered that could not last the day, 
love and error were shaken as if by the eye of a storm, 
and it would not be until quitting that such a man 
might drop his arms, that he had held up all day since the dew. 

The five old bells
Are hurrying and eagerly calling,  
Imploring, protesting  
They know, but clamorously falling  
Into gabbling incoherence, never resting,
Like spattering showers from a bursten sky-rocket dropping
In splashes of sound, endlessly, never stopping.
 
The silver moon  
That somebody has spun so high  
To settle the question, yes or no, has caught 
In the net of the night’s balloon,  
And sits with a smooth bland smile up there in the sky
Smiling at naught,  
Unless the winking star that keeps her company
Makes little jests at the bells’ insanity,
As if he knew aught!  
 
The patient Night  
Sits indifferent, hugged in her rags,  
She neither knows nor cares  
Why the old church sobs and brags;
The light distresses her eyes, and tears
Her old blue cloak, as she crouches and covers her face,
Smiling, perhaps, if we knew it, at the bells’ loud clattering disgrace.
 
The wise old trees  
Drop their leaves with a faint, sharp hiss of contempt,
While a car at the end of the street goes by with a laugh;
As by degrees  
The poor bells cease, and the Night is exempt,  
And the stars can chaff  
The ironic moon at their ease, while the dim old church
Is peopled with shadows and sounds and ghosts that lurch
In its cenotaph. 

sun kissing blue water
where kids soaking smile
jumping off diving board
wetting dinner plates
and their busy holders
having fun eating lunch

chairs bordering edges
of their deep playground
where a jolly latin sound
matching steps to a dance
groups telling stories
with laughter and delights

ferments flow to crystal
onto thirsty throat of a man
toast were raise so as voices
man behind counter cooking
tasty fish soup with veggies
hot chili and bite of tamarind

native cakes, food filled tables
line is never ending; a pit stop
i went through with rainbow mound
grin on my face; full both hands
kids came up picking on my plate
soon they will grow up like mine


Some clichty folks
don't know the facts,
posin' and preenin'
and puttin' on acts,
stretchin' their backs.

They move into condos
up over the ranks,
pawn their souls
to the local banks.
Buying big cars
they can't afford,
ridin' around town
actin' bored.


If they want to learn how to live life right
they ought to study me on Saturday night.


My job at the plant
ain't the biggest bet,
but I pay my bills
and stay out of debt.
I get my hair done
for my own self's sake,
so I don't have to pick
and I don't have to rake.

Take the church money out
and head cross town
to my friend girl's house
where we plan our round.
We meet our men and go to a joint
where the music is blue
and to the point.

Folks write about me.
They just can't see
how I work all week
at the factory.
Then get spruced up
and laugh and dance
And turn away from worry
with sassy glance.

They accuse me of livin'
from day to day,
but who are they kiddin'?
So are they.

My life ain't heaven
but it sure ain't hell.
I'm not on top
but I call it swell
if I'm able to work
and get paid right
and have the luck to be Black
on a Saturday night. 

Don't take us for the wall itself
For when the earthen plank behind the wall
Gets soaked through
We'll let the sorrow of burdonsome wetness
Flow through us

The soil sucks the trees' roots till now
Till now the sorrow of waters
hasn't reached the earthen plank behind the walls
Earth has not seen the woebegone face of the sky
The wall hasn't learnt to shed tears

Wind even now expects to blow the leaves away
Empty polythene bags sputter on roads
That never had trees planted on sides
People drink blood of their own climes
And grow like germs
Bonfire conflagrations ignite every where
Smoke has turned the flowers black
Butterflies' wings look ashen
The dream's face will bend under pressure
And break into smithereens
Let the moisture come! 
Let the clouds of pains burst! 
Let the sky's sorrow descend to the earth! 

Don't consider us the wall itself
Don't think we're but worthless
For when the earthen plank behind the  wall
Gets soaked 
We'll be there to let the sorrow
Of burdensome wetness
flow through us
Look! Our eyes do not have tears
But the mud of our dreams.


whispering palms beckoning
the gentle breeze from the shores
the echoing lap-lapping of the tides

in all this I hear a still small voice 
in muffled tones "Weep not Amuga"
for that great day is surely coming
when the world in feverish quest
for artifacts of much intrinsic value
will dredge your muddy hyacinths 
in search of a broken piece of sword
that pierced the messiah on the cross 

from the vaults of  Alexander the Great
what the Fuhrer  hid in your sandy depths
the world his remains searched in vain
but failed to look at your odd sanctuary
for what has been hidden from the wise
in the opaque suicide Fuhrerbunker 
has been revealed to the suckling
a decoy to traverse the sea to river.



A possible emotional turmoil
Our tempers have been set to boil

Shame! You blame
The very existence of my name 
For the aftermath of our fun game
I feel the same, I feel the same

Weep not, Brokenhearted
Weep! Weep! Not

You insisted you wanted only fun
Today you talk of me as if a con
Now that your heart is worn and torn

Weep not, Brokenhearted
Weep! Weep! Not

I thought fun for a couple of days 
After we’ll go our separate ways
I simply cannot understand
How I have  led you astray 


Weep not, Brokenhearted
Weep! Weep! Not

Once you sung the words to your song
I locked my heart with a key
Threw it away, so of you I would be free

I go down the street
Grotesque, without solution
With the sadness of Cyrano
And Quixote.

Redeeming
Infinite impossiblities
With the rhythm of the clock. 

I cry for parents who’re so busy
They never have any time to play
I cry for children whose childhood were 
Suppressed or spoilt or stolen away

I sob for girls who become mothers 
Long before they are really ready
I wail for boys who become fathers
Long before they can keep things steady

I shed tears for that sad little girl
Who doesn’t know the warmth of mother’s love
I howl and I bawl for that mad boy 
Whose lone father is the One above

My eyes bleed for the indignity

Cotton wool
Fluffy wadding
Cleans my wounds
White and soft
And I watch you float in the sky.
No gravity, 
When I think of my spinning head
Like a ball of Lead
That I am certain, 
Even though I drowned
Never floats in the river of life

Those endless talks of giving the fat a trim
Beauty is now the monopoly of the slim! 

Sinuous and slender
The hourglass figure
The thinner, the better.

Dieting and slimming down tricks
ofcourse selling like hot cakes

Tis a pity, I can't eat to my heart's content and desire
for rounded figures they no longer admire.

But as long as scrumptious samosas
keep frying in pans
and delicious pizzas
keep baking in 'em' ovens
it'd be hard to keep the damned calorie count
or to live in fear of the expanding waistline mount.

Ah those mouth-watering deep-fried kebabs
are entirely to blame for my yo-yo dieting! 

Gosh to cut down on cheese and butter slab
is one tough way to get rid of body flab.

This war against weight
is weighing upon my mind
instead of being simply plump and straight
I gotta maintain teen contours and curves I find! 

You do know this is a war you've got to be winning.
It's those extra pounds and not the war you have to be losing.
Or the other skinny lasses will be staring grinning.

Ah but all young ladies must as well beware
dragoness Anorexia's engulfing lair
or how her crony Bulimia too can ensnare! 

So pals better be about ill-health precautious
rather than being overly so weight-conscious. 


:)Birds are flyin' south for winter.
Here's the Weird-Bird headin' north,
Wings a-flappin', beak a-chatterin',
Cold head bobbin' back 'n' forth.
He says, 'It's not that I like ice
Or freezin' winds and snowy ground.
It's just sometimes it's kind of nice
To be the only bird in town.

'Unaware of my crime 
          they stood me in the dock. 

I was sentenced to life. . 
                           without her. 

Strange trial. 
         No judge. 
         No jury. 

I wonder who my visitors will be. 

You are most welcome
To the core of my heart.
Inside my Heart is Temple, 
Church and Mosque, 
Where all the power of
A divine power of light
Will welcome you with warmth.
Its illuminated with light
Of seven colors of rainbow.
And together they merged to form
A beautiful powerful divine light, 
Like Sun
Will flash on your eyes
And you  wont be able to take a
Glance of it.
Each rays coming out of it
So powerful
It  will pass on the power

Of wisdom, love, peace, happiness, truth, strength in you.
Melody of prayers will fill your heart.
You will feel the essence of peace and love.
And cover you with aroma of pleasant fragrance.

My heart full of powerful light, 
Light so bright that
Darkness million miles away.

Visit once to core of my heart
On return
You will feel so powerful
Like recharged with powerful divine light.

Welcome to my heart of light
With light so bright
Will fill your life with power of light! 

Welcome to my heart! 




Welcome to my life, 
The life of an ugly girl.
Filled with bitterness and strife, 
And how you'll never be valued as a pearl.

You are the devil child, 
With a face of moles, and heart so wild.
You are just way too loud, 
You don't fit in, so please get out.

You aren't local, stay away from us.
Please shut your mouth, and go back, you must.
You don't have manners at all, 
You are the reason for our downfall.

WE MUST KILL THE DEVIL CHILD, 
WITH A FACE OF MOLES AND A HEART SO WILD.
WHAT A BITCH SHE IS, WHAT A STUPID KID.
PLEASE PUT HER IN A JAR, AND SEAL THE LID.

Roses are red, violets are blue, 
This kid is the ultimate ew.
She smells so pungent like filthy old socks, 
I bet she is a dirty sow.

You selfish, green-eyed monstrous witch, 
You shameless attention seeking bitch.
You deserve a special place in hell, 
Where they rip you up, hang your organs up to sell.

You are the Creme de la Creme of hades, 
You deserve to be in the shade.
You deserve no friends and elation, 
You are the epitome of the seven deadly sins.

They look down on you, they glare at you.
Your jokes aren't funny, looks like you're insane.
Stay away, go near her at your own risk


WE MUST KILL THE DEVIL CHILD, 
WITH A FACE OF MOLES AND A HEART SO WILD.
WITH A DENSE BRAIN, AND SO OBESE
NO MAN WILL BEAR TO SEE THIS PILE OF GREASE.

Did god up there make a grave mistake? 
 To introduce me to the human race? 

But hey, I believe that they are wrong, 
They have sung the wrenched song
Of discrimination and hate
Of ignorance and immature, of late.

Those bullies out there who torment, 
I will leave you one single comment.
What cowards are you, so chicken-hearted, 
Despicable and dumb, so empty-minded.
Have you ever thought that if, 
You were the victim, how you're gonna live? 

Those who got bullied, please stand strong.
Your smile will be the one that lives long
It doesn't depend on who's laughing now, 
But it depends on who has the last laugh.
But hang in there, it will be tough.

Teens out there who wish to die, 
Please do not think your life is a lie.
For god made you a special one, 
To stand out like the midnight sun.

Let my story spur you on, 
Feeling better? Then let's move on.
For there's a future ahead so bright, 
By then, in joy, we will shout: 


'In spite of big bribes given to me, 
I understand this is just temporary.
Mindfulness! it brightens my brain.
Dare to welcome any gain.

In spite of being destroyed in soil, 
I can stand with stars in my eyes.
Mindfulness! it's my secret suit.
Dare to welcome any lose.

I understand this won't be eternally.
Mindfulness! it directs not to be vain.
Dare to welcome any fame.

In spite of lowest position, 
I can stand with brave actions.
Mindfulness! it shows how to maintain.
Dare to welcome any defame.

In spite of speaking in honor of me, 
I understand I shouldn't respond conceitedly.
Mindfulness! it's the best way to face.
Dare to welcome any praise.

In spite of gossip to me, 
I can stand without depravity.
Mindfulness! it's trump card for my aim.
Dare to welcome any blame.

In spite of typical tycoon, 
I understand all will dissolve soon.
Mindfulness! it's my fortune-calculator.
Dare to welcome any pleasure.

In spite of abysmal poverty, 
I can stand with honesty.
Mindfulness! it guides me to tame.
Dare to welcome any pain. 




The moment wraps up
the Universe in new dawn
tied up with twilight.
"How much will that be? " I ask.
"Oh this one’s on the house, Sir! "

BALANCING ON THE REDNESS


Blooms blossom.  

bell booms
sight & sound becoming one
in my open mind
butterfly balancing on
the redness of a flower.

NO HAIKU TANKA


Shadow & sunlight
chase each other over page
write their own haiku.
Who needs words when they can do
it wordless – by themselves.

LOST MOON

Red leaves on white moon
I gather both in my hands
lost in reflection.
Moon drips now between fingers
leaves on my palms – stigmata.




Galaxy of stars
as if an enormous hand
points to tiny bird
singing on top of my house
as if I hadn’t noticed.






What do you gain in this materialistic life? 
Yes, it's bigger than an ocean
But a dropp cannot swallow
Until the eyes get red a man could cry
And it's his emotional expression.
But very few understands the bitter language.
Tear! Please do not run away towards Oceans
That's the only wealth a soul collected in his lifetime. 


A courageous but disturbed poor mother has brought her daughter
A ragged doll with sunken eyes.
It's a birthday gift picked from a garbage bin
Beside a wealthy house in the town.
Oh! She cried secretly like a turtledove's cooing.


Well! thou art happy, and I feel 
That I should thus be happy too; 
For still my heart regards thy weal 
Warmly, as it was wont to do. 

Thy husband's blest — and 'twill impart 
Some pangs to view his happier lot: 
But let them pass — Oh! how my heart 
Would hate him if he loved thee not! 

When late I saw thy favourite child, 
I thought my jealous heart would break; 
But when the unconscious infant smiled, 
I kiss'd it for its mother's sake. 

I kiss'd it, — and repress'd my sighs 
Its father in its face to see;
But then it had its mother's eyes,
And they were all to love and me. 

Mary, adieu! I must away: 
While thou art blest I'll not repine; 
But near thee I can never stay; 
y~ heart would soon again be thine. 

I deem'd that time, I deem'd that pride, 
Had quench'd at length my boyish flame; 
Nor knew, till seated by thy side 
My heart in all, — save hope,— the same. 

Yet was I calm: I knew the time 
My breast would thrill before thy look; 
But now to tremble were a crime 
We met, — and not a nerve was shook. 

I saw thee gaze upon my face, 
Yet meet with no confusion there: 
One only feeling could'st thou trace; 
The sullen calmness of despair. 

Away! away! my early dream 
Remembrance never must awake: 
Oh! where is Lethe's fabled stream? 
My foolish heart, be still, or break. 


What a girl called "the dailiness of life"
(Adding an errand to your errand.  Saying,
"Since you're up . . 

" Making you a means to
A means to a means to) is well water
Pumped from an old well at the bottom of the world.
The pump you pump the water from is rusty
And hard to move and absurd, a squirrel-wheel
A sick squirrel turns slowly, through the sunny
Inexorable hours.  And yet sometimes
The wheel turns of its own weight, the rusty
Pump pumps over your sweating face the clear
Water, cold, so cold! you cup your hands
And gulp from them the dailiness of life.


So once more the cry must be. 
Duteous mourning we fulfil 
Doubt not, the last word is still 
"Victory!" 
Funeral, 
In the music round this pall, 
Solemn grief yields earth to earth; 
But what tones of solemn mirth 
In the pageant of new birth 
Rise and fall? 
For indeed, 
If our eyes were opened, 
Who shall say what escort floats 
Here, which breath nor gleam denotes,— 
Fiery horses, chariots 
Fire-footed? 
Trumpeter, 
Even thy call he may not hear; 
Long-known voice for ever past, 
Till with one more trumpet-blast 
Reach his ear. 
Multitude, 
Hold your breath in reverent mood: 
For while earth's whole kindred stand 
Mute even thus on either hand, 
This soul's labour shall be scann'd 
And found good. 
Cherubim, 
Lift ye not even now your hymn? 
Lo! once lent for human lack, 
Michael's sword is rendered back. 
Thrills not now the starry track, 
Seraphim? 
Gabriel, 
Since the gift of thine "All hail!" 
Out of Heaven no time hath brought 
Gift with fuller blessing fraught 
Than the peace which this man wrought 
Passing well. 
Be no word 
Say: "'Twas thus in His decrees 
Who Himself, the Prince of Peace, 
For His harvest's high increase 
Sent a sword." 
Veterans, 
He by whom the neck of France 
Then was given unto your heel, 
Timely sought, may lend as well 
To your sons his terrible 
Countenance. 
Waterloo! 
As the last grave must renew, 
Ere fresh death, the banshee-strain,— 
So methinks upon thy plain 
Falls some presage in the rain, 
In the dew. 
And O thou, 
Watching, with an exile's brow 
Unappeased, o'er death's dumb flood:— 
In some new heart's English blood 
Slumbers now. 
Emperor, 
Is this all thy work was for?— 
Thus to see thy self-sought aim, 
Yea thy titles, yea thy name, 
In another's shame, to shame 
Bandied o'er? 
Thy great work is but begun. 
With quick seed his end is rife 
Whose long tale of conquering strife 
Shows no triumph like his life

Things never seen or heard or written about,
Very strange, un-Welsh, utterly peculiar
Things. Oh, solid enough they seemed to touch,
Had anyone dared it. Marvellous creation,
All various shapes and sizes, and no sizes,
All new, each perfectly unlike his neighbour,
Though all came moving slowly out together.'


'Not a leg or foot among them that I saw.'
'But did these things come out in any order?'
What o'clock was it? What was the day of the week?
Who else was present? How was the weather?'
'I was coming to that. It was half-past three
On Easter Tuesday last. The sun was shining.
The Harlech Silver Band played Marchog Jesu
On thrity-seven shimmering instruments
Collecting for Caernarvon's (Fever) Hospital Fund.
The populations of Pwllheli, Criccieth,
Portmadoc, Borth, Tremadoc, Penrhyndeudraeth,
Were all assembled. Criccieth's mayor addressed them
First in good Welsh and then in fluent English,
Twisting his fingers in his chain of office,
Welcoming the things. They came out on the sand,
Not keeping time to the band, moving seaward
Silently at a snail's pace. But at last
The most odd, indescribable thing of all
Which hardly one man there could see for wonder
Did something recognizably a something.'



The bare tree there is mourning left
With all of autumn's gray bereft;
It is not what has happened me,
Think of the bare, dismantled tree.

The birds go South along the sky,
I hear their lingering, long good-bye.
Who goes reluctant from my breast?
And yet--the lone and wind-swept nest.

The mourning, pale-flowered hearse goes by,
Why does a tear come to my eye?
Is it the March rain blowing wild?
I have no dead, I know no child.

I am no widow by the bier
Of him I held supremely dear.
I have not seen the choicest one
Sink down as sinks the westering sun.

Faith unto faith have I beheld,
For me, few solemn notes have swelled;
Love bekoned me out to the dawn,
And happily I followed on.

And yet my heart goes out to them
Whose sorrow is their diadem;
The falling leaf, the crying bird,
The voice to be, all lost, unheard--

Not mine, not mine, and yet too much
The thrilling power of human touch,
While all the world looks on and scorns
I wear another's crown of thorns.

Count me a priest who understands
The glorious pain of nail-pierced hands;
Count me a comrade of the thief
Hot driven into late belief.

Oh, mother's tear, oh, father's sigh,
Oh, mourning sweetheart's last good-bye,
I yet have known no mourning save
Beside some brother's brother's grave. 

Were my bosom as false as thou deem'st it to be, 
I need not have wander'd from far Galilee; 
It was but abjuring my creed to efface 
The curse which, thou say'st, is the crime of my race. 

If the slave only sin, thou art spotless and free! 
If the Exile on earth is an Outcast on high, 
Live on in thy faith, but in mine I will die. 

I have lost for that faith more than thou canst bestow, 
In his hand is my heart and my hope - and in thine 
The land and the life which for him I resign. 

When Eduard Raban, coming along the passage, walked into the
open doorway, he saw that it was raining. It was not raining much.



The concept is interesting: to see, as though reflected
In streaming windowpanes, the look of others through
Their own eyes. A digest of their correct impressions of
Their self-analytical attitudes overlaid by your
Ghostly transparent face. You in falbalas
Of some distant but not too distant era, the cosmetics,
The shoes perfectly pointed, drifting (how long you
Have been drifting; how long I have too for that matter)
Like a bottle-imp toward a surface which can never be
         approached,
Never pierced through into the timeless energy of a present
Which would have its own opinions on these matters,
Are an epistemological snapshot of the processes
That first mentioned your name at some crowded cocktail
Party long ago, and someone (not the person addressed)
Overheard it and carried that name around in his wallet
For years as the wallet crumbled and bills slid in
And out of it. I want that information very much today,

Can't have it, and this makes me angry.
I shall use my anger to build a bridge like that
Of Avignon, on which people may dance for the feeling
Of dancing on a bridge. I shall at last see my complete face
Reflected not in the water but in the worn stone floor of my bridge.

I shall keep to myself.
I shall not repeat others' comments about me.

Fallen past the realities of a dream, 
I fall into the bosom of a sultry goddess, 
One whom's sexed aroma arouses more than thoughts, 
Crimson fingers tangle in the hair of love, 
Eyes lie there visions upon the canvas of your skin, 
These pleasures shared are godly enough to be deemed mortal, 
Your heated breath touches my lips, 
Suddenly awakened in a cold sweat, Drenched in your passions, 
Soaked to the bone with the thought of such divine sex. 

Hey_I_am kissing your face
kissing your face
kissing your face

And_I_can’t believe I am touching you there
touching you there
touching you there

And I’m not scared
But our skin is bare
And I can last all night
With this girl so fare
Go where you want
Touch where you please
And you know the right spots
When I start to squeeze
And you start to sigh
As I lye cross-eyed
Until we disconnect
It's another morning waking up wet


Whales in the skies, 
please don't tell me lies, 
I was always afraid
of your deep blue seas.

Lost in the graves of oceans, 
I could never see
What the hell was in front of me.

Just an endless blue, 
and all I could feel was you, 
and how none of this would ever do. 

They say the sea is cold, but the sea contains 
the hottest blood of all, and the wildest, the most urgent. 

All the whales in the wider deeps, hot are they, as they urge 
on and on, and dive beneath the icebergs. 
The right whales, the sperm-whales, the hammer-heads, the killers 
there they blow, there they blow, hot wild white breath out of the sea! 

And they rock, and they rock, through the sensual ageless ages 
on the depths of the seven seas, 
and through the salt they reel with drunk delight 
and in the tropics tremble they with love 
and roll with massive, strong desire, like gods. 
Then the great bull lies up against his bride 
in the blue deep of the sea 

as mountain pressing on mountain, in the zest of life: 
and out of the inward roaring of the inner red ocean of whale blood 
the long tip reaches strong, intense, like the maelstrom-tip, and comes to rest 
in the clasp and the soft, wild clutch of a she-whale's fathomless body. 

And over the bridge of the whale's strong phallus, linking the wonder of whales 
the burning archangels under the sea keep passing, back and forth, 
keep passing archangels of bliss 
from him to her, from her to him, great Cherubim 
that wait on whales in mid-ocean, suspended in the waves of the sea 
great heaven of whales in the waters, old hierarchies. 
And enormous mother whales lie dreaming suckling their whale-tender young 
and dreaming with strange whale eyes wide open in the waters of the beginning and the end. 

And bull-whales gather their women and whale-calves in a ring 
when danger threatens, on the surface of the ceaseless flood 
and range themselves like great fierce Seraphim facing the threat 
encircling their huddled monsters of love. 
and all this happiness in the sea, in the salt 
and Aphrodite is the wife of whales 
most happy, happy she! 

and Venus among the fishes skips and is a she-dolphin 
she is the gay, delighted porpoise sporting with love and the sea 
she is the female tunny-fish, round and happy among the males 
and dense with happy blood, dark rainbow bliss in the sea. 

What shall I do? 
What shall I say? 
Let's go play another day! 

What should I do? 
Where should I go? 
Maybe fastfood, hell I don't know! 

What is here? 
What is there? 
Maybe me, but we don't care? 

What

A compromise on heart? 
A compromise on soul? 
May be for anything

If not you? 
Someone else may compromise.
It works on give and take basis.
One hand give, 
Other hand take, 
Nothing for free! 
After gaining, 
Just dust your both hands and say, 
It was not I, 
It was he did it. 

I Just want to let you know, 
She understood how beautifully did this game worked.
Yeah a heartless compromise.
Where both gained something or the other! 
And blame one another in front of her.
Never you felt? 
Made others Believe.
You are Right.

This poem is from my dear neighbour. 
She wants to know. 
Can you share this compromise with your beloved ones? 

Eyes, ears, heart, mouth can be shut
Ask yourself! 
Forget it.  .
Oh Yeah! Compromise do wonders! 





She walked towards me down our street
my fluttering heart missed a beat
My throat went dry I  felt oh so shy
and my knees began to knock
She was the most beautiful thing
I had ever seen in a frock
I wanted to say " hello "but nothing came
As though my voice box had gone lame.

I was  besotted by her natural beauty
I turned as she walked past, 
she was brimming with allure
and she had an hourglass figure
Later I related the story to my friend
of the beauty I had encountered that day
he gave me a strange look and said
" Don’t you  know her? Her name is Kay."
She is not your type my dear pal
she is an assistant librarian
. and
she is a  lesbian as well


Those last words went down like a bomb
And really left me feeling quite numb.
I was devastated, shattered beyond belief
I stayed in for the rest of the week
wallowing in my grief.
I prided myself with my choice
one could see I  had taste.
But my god, what a waste, what a waste, 
what a waste. 


when a woman can bring beauty into the heart of man
she knows that she is on the right track.
for man will always try to hide the feelings
he has locked up inside.
it is an emotion he will try to deny.

but when he looks upon your face
he will know it's no disgrace
to let his feelings all unwind
and want to be with you til the end of time.

for a woman can bring out the feelings that he never knew
she can take away the sadness and heartaches 
he may have gone through.
to make him feel he can confide in you.


'this is what a woman can do'. 

As I lay amongst the long tall grass
amid wild flowers and heather, 
scent of lavender in the air
attacking all my senses.

Daydreaming lying there
soaring up on high
wings spread like an eagle
gliding, riding by.

Roving hills with snow tip mountains
patchwork fields of many colours
snaking rivers through the hills
waterfalls cascading down 

A wonderous site, oh it would be
if you and I could only see
our mother earth from up above 
see the beauty made from love. 

what i liked about e. 

e. cummings 
was that he cut away from 
the holiness of the 
word 
and with charm 
and gamble 
gave us lines 
that sliced through the 
dung. 

how it was needed! 
how we were withering 
away 
in the old 
tired 
manner. 

of course, then came all 
the e. 

e. cummings 
copyists. 
they copied him then 
as the others had 
copied Keats, Shelly, 
Swinburne, Byron, et 
al. 

but there was only 
one 



one sun. 

one moon. 

whats happending, 
as i repeat my self.
the un-answerd question.
is this the end of you and me
the bridge decaying, 
to be worth nothing.
you leave me unspoken, 
heart shatterd, 
as your killing, 
underneath my skin.
hurtting eachother.
not just me you see, 
crying every night.
just the tought of loosing you, 
my blacked circular eyes, 
bleeding through a pure
blue skylight
fighting daily, 
this cant last this why for me, 
brings back so many god damn bad memories.
thinking of breaking 
this heart, 
you and i have worked
so hard to fullfill
nothing seems right
no other man seems right.
if its my love to shows, 
its yourl ove that owes
my woe.
if our feelings 
are disapeering
this fucking sucks
but i quess this
isnt a first for me.
i really want 
to cry to make our
relationsip work. 


Many nights I lay in bed, 
Contemplating suicide, 
Wishing I were dead.

Then I think of you, 
And wonder what kinds of crazy things would you do? 
Would you commit suicide, too? 

How would that affect your mind? 
Would everything sneak up from behind, 
And eat at your soul and make you blind? 

Would you be mad and curse my name? 
Or would you be sad and give in to the pain? 
You’d probably feel helpless, 
And find there’s nothing left to gain.

I worry for you, 
Although I don’t think you do for me.
But maybe I am mistaken
And your heart truly does ache.

If I take my life away, 
Will you live another day


Husbands are things that wives have to get used to putting up with.
And with whom they breakfast with and sup with.
They interfere with the discipline of nurseries,
And forget anniversaries,
And when they have been particularly remiss
They think they can cure everything with a great big kiss,
And when you tell them about something awful they have done they just
look unbearably patient and smile a superior smile,
And think, Oh she'll get over it after a while.
And they always drink cocktails faster than they can assimilate them,
And if you look in their direction they act as if they were martyrs and
you were trying to sacrifice, or immolate them,
And when it's a question of walking five miles to play golf they are very
energetic but if it's doing anything useful around the house they are
very lethargic,
And then they tell you that women are unreasonable and don't know
anything about logic,
And they never want to get up or go to bed at the same time as you do,
And when you perform some simple common or garden rite like putting
cold cream on your face or applying a touch of lipstick they seem to
think that you are up to some kind of black magic like a priestess of Voodoo.
And they are brave and calm and cool and collected about the ailments
of the person they have promised to honor and cherish,
But the minute they get a sniffle or a stomachache of their own, why
you'd think they were about to perish,
And when you are alone with them they ignore all the minor courtesies
and as for airs and graces, they uttlerly lack them,
But when there are a lot of people around they hand you so many chairs
and ashtrays and sandwiches and butter you with such bowings and
scrapings that you want to smack them.
Husbands are indeed an irritating form of life,
And yet through some quirk of Providence most of them are really very
deeply ensconced in the affection of their wife. 


What am I but a mangled freak? 
A broken little nothing, 
What am I but a mindless geek? 
Trying to be something.

Is all of this just a little side show? 
Another person's game, 
Is all of this meant to make me grow? 
Or simply stay the same.

WHy do I feel like a worn out joke? 
A rag doll in the wind, 
Why do I feel like I have broke? 
A statue tinged. 

Oh I have but one hope left, 
Let it be my saving grace. 


The construction of a woman:
a woman is not made of flesh 
of bone and sinew 
belly and breasts, elbows and liver and toe. 
She is manufactured like a sports sedan. 
She is retooled, refitted and redesigned 
every decade. 
Cecile had been seduction itself in college. 
She wriggled through bars like a satin eel, 
her hips and ass promising, her mouth pursed 
in the dark red lipstick of desire. 

She visited in 'still wearing skirts 
tight to the knees, dark red lipstick, 
while I danced through Manhattan in mini skirt, 
lipstick pale as apricot milk, 
hair loose as a horse's mane. Oh dear, 
I thought in my superiority of the moment, 
whatever has happened to poor Cecile? 
She was out of fashion, out of the game, 
disqualified, disdained, dis- 
membered from the club of desire. 

Look at pictures in French fashion 
magazines of the h century: 
century of the ultimate lady 
fantasy wrought of silk and corseting. 
Paniers bring her hips out three feet 
each way, while the waist is pinched 
and the belly flattened under wood. 
The breasts are stuffed up and out 
offered like apples in a bowl. 
The tiny foot is encased in a slipper 
never meant for walking. 
On top is a grandiose headache: 
hair like a museum piece, daily 
ornamented with ribbons, vases, 
grottoes, mountains, frigates in full 
sail, balloons, baboons, the fancy 
of a hairdresser turned loose. 
The hats were rococo wedding cakes 
that would dim the Las Vegas strip. 
Here is a woman forced into shape 
rigid exoskeleton torturing flesh: 
a woman made of pain. 

How superior we are now: see the modern woman 
thin as a blade of scissors. 
She runs on a treadmill every morning, 
fits herself into machines of weights 
and pulleys to heave and grunt, 
an image in her mind she can never 
approximate, a body of rosy 
glass that never wrinkles, 
never grows, never fades. She 
sits at the table closing her eyes to food 
hungry, always hungry: 
a woman made of pain. 

A cat or dog approaches another, 
they sniff noses. They sniff asses. 
They bristle or lick. They fall 
in love as often as we do, 
as passionately. But they fall 
in love or lust with furry flesh, 
not hoop skirts or push up bras 
rib removal or liposuction. 
It is not for male or female dogs 
that poodles are clipped 
to topiary hedges. 

If only we could like each other raw. 
If only we could love ourselves 
like healthy babies burbling in our arms. 
If only we were not programmed and reprogrammed 
to need what is sold us. 
Why should we want to live inside ads? 
Why should we want to scourge our softness 
to straight lines like a Mondrian painting? 
Why should we punish each other with scorn 
as if to have a large ass
were worse than being greedy or mean?

When will women not be compelled
to view their bodies as science projects,
gardens to be weeded,
dogs to be trained?
When will a woman cease
to be made of pain

I wandered lonely
in a crowd

despite a host
of golden daffodils

fluttering & dancing
outside a florist's window.

I wandered lonely
in a crowd

lost now
in the beauty

lost now
without the beauty

of 
your eyes. 

The twigs to the crow
To make his nest.

What are you waiting for? 

The meandering path
Of the Ganges.

What are you waiting for? 

On caterpillars behalf
To help it become a beautiful butterfly.

What are you waiting for? 

You a cushioned butt
To sit on it and create castles in the air.




Trapped within the hundred pages so dog eared, 
I began to think that no-one wanted me? 
The top shelf of the Thrift shop was my goal, 
To pulp at the recycle yard my next week fate? 
But Glory Hallalooya, just two pounds paid.
This Liberator took me home, read me aloud, 

I wandered lonely as a cloud, that floats on high
What being in rank-old nature should earlier have that breath been
That here personal tells off these heart-song powerful peals?— 
A bush-browed, beetle-browed billow is it? 
With a south-westerly wind blustering, with a tide rolls reels 
Of crumbling, fore-foundering, thundering all-surfy seas in; seen
Únderneath, their glassy barrel, of a fairy green.
Or a jaunting vaunting vaulting assaulting trumpet telling


What bird so sings, yet so does wail,
'Tis Philomel the Nightingale;
Jug, jug, jug, tereu she cries,
And hating earth, to heaven she flies.
Ha, ha, hark, hark, the Cuckoos sing
Cuckoo, to welcome in the Spring.
Brave prick-song; who is't now we hear!
'Tis the Lark's silver lir-a-lir:
Chirrup, the Sparrow flies away;
For he fell to't ere break of day.
Ha, ha, hark hark; the Cuckoos sing
Cuckoo, to welcome in the Spring


What birds plunge through is not the intimate space,
in which you see all Forms intensified.
(In the Open, denied, you would lose yourself,
would disappear into that vastness.)

Space reaches from us and translates Things:
to become the very essence of a tree,
throw inner space around it, from that space
that lives in you. Encircle it with restraint.
It has no limits. For the first time, shaped
in your renouncing, it becomes fully tree.




I took the last
dusty piece of china
out of the barrel.
It was your gravy boat,
with a hard, brown
drop of gravy still
on the porcelain lip.
I grieved for you then
as I never had before. 

Like a wheel of fortune
Life keeps spinning 'round and 'round
Skipping chances and big wins
A lucky strike is not allowed

You might try hard to survive
To be the best and beat the rest
But in the end you'll feel the knife
Fortuna stuck right through your chest

The plans you made for future's sake
Vanish when you picture them
Overthrow the risks to make
Life as sweet as fiction can

Is there any way to know
Which way to bliss you have to go? 
So you might win this dead-end fight
And make the wrong things turn out right

What can go wrong will surely do
But if you spin the wheel once more
You'll find what can work out will too
And now you should try and challenge 
life and get the things you're looking for


Money can buy me 
food and clothes
a house, a car
and all the things 
which I can pay for
with money in my hand.
Money can even buy 
air that we breathe
that helps man to respire
when on a ventilator 
he struggles.
Money can even buy 
water which is packed in bottles
and labeled as mineral water.
Money can even buy 
vision when a cataract
is corrected by an ophthalmologist.
Money can even help 
to travel faster by Jet.
But what can money not buy? 
-a friend, a prayer 
and the last breath of life 
for these are things
that money cannot fetch 
as they have no price. 

at their best, there is gentleness in Humanity.
some understanding and, at times, acts of
courage
but all in all it is a mass, a glob that doesn't
have too much.
it is like a large animal deep in sleep and
almost nothing can awaken it.
when activated it's best at brutality,
selfishness, unjust judgments, murder. 


There's one who took my heart away.
But does she own it? I can't say.

See her as unjust though I may,
Is she a tyrant? I can't say.

She strides a bloodless battlefield
Where there's no battle-axe to wield.

She keeps a wineless banquet-hall
Where there's no bowl to raise at all.

Although she serves wine ceaselessly,
Her fingers bring no cup to me.

Her idol-carving hand is sure,
But you cannot call her Azer

When riots quiet down, why must
You brag of ousting the unjust? 

There will be nothing you can say
Of the unjust on Judgment Day.

Within the breast the secret lies
Which none can ever sermonize.

How strange a thing it is that throws
The mind askew till no one knows

How I Ghalib am no believer
But can't be called unfaithful either.



From practical perspective
Love may be viewed as colorless
When romantically reflective
Color spectrum Love does possess

To couples just discovering it’s laurels
Love is yellow like the sun shining bright
To lovers who have engaged in quarrels
Love is deep blue like a sky late at night

In eyes of lovers enjoying honeymoon precursories
Love appears red as hearts gracing valentines
To lovers working together to overcome life’s adversities
Love holds evergreen hues like cypress and pines
For lovers celebrating wedding anniversaries
Love glows gold in rings where diamond luster shines

Love can be soft and swirling 
As on paisley patterned gowns
Or calliope colors twirling
Like parades entering towns

Love’s colors can sometimes be muted
Like the softness of gray skies
Love’s vibrancy briefly diluted
Whenever a loved one dies

Where there isn’t quite enough Love
Life is pencil lines decidedly frail
Where there is total lack of Love
Life may appear as colorless and pale

Where Love is most plenteous
Life appears to be increasingly colorful
And when shared between lovers like us
Love reveals the colors, which are most beautiful


When the dark of the night 
eats the light 

The light of the night 
slivers in

To light the sea for fishes
to bite

Lovers crave the moonlight
to kiss 

Bats fly eerily past chasing
dreams

Thrown up by sleeping mammals 
snoring


What do I care, in the dreams and the languor of spring,
That my songs do not show me at all?
For they are a fragrance, and I am a flint and a fire,
I am an answer, they are only a call.

But what do I care, for love will be over so soon,
Let my heart have its say and my mind stand idly by,
For my mind is proud and strong enough to be silent,
It is my heart that makes my songs, not I.




I wish I was a grownup.
They know what they want to do.
When I get bigger than I am, 
will I know what I want too? 

I could be a teacher like Mr. Brown, 
grading papers all day long.
When little kids learn all he knows, 
then the next year, they move on.

It would be fun to be a trash man, 
dumping out the garbage cans.
I love to get real dirty
and I hate to wash my hands.

I could be a policeman 'n wear a badge, 
chasing bad guys all day long.
I could make 'em have a Time Out
for stuff they did that's wrong.

I'd really like to be a priest
'cept they'd say stuff I shouldn't hear
when I have to do confessions.

Or I could be like Daddy, 
building houses everywhere, 
but I wouldn't like to go up high
on a ladder way up there.

When you get to be a grownup, 
how do you know what you wanna be? 
I guess just for now, I'll be happy, 
being a neat little kid like me.



I want a red dress. 
I want it flimsy and cheap, 
I want it too tight, I want to wear it 
until someone tears it off me. 
I want it sleeveless and backless, 
this dress, so no one has to guess 
what's underneath. I want to walk down
the street past Thrifty's and the hardware store 
with all those keys glittering in the window, 
past Mr. and Mrs. Wong selling day-old 
donuts in their cafe, past the Guerra brothers 
slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly, 
hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders. 
I want to walk like I'm the only 
woman on earth and I can have my pick. 
I want that red dress bad.
I want it to confirm 
your worst fears about me, 
to show you how little I care about you 
or anything except what 
I want. When I find it, I'll pull that garment 
from its hanger like I'm choosing a body 
to carry me into this world, through 
the birth-cries and the love-cries too, 
and I'll wear it like bones, like skin, 
it'll be the goddamned 
dress they bury me in. 


You think that I'm an angel, 
but you're thinking of the light.
Your facts may not be wrong, 
but the truth is still not quite.

The story you've been told.
Is less than half of what you've seen.
It is better that you don't know, 
of who I am and where I've been.

The truth is an ugly thing, 
though some prefer it's gaze.
There are things that are still more palpable
when they're hidden by a haze.


The truth you may want to find, 
I'm not saying that that's wrong.
But I'm just saying I'm not sure, 
that even you are that strong.

There are things that people hide, 
things, that they put away.
Things that have reasons, 
why they never see light of day.

Though your causes may be noble, 
that I don't deny.
But there are things that are too touchy, 
for you to ever know the why.

If you play with a person's heartstrings, 
they are liable to break.
Even with your good intentions, 
there are demons you shouldn't wake. 


when you used to look at me you smiled, 
your eyes would light up and i could see how much you cared, 
now instead of looking at me, you look through me, 
as if im part of the wall. 
when you look at me, what do you see? 

when you used to hold my hand, 
you would squeeze it so i knew you were there, 
your hands were warm and alive, 
you always were there to protect me, 
now you wont hold my hand, you wont even come near me. 
when you look at me what do you see? 

when you used to hold me in your arms, i felt protected, 
your arms became restraints when i tried to fight, 
now you wouldnt even think twice about protecting me, 
youd just watch from the sidelines, 
when you look at me what do you see? 


i told you i loved you, once upon a time, 
you said you loved me too, once upon a time, 
but then something happened, i still wonder what it was, 
but it caused you to take it all back, 
i dont think ill ever understand this, 
i know that i still love you, and im asking if you do too, 
im not forcing an answer, only asking for one, 
so i'll ask one more time, 
when you look at me, what do you see


Curled up
in  a cuddle

of chat & kisses

me your naked Mister
you my naked Missus

you
the gift

making everyday

my
birthday. 


Love – is one of the most popular word anywhere
Mention the word Love in a crowd or to a group
You are sure to get their undivided attention
Love means many things to many people
He and she are in love, they are in love
What is this word they call – love? 
Do we have to sleep with each other? 
In order to demonstrate our love
Some say, not necessarily so, because
There is parental love, brotherly love
Sisterly love, and love of one’s neighbour
There are also marital love and family love 
Many say it is only sexual love that involves
Sleeping with each other or going to bed
Then, how do you define love? 
It is love that turns tears into laughter
It is love to care very much for our family
It is love to give something to the poor
It is love to be generous to beggars
It is love to help the needy and the destitute
It is love to remember the homeless
When we are about to lie down in our home
It is love to remove obstacles and impediments 
From the path of our neighbours
It is love to put ourselves in the position
Of others before we behave to them
It is love not to close our eyes or walk-away
When we see injustice been perpetrated
It is love to recognize that we human beings
Are not equally talented and gifted
By the way, what does love mean to you


What does the donkey bray about? 
What does the pig grunt through his snout? 
What does the goose mean by a hiss? 
Oh, Nurse, if you can tell me this, 
I'll give you such a kiss. 
The cockatoo calls ‘cockatoo,’ 
The magpie chatters ‘how d'ye do?’ 
The jackdaw bids me ‘go away,’ 
Cuckoo cries ‘cuckoo’ half the day: 
What do the others say


What doest ye not want me to be? Why doest thou toil so much against thee? 
What’s in thee that thou hath seen? What hath made ye so tense? 
Hide thee from the rain, bring thee into a house of dwelling.
What doest ye not want me to be? Have ye seen might and greatness and honour? 
Have ye seen thee being exalted? Have ye seen success in thine name? 
O lord, be thy guiding light and armor, for thou has planned to smite thee.
Protect thee in thy going out and coming in.
Teach thee how to overcome thy sores.
The other side hath fury in thine eyes.
What doest ye not want me to be


If you dreamt of me being successful, let me know, for it will only ease my worries.
If in your dreams you saw me marry, let me know for it will only ease my grieves.
If your dreams are of me, don’t keep it hidden, untold dreams should always be forbidden.
If when you layest down you see greatness in my life, bid me the truth for I long to be comforted.
Have you ever seen my face in your unconscious encounters, even blurry or glowingly, for I long to know what thou hast seen of me? 
Are you dreams of us, me and you strolling together on the smooth, white, sinking sand near the coastlines? 
Have you ever seen us hanging out somewhere, thus enjoying the scenery thereof? 
Have you ever dreamt a dream of me and you, even once or twice, may I ask? 
Where do your mind wander of at night? 
Do you ever ponder in your sleep? 
Have you ever experienced an inevitable imagery of me hovering within your mind? 
Have you ever long to be forever intertwined with me when you’re dead in rest? 
If yes, did you caress in your sleep? 
Do you ever cob
lay in those warm cuddly blanket thinking about me, thus swaying your feet to and fro? 
Are your dreams a torment that I’m not there anymore? 
Do you cry and lament at my absence when you’re all alone? 
What do you dream of? Let me know! 
Don’t let your dreams fade away in fear! 
Tell them to me then maybe I’ll care. 


What fields are as fragrant as your hands?
You feel how external fragrance stands
upon your stronger resistance.
Stars stand in images above.
Give me your mouth to soften, love;
ah, your hair is all in idleness.

See, I want to surround you with yourself
and the faded expectation lift
from the edges of your eyebrows;
I want, as with inner eyelids sheer,
to close for you all places which appear
by my tender caresses now.




Mood


When I was young my teachers were the old.
I gave up fire for form till I was cold.
I suffered like a metal being cast.
I went to school to age to learn the past.

Now when I am old my teachers are the young.
What can't be molded must be cracked and sprung.
I strain at lessons fit to start a suture.
I got to school to youth to learn the future. 

What fish feel,
birds feel, I don't know--
    the year ending.
 



Worthy of flowers and syrups sweet, 
O fountain of Bandusian onyx, 
To-morrow shall a goatling's bleat 
Mix with the sizz of thy carbonics.

A kid whose budding horns portend 
A life of love and war--but vainly! 
For thee his sanguine life shall end-- 
He'll spill his blood, to put it plainly.

And never shalt thou feel the heat 
That blazes in the days of sirius, 
But men shall quaff thy soda sweet, 
And girls imbibe thy drinks delirious.

Fountain whose dulcet cool I sing, 
Be thou immortal by this Ode (a 
Not wholly metricious thing), 
Bandusian fount of ice-cream soda

You go, without knowing.
undertaking a new journey, 
And from my back, silence.

Should I confess what I feel? 
Shall I keep this deep within? 
Reality without remedy, it is.

This memories, what if? 
Who is the one who understands love? 
Tender love, 
Unrequited, 
Without owner.
What for. 

Let me introduce to you
from book to book
searching for
the page where it was born,
then stops at my house, both wings wounded,
for its meals of flesh and cold phrases.

I paid dearly for the poem's visit!
My best words lie down to sleep in the nettles,
my greenest syllables dream
of a silence as young as themselves.

Offer me the horizon which no longer dares
to swim across even one book.
I will give you this sonnet in return:
in that place live the birds
signed by the ocean;
and also these exalted consonants
from which can be seen
the brain tumors of stars.

Manufacturers of equators,
to what client, to what wanderer
who knows neither how to read nor love,
that smiling predator who at each syllable
leapt for my throat?

My language is at half-mast
since my syllables
fled for safety, carrying with them,
as one carries wedding gifts,
all my spare sunrises.

like a valet who for twenty-five years
has been stealing my manuscript snows;
as much as I walk you on a leash
like a poodle
that fears to tread the dawn;
as much as I caress you,
with an equator around your neck
which devours my other images one by one,
at each breath I begin you again,
at each breath you become my epitaph.

A duel took place
between the words and their syllables.
followed by the execution of overly rich poems.
The language bled,
the last vowel surrendered.
Already the great reptiles were being conjugated.
Here is my last will and testament:
the panther which follows my alphabet
must devour it, if it turns back. 

What Saviour like to mine?
O, never let me from thee swerue,
For truly I am thine.
My thankfull mouth shall speak thy praise,
My Tongue shall talk of Thee:
On High my heart, O, doe thou raise,
For what thou'st done for me.
Goe, Worldlings, to your Vanities,
Let them help in Adversities,
And sanctefye their rods.
Your selves shall Judges bee;
I find his Love, I know his Pow'r,
A Succourer of mee.
He is not man that he should lye,
Nor son of man to vnsay;
His word he plighted hath on high,
And I shall liue for aye.
And for his sake that faithfull is,
That dy'd but now doth liue,
The first and last, that liues for aye,
Me lasting life shall giue.



Your thoughts are for the poor and weak?
Ah, no, the picturesque's your passion!
Your tongue is always in your cheek
At poverty that's not in fashion.

You like a ploughman's rugged face,
Or painted eyes in Piccadilly;
But bowler hats are commonplace,
And thread-bare tradesmen simply silly.

And still believes his Tory paper,--
You hate the anaemic fool? I thought
You loved the weak! Was that all vapour?

Ah, when you sneer, dear democrat,
At such a shiny-trousered Tory
Because he doffs his poor old hat
To what he thinks his country's glory,

To you it's just a coloured rag.
You hate the 'patriots' that bawl so.
Well, my Ulysses, there's a flag
That lifts men in Republics also.

No doubt his thoughts are cruder far;
And, where those linen folds are shaking,
Perhaps he sees a kind of star
Because his eyes are tired and aching.

Banal enough! Banal as truth!
But I'm not thinking of his banners.
I'm thinking of his pinched white youth
And your disgusting 'new art' manners.

His meek submission stirs your hate?
Better, my lad, if you're so fervent,
Turn your cold steel against the State
Instead of sneering at the servant.

He does his job. He draws his pay.
You sneer, and dine with those that pay him;
And then you write a snobbish play
For democrats, in which you play him.

Ah, yes, you like simplicity
That sucks its cheeks to make the dimple.
But this domestic bourgeoisie
You hate,--because it's all too simple.

You hate the hearth, the wife, the child,
You hate the heavens that bend above them.
Your simple folk must all run wild
Like jungle-beasts before you love them.

You own a house in Cheyne Walk,
(You say it costs three thousand fully)
Where subtle snobs can talk and talk
And play the intellectual bully.

Yes. I say 'snobs.' Are names alone
Free from all change? Your word 'Victorian'
Could bite and sting in ninety one
But now--it's deader than the saurian.

You think I live in yesterday,
Because I think your way the wrong one;
But I have hewed and ploughed my way,
And--unlike yours--it's been a long one.

I let Victoria toll her bell,
And went with Strindberg for a ride, sir.
I've fought through your own day as well,
And come out on the other side, sir,--

The further side, the morning side,
I read free verse (the Psalms) on Sunday.
But I've decided (you'll decide)
That there is room for song on Monday.

I've seen the new snob on his way,
The intellectual snob I mean, sir,
The artist snob, in book and play,
Kicking his mother round the scene, sir.

I've heard the Tories talk like fools;
And the rich fool that apes the Tory.
I've seen the shopmen break your rules

But, as for you, that liberal sneer
Reminds me of the poor old Kaiser.
He was a 'socialist,' my dear.
Well, I'm your grandson. You'll grow wiser. 

Does it worry you now? 
It did not before, 
When you did not know, 
Why now? 

What triggered your reaction? 
Who pulled the switch? 
Was it you, or society
Who condemned me? 

Did you think? 
Or was it a "reflex of training"? 
Did you do what was expected, 
What you thought was expected, 
Or just what you thought? 

Yeah, we were friends.
We used to laugh, 
At times we even cried.
Yeah, we had fun.

And we started to trust, 
We started to talk, 
You of you
And I of me.

You changed then, 
What happened? 
Was your circle broken
Was your world upset? 

What happened to us? 
What happened 
When you found out I was different
Than what you had conceived? 

Could you please explain, 
Was it all just a game, my friend, 
There inside your mind? 

You always told me "Be Myself"
You told me we were friends.
Then you flung me from your world, 
I did not fit in.
No I didn’t understand that day, 
The hate clear in your eyes, 
And I knew that we were friends no more, 
When I told you I was gay.



What have I done? 

I've beaten a poor man
into a mess
on the sidewalk
from miles away.

I am sorry.
I'll make it up to you
in next week's episode
of 'All my children'


So there are unfinished breakfasts 
paths choked by acid of accusations 
china stained grey by your bitter adieux 

fish-scale of a cold stare 
almost an ingrained ingredient 
of many our gourmet meals 

There are half finished sentences 
barbs of whose alphabets herald 
all virgin conversations and


There are missed heartbeats 
a grip of fear permanently situated 
on the neck of unformed words 

There are reasons for the dense forest 
of absurdities; there is philosophy in the 
mindless mire of our shared obstinacy 

this love we once celebrated 
If rediscovered: ravishing 
vanishing: if unobserved


What I am searching for
Is the question often I asked myself.
I am Searching for peace and
Some hope to move on in life.

The real world left me completely
shattered and depressed.
My all thoughts just ended in
Closing the chapters of my life.
I couldn't utter my pains to anyone
As there is none who can heal my wounds ever.
Let all the pains die along with me.

May be to run away from tears and pain
I started living in the world of fictions, 
Where some relief  I feel when I write
Down from my heart.
For sometime at least I feel happiness in my mind
When I engage myself in reading and writing.

I felt many times, I am living in a world of fictions

The happiness which I cannot get in real world
I started searching in stories and fictions.

The life has to move on till the end
without applying a forced break
And without taking a wrong path.

Searching for solace and seeking some happiness
I landed here.
I feel reading and writing will
increase my level of confidence
And to have a brighter view of life! 


Someone to debate me, I’ve made a decision
I came up with a theory, no one can dismiss
I’ll convince you, you’ll see I’m determined

Believe me; believe in god, mother earth, 
Or the big bang, pick your card
What’s the different what’s the race
We ain’t goin’ nowhere, facts to face

Let’s make peace, lets agree
On something we all believe in
In something we all got a feelin’
It’s black and white, it’s there in color

It fills gossip magazines; it can get you a diamond ring
You will lie, cry, change your face and get high
Low, depressed, kill yourself in the progress
It makes your world spin, it keeps you alive

You can’t deny the soul it takes control of, 
it fills the channels and the news
Its food to change our mood
We live for and die of
I believe in love, in love we trust


When One pearl came to my hand
I was happy to have it.
I was making a chain of pearls
Where each pearl is my one friend
Everyday I kept on adding pearls one by one.
And finally after many days
I thought I will just see, is my chain completed
Surprised I was
To see the pearls remained the same
How come? 
Then I saw I forgot to lock the other end.
When each time I added
Each time one pearl, I was loosing from other end.
If I had managed to keep it locked
Today my chain would have been completed.
What I lost is, I am trying to regain it.
And want to add, 
Whom I lost.
How can I loose one pearl
As every pearl is unique for me in its unique way..
I like each pearls. 
And I don't want to loose any.

Friends are my pearls. 
Each of you are my pearls.




I hate that when I cry my eyes burn so bad
Because they aren’t used to the release
I hate that when my mom talks to me, 
She acts as if we are best friends
I hate that my dad blames me for all my moms’ mistakes
I hate how my dad turns my brothers against me
I hate how when I try to help
It’s like fighting with god-
You get no where-
I hate when I want to be angry
It’s not allowed
I hate when I’m hurt I hide it
It’s like I don’t want to be heard
I hate how I feel pain makes me weak
I hate how fear brings me to my knees
I hate how I’ll never be good enough in my own eyes
I hate how I know that I’ve been lied to most of my life
I hate being right when no one believes me-
I might as well be wrong
I hate how I give up when I feel alone
I hate that when I’m tired sleep does me no good
And what I hate most of all -
Is how I never do what I should. 

What I love most
Is sleeping 
While it's raining
No, wait
What I love most
Is losing myself
In a good book
No, wait
What I love most
Is when you ask me
What I love most


I see one rose
That isn't red
A flower called my friend
One special lady
Maybe I am crazy
Nothing is sweeter
Than seeing you smile
It invigorates my life

I see a bottle of wine
With a diamond inside
That brightens my eyes
And makes me wise
Nothing is better
Than seeing you're mine
It stimulates my mind
 
I see a mountain
With an angel behind
We can't complain
I am one lucky guy
Nothing is lovelier
Seeing you on my side
It feels like paradise



Beating a dead dog with a stick
Its moments passing they will be the ones I forget
Nothing is ever remembered here
Nothing is ever savored here
It’s all this worldly death
We forgive the unforgivable and I accept; 
The unacceptable
It’s like I have no control 
And you are the control
World around me slipping through open vents
I’m releasing all the pressure before it pops
Too late the pressure has built up
Translation; we let go of what was rightfully ours
We gave into all those cliches 
Two heads was never better than my one
And the time releases again like a spinning top
But, this top don’t stop
Circles of eternity it spins
And moments of deep metal into the wood
And cool air pushes away the friction
Passing through the space 
Space fulfilling an abyss 
Looking through some glass only to lose some thoughts
Feeling the tips of your fingers and pricking them with needles
Just to see the red liquid come out
Yes, you are alive
But, the feeling is what makes you
Cause even the dead will bleed
It’s the pain of the needle pushing through your flesh
That’s what you need to feel
The pressure as the skin unwilling departs
Nothing but, pain is remembered here
Only cause in the end that what lets me feel the air I breathe



But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 


What if? 

What if we were incapable of love? 
Or to see the beauty in a snow white dove, 
What if this life simply held no joy, 
No playful shenanigans of a baby boy, 
What if in this life we had no peace? 
Just a greed to own the Golden Fleece; 
What if mankind harbored only blindness, 
No long-suffering and zero kindness; 
What if we just lived and died, 
Were never truthful, but always lied.
What if in this life there was no hope, 
Just a scaffolding and hangman’s rope
What if we possessed no goodness; 
No faithfulness nor loving-kindness
What if we spent our lives in fears
Of addicts, drunks and sexual queers, 
What if we had lived in the time of Lott, 
What if I tell you "Its now taking place, 
This world degenerates at diabolical pace"
What if Sodom and Gomorrah returns as ‘old sod’, 

What if things were different, 
What if what we desired was granted.
What if the sun did not shine.
What if the moon was raging.
What if she was there.
A soul to bare.
The states fair.
What if peace, jobs, finances came
together.
In the stormy weathers we will walk
to this lifees conclusion.
No more illusion.
Fusion, a place to stand.
The race is now on.
An Irish sunset.
Here comes the leprechaun.
A leaf clover, 
walking by the pub. 

what if i told you I Love You
what would you say? 
what if i told you i missed you
would you feel the same way? 
what if i could look into your mind
what would i find? 
would thoughts of me be there
or do you even care? 
i know i'm young 
but my heart has sung
every time i hear your name
i know it's not a game
and i do love you
with all my heart
and i do miss you 
'cuz we're so far apart
if you were to look into my mind 
only thoughts of you you'd find
what if i told you I Love You
would you feel the same way

What if I couldn’t see? 
I wouldn’t know how to be.

What if I couldn’t walk? 
I wouldn’t be able to go to the park.

What if I couldn’t smell? 
I wouldn’t know early monsoon shower smell.

What if I couldn’t feel? 
I wouldn’t even know how to heal.

What if I couldn’t taste? 
All the gourmet food would go to waste.

What if I couldn’t touch? 
I wouldn’t know love as such.

What if I couldn’t cry? 
I wouldn’t be able to let go of grief even if I try.

What if I couldn’t smile? 
I wouldn’t be able to feel light even for a while.

I can do all of these things

, These are the gifts
We realize when we are unfit.

I have really no clue
How the less privileged do.
I guess with courage and acceptance
They go on with grace. 

What if you die young
think of this situation once
what if you have less time
ahead of you to romance.

what if time is running out
for you to achieve your dream
what if days are running behind
and there is less time for you to win.

what if thousand things you have to say
in that little moment of meeting
what if she dont come again
and there is no time for waiting.

What if your poems don't get published
for you were slow in writing
what if you die a silent death
and genarations don't remember it to sing.

what if you never find your soulmate
or what if you will find and miss
what if you will not be able to please god
for deviation in your life you wished.

What if you will be penniless and
there will be no one by your deathbed
what if all will run away one by one
and even lord will not come for soul to take.

Such a scenario brings tears to my eyes
as i will lose everything in that little gifted life
only death will be my momentary companion
and therefore i will be lost in oblivion. 

What is a dream to my being, 
To justify the way it takes wing, 
And opens my eyes to seeing, 
Uplifting my soul to believing.

What is an emotion to my soul, 
To leave it feeling so whole, 
Yet depriving me of all control, 
As it reorients my visionary goal.

What is a lie to my integrity, 
To bereave me of any nobility, 
In a world where all is empty, 
Yet somehow demands morality.

What is love to my heart, 
To bind me to this art, 
Refusing me to be apart, 
From the one I knew from the start. 

It was
A
And
I lost my mom forever
On that very day

From then
Still I wait for resurrection
Whom I used to call mother Maria

A day of waiting to me


She’s a joy she’s an angel’ well that’s what she thinks
She clings on to your heart like a plug to a sink
She drives you all crazy with make believe games
 She’ll have you believe that fairies fly planes

She often comes in with imaginary friends 
And can draw on their dads with permanent pens
She has pretty parties with dolls as her mates
 But then runs straight out and she swings on the gate

She listens to stories of love and romance 
Then shoves a live frog in her best friends pants
At night when asleep the angels go quiet
 I often do think that she could start a riot

She looks like a princess all said and done 
And Uses mums lipstick to draw a big sun
All over the walls and down the settee 
Her face is alive and she giggles with glee

Its then that you have to be strong and quite firm
 For if you stand back she will never quite learn
And learn things she does most every day 
She learns how to get thing her very own way


She came into your life and captured your heart
And then from that time you won’t stay apart
You may keep your son till he finds a good wife 
But your daughters your daughter for all of her life


What is a Grandfather? 
A Friend, a confidant, and a mentor
That is what a Grandfather is.

Call him Grandfather, Grandpa, or even Pappy.
Just a thought of him and your heart is happy

A kindly face and snow-white hair
In his gentle eyes there is no disappointment
There is no despair

A whisper, a smile and secrets to share
A bond that is beyond compare

Fishing poles and bedtime stories.
Dressing as Santa, or even the Easter bunny
Hidden pockets full of money


 
Is it a child running free without a care in the world, 
With no idea of the tough times ahead. 
Is it bumping into someone in the street and knowing instantly that you love them, 
But will probably never see them again.
Is it a woman giving birth for the first time going through all that pain, 
And still loving that beautiful baby in a way in which only another mother can understand.
Is it experiencing the tsunami in person, 
While other people watch it in their homes on the news.
Is it discovering that an apple will always fall down when droped, 
Is it asking why does it fell down when dropped.
Is it dying and knowing that the person you once loved and touched is underground, 
Is it knowing that someday you will also die.
Its all of the above and many more besides, 
And being able to express it in a way that others will be able to associate with.
All of this is a poem. 

What is bitter at first is sweet in the end, 
What is sweet at first is poison in the end. 
(To everyone is given the choice)  
It all depends on the effort put in, 
and the unflagging determined will; 
For whoever strives must soon arrive at the city of his choice.

The lover's footprint in the sand
   the ten-year-old kid's bare feet
in the mud picking chili for rich growers,
not those seeking cultural or ethnic roots,
but those whose roots
have been exposed, hacked, dug up and burned
			and in those roots
			do animals burrow for warmth;
what is broken is blessed,
	not the knowledge and empty-shelled wisdom
	paraphrased from textbooks,
		not the mimicking nor plaques of distinction
		nor the ribbons and medals
but after the privileged carriage has passed
	the breeze blows traces of wheel ruts away
	and on the dust will again be the people's broken
							footprints.
	not the perfectly brick-on-brick prison
	but the shattered wall
	that announces freedom to the world,
proclaims the irascible spirit of the human
rebelling against lies, against betrayal,
against taking what is not deserved;
	our impoverished dirt roads filled with cripples,
what is broken is baptized,
	the irreverent disbeliever,
	the addict's arm seamed with needle marks
		is a thread line of a blanket
	frayed and bare from keeping the man warm.
We are all broken ornaments,
		glinting in our worn-out work gloves,
		foreclosed homes, ruined marriages,
from which shimmer our lives in their deepest truths,
blood from the wound,
				broken ornaments—
when we lost our perfection and honored our imperfect sentiments, we were
blessed.
Broken are the ghettos, barrios, trailer parks where gangs duel to death,
yet through the wretchedness a woman of sixty comes riding her rusty bicycle,
			we embrace
			we bury in our hearts,
broken ornaments, accused, hunted, finding solace and refuge
		we work, we worry, we love
		but always with compassion
		reflecting our blessings—
			in our brokenness
			thrives life, thrives light, thrives
				the essence of our strength,
					each of us a warm fragment,
					broken off from the greater
					ornament of the unseen,
					then rejoined as dust,
					to all this is. 


What is divinity if it can come
Only in silent shadows and in dreams?
Shall she not find in comforts of the sun,
In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else
In any balm or beauty of the earth,
Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven?
Divinity must live within herself:
Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow;
Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued
Elations when the forest blooms; gusty
Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights;
All pleasures and all pains, remembering
The bough of summer and the winter branch,
These are the measures destined for her soul. 

Identity is not a given; 
it is a song; it is a quest.
It is a journey and its trials, 
not just the outcome of a test.

It is the continual burning of a flame, 
not the marks that a burning  flame leaves.
It is but the choices that you wrought, 
not just the tapestry destiny weaves. 

What is Important – To whom

Neither the palaces 
Nor the heaven 
Brawl for twenty five cents
For the tendered sum 
Old man carrying a box 
on his head that too locked 
Who knows 
What is important to whom. 

What do I feel
What am I feeling
Am I even feeling
I seem to have forgotten how to feel
I've forgotten what feeling feels like
What is it like
to have a real smile
to truly feel happy
what is it like to cry
When you can't even cry
because you are so numb
that is the true sadness
Only having few ways to escape
being so alone
what is it like to have true friends
ones that don't leave
ones that stay
ones that don't abandon you
what is it like
to truly feel happy
to not fake a smile
to wake up and look in the mirror and not hate what's looking back at you
what is it like
to feel


Aggress legitimately 
I can hear screams from the back of the barns
"somebody help, someone help, call  
my daughter is bleeding".
Yvonne, cuts her wrist as she figures, 
that’s the only exit, to Hell
Her wild life has taken its toll 
Her parents were too exhumed 
with exuberant life 
They can’t afford to be back dated
I was once walking on the road 
leading to the Police precinct 
when I saw a lady was robbed, 
shot and no ones around 
rendered a helping hand
She’s bleeding to death 
before I could call the ambulance
Life could be pleasant all the way for some
It’s like walking in the middle of the park
You feel free to embrace the crouch air 
It goes deep into your system
Feel like you were born again 
The smile on your face 
Paints a little episode of your past

Amid the moon shines on a musing night 
The time when lust and passion
Impregnate many dwellers and lovers 
Not far below the cold mountain
A stricken two floors ranch house 
Were hosting demise session
The mother of three was metastasized 
by carcinoma
It’s a grieving time for some 
Regardless of where you live
They say life is like a box of chocolate
It’s easy said than done
You love someone and are loved 
The mutual is beautiful 
But the condition could deteriorate 
Heart breaks which could be a precursor to death
The stout politician once said 
"today’s world is all about money, 
it’s the root of success and last but not least, evil"

Yes, it's money matters
No money no talk 
The infamous phrases
In some region of the world 
There’s no longer a democracy 
But monecracy
Which is obviously money craze? 
Millions of lives perished like ashes, 
strewn all over the mourning ocean, 
at the hands of politicians
Well, we live by seconds, minutes and hours
The clock is ticking
When the eyes blinking
Another life will succumb 
Life is like walking in the middle of the park
You don’t leave anything behind 
Unless you want to call it a day

So, what’s life

ok, let us talk about life

my cat Kuting has just given birth
to three kittens
she must have loved their fathers
too much
three for i love you

the bitch in the house is pregnant again
we are sad
she is having a relationship with a native
dog
the one that takes trash for breakfast
no definite master
and house
a vagabond
she loves

i think and that is what we too believe
a cat has nine lives
and with her three kittens she gets
an extended twenty-seven lives

wow, that is amazing
cats indeed know how to live a longer time
than us
people who is into
birth controls

life is an early morning tea
a view from the veranda to the sea
a sunrise
a run to take the dip of the salt of the sea
closing your eyes
and see everything that this world is offering

life is a march of the ants
keeping an empire stable
to ensure a birth of a hundred or more
soldiers

life is what we are here for
who thinks about death tomorrow? Nobody. 

I resent
What loss represents
I resent
What great loss presents


So what’s the fuss about loss? 

Waiting! 
Debating! 
Contemplating! 

What is loss? 
Something you care about
Taken away from you by force
Creating total unforgivable chaos

Thinking! 
Blinking! 
Seeking! 

What is loss
It is a minus instead of a plus
Hence the unmistakable fuss
Death and sickness build up great grief
Loss brings despair instead of relief
And in loss itself I have no belief

I resent
What loss represents
I resent
What great loss presents

Loss! An inequitable cause
Thrown on you without a toss
So you become very cross
Because in your life you realize, you are never the only boss! 


encounters? Is love a feeling 
which someone can handle? Is 
love a reaction that everyone 
must balance? Is love a reaction 
which someone need perhaps? Is 
love lust or someone's imbalance? 
Is love pain or everyone's shame? 
Is love abusive? I think not; It 
should not lead anyone to harbor 
doubt. Love will be what you  
make it; And it won't collapse. 
Love is really your point of view 
perhaps. Is love enhanced or is 
love a tender advance? Is it 
love at all? If you have to ask, 
explain or demand, I think not; 
True love is joy, hope, peace, 
and faith in man. So love will  
always be what you make it I see; 
or perhaps what it should be. A 
beautiful reaction between two 
people happily; I hope you all see. 


What is Love? 
Is it a folly, 
Is it mirth, or melancholy? 
    Joys above, 
Are there many, or not any? 
    What is Love? 

    If you please, 
A most sweet folly! 
Full of mirth and melancholy: 
    Both of these! 
In its sadness worth all gladness, 
    If you please! 

    Prithee where, 
Goes Love a-hiding? 
Is he long in his abiding 
    Anywhere? 
Can you bind him when you find him; 
    Prithee, where? 

    With spring days 
Love comes and dallies: 
Upon the mountains, through the valleys 
    Lie Love's ways. 
Then he leaves you and deceives you 
    In spring days. 


Some say it destroys a soul  
 Some say bogus, some say pure.
Some say it's a disease, has no cure 
 Some want pleasure, some want fame.
Some say frankly it's a good game.
Some are happy, some are sad, 
Some are in jail, some are mad.


Some make cry, some do fight.
Some are in dark, some are in light.
Some become poor, some become rich
Some lose their sleep, some gets peace.
Some get heaven, some get hell
Panacea or pain - cannot tell.

What is love
A false view pulled over our eyes
A feeling that means nothing
A once good thought turned evil
A lustfulness gift
A bad experience
A lonely night
Or Is love the feeling you get when you know nothing can go wrong


The understanding
Between purity and impurity
Development of mental faculty
After doing wrong feeling guilty
Understanding reactions of actions
Of own and others actions
Some attain maturity at young age
Some attain after some stage
A phase of social change
Through ideas exchange
Easy access to information
Increased social interaction
One can attain maturity
With ease and not difficulty
The age bar for maturity
Defined in civil code
For awarding one to be guilty
Sometimes proves to be faulty
One who studies in urban schools
May attain maturity at early age
While one studying in rural schools
One who is uneducated may attain
May attain maturity after a detain
Maturity is not a matter of age
It is a stage of social changing phase


Music is freedom that relentlessly exists
Freedom of speech
Freedom of thought
Freedom of creativity
Freedom of imagination

Music is ever soothingly healing
A bombardment of on-going expression of feelings
Music is a tool of unity
Always bringing people together as family
Hence be described as a mentor of spirituality

Music is magic
Performing its tricks 
With sweet instrumental tones and lyrics

Music is emotionally captivating
Music is positively distracting
Music is a form of beautiful art
Passed on as a message on a public stage

Music is as powerful as water
Flowing in and out of generations
Trapped ever so often only by its own enormous power

Music is an angel
Singing out from the skies as she flies
Music is love
Music is the food of all moods
Music is perfect and it is good for you

What is your destiny? 
Can it be changed at all? 
Or is it another hallucination
A figment of our imagination, 
of what life should hold in stock for us

If destiny would walk our paths
I would say to destiny
Why have you come all this way, just to lead us astray? 

Is poem  umbrageous deluding alley ? 
Heart is pitcher; colurful foam erupts 
Zero essence multiform infinite essay. 


What is poetry? 
I say it is mega-magnetic fun
When words play and tend to run
It is mega-magnetic fun
Yes mega-magnetic fun

When readers show they are appreciative
Of playful words which are narrative
I say it is mega-magnetic fun

When readers have come & gone
And all the votes have been cast and drawn
I say it is mega-magnetic fun

When writers become inventive
With or without any material incentive
I say it is mega-magnetic fun

That is what poetry is about
It is mega-magnetic fun


Purple is happiness.
Purple is home. 
Purple is a sanctuary.
And Purple is my own.
A little place in my mind.
A little sunshine in my day.
Purple is who I am.
And Purple is magic. 


What is red, what is black
Whatever I gain easily, that is red to me
Whatever  I don’t, that is black  to me
I   h’ve come here, that is red 
One day   I  will depart, that will be black
Sometimes on the path of red
Sometimes on the path of black we all stroll.
One and all become perturbed
With  the sweet smell of you name. 


Money we all know is a medium of exchange
Buyers and sellers relate to each other through money
The question here is – what is the value of money? 
Few say money is the root of all evil
Many say money is the root of prosperity
And how valuable is money
Almost everything is measured by money
People go to work everyday because of money
Wealth of individuals is measured by money
All purchases and transactions are made by money
Every country has a name for its own money
The importance of some countries
In based on the value of their money
What is the value of money? 
The rise and fall of foreign exchange
Is used to measure the value of money
Success to many is also measured by money
Corporate positions are measured by money
There are some people who marry for money
What is the value of money? 
To many, money is everything
You cannot get many things done without money
Many have pondered and contemplated to ask
Can human beings live without money? 
Then, how shall we determine and decide
The prices of individuals and materials
Differences between the rich and the poor
Are calculated in monetary terms
The power bestowed by money
Seems bigger than imagined


What is this
this is your dream. 
this is your path.
this is your joy.

Some love a winter’s walk
Too many others love to talk
Most of us love a classic movie
Love to do things considered groovy

We love our spouse and love our mothers
We love our sisters and of course our brothers
Love the songs Sinatra sings
We seem to love all manner of things

Some love to smoke and love to drink
Love to receive a flirtatious wink
In our love-smitten society
Emotional love has much variety

So I’ve come to my loving conclusion
The meaning of love is pure confusion


T - Truth
R - Respect
U - Unity
S - Sincerity
T - Togetherness


A childish mind
Innocent so pure? 
A loving heart
Caring so more? 
An affectionate wife
Selfless round the clock? 
A fertile woman
Proving man's fertility? 
An efficient economist
Money saving? 
An all round housekeeper
Whirling like top? 
A one sided lover
Gifting alone? 
Wanted is 
A flawless 
Sand glass figure
Ever fresh to eyes
Holding the topmost
Position with a 
Six digit salary 
Yet at their disposal
Round the clock
Maintaining the 
House speckless
Repeating not dishes
Providing multi cuisine food
Baby sitting tutor
Ever satisfying whore
Demanding not 
Money even for 
Medical expenses
With zero maintenance 
For beautifying too..
A robot with no 
Feelings and senses
Tolerating even
Hardcore flirting
As male  birth rights
Doomed as paranoid
Or jealous whilst
Similar of their 
Such feeling is
Termed possesiveess
Wanted is an
Ever beautiful 
Multicuisine chef
Swirling as top
Tirelessly ever
To the threads 
In their hands
Satisfying their
Every appetite. 
Nothing wrong is 
Thus with you my dear
But with the
Half brained 
So called better halves! 
Perfect are you
When your love 
For yourself 
Exceeds that of
Yours for others! 
Love yourself
As thy lover! 




What is worship? Who are this man
and this woman bringing flowers?

What kinds of flowers should be brought,
and what streamwater poured over the images?

Real worship is done by the mind
(Let that be a man) and by the desire
(Let that be a woman). And let those two
choose what to sacrifice.

There is a liquid that can be released
from under the mask of the face,
a nectar which when it rushes down
gives discipline and strength.

Let that be your sacred pouring,
Let your worship song be silence.



to lean lovingly against the edge
of the body's resistance

to float on the river of awareness
beneath the thinking mind

to follow the music of the heart
beyond the ear's hearing

to touch the pillow between 
the in-breath and the out-breath

to delight in the bliss
of being gloriously present


Have you ever met any human being 
Who does not know their sign of the zodiac? 
We all pretend not to believe in astrology
Yet, we all know our astrological signs
What is your sign? We ask each other
Whenever many of us buy newspapers
The first thing we read is the horoscope section
Do the zodiac signs influence our destiny? 
Are we puppets been manipulated by the stars? 
Do the stars above determine our happiness? 
Do our birthdates decide our fate on earth? 
Then, how come twins born on the same day
Have different destinies and lifestyles? 
Do you credit your success to your birthdate? 
Or blame your failure on your astrological sign? 
People born under the same zodiac sign
Are said to possess similar characteristics
It is also said that our zodiac sign determines
Our compatibility with other fellows
Whether this is true or not, in most cases
We still decide who is or will be our wife, partner
Husband, spouse, soul-mate or companion
If we end up making an erroneous decision
And our relationship end up in a divorce court
Shall we blame astrological incompatibility? 
Or blame our shortsightedness and all the stars above
Many believe that astrology can compute probabilities
Therefore, nothing is carved in stone or infallible
All things been equal, it is worth looking into
Enjoy your life, good luck and happy destiny


What it really is
I cannot tell
I don't know
What is bothering me
And what is blocking my view
But I want to hang on tight
And
Give myself another chance
To study life
So I can learn to
Stay afloat in rough waters
And
Survive 
Even when life curles inward


And I shall

never know

of sorrow, 


I will

never hurt

from pain, 

never dream, of my tommorrows, 
never care what comes today.

I will never know
you loved me, 
I will 
never hear your name! 

Only the whisper 
of the willow, 
that cries above my grave


What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and why, 
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain 
Under my head till morning; but the rain 
Is full of ghosts tonight, that tap and sigh 
Upon the glass and listen for reply, 
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain 
For unremembered lads that not again 
Will turn to me at midnight with a cry. 
Thus in winter stands the lonely tree, 
Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one, 
Yet knows its boughs more silent than before: 
I cannot say what loves have come and gone, 
I only know that summer sang in me 
A little while, that in me sings no more.


What little is left of being
kind

Place it in a box with some
orchids 

Send it to those who are starving
in those camps

Forgotten about by those who have food, 
a home, and more money than more

what little is left of the dignity of
those who don't care

About fellow humans in dire straits, 
but care more about their faith

Put it in a box with roses, and send 
it off to those who have dignity

In their poverty, and face their fate
with strength, athough hungry


What is it that we’re told? 
That love is a feeling, 
That love is something to hold, 
That love is heart beating? 

What is it that we’re told? 
That love is what’s right, 
That love burns hot, not cold, 
That love is passion in night? 

What is it that we’re told? 
That love is burning desire, 
That any can fit in the mold, 
That love is a raging fire? 

Well, here is what it is, 
Love is a choice.
Choosing to cherish
And always to rejoice


In this beautiful landscape of life
Where we share our laughter and cries
And all our sorrows and unbearable tries

Where love flows boundlessly and for long
Where we all learn to sing the same song
And hold our hands firmly together
In all fair, snowy or stormy weather

Where amazing spring flowers bloom forever
And your family lets you down never
For they are always there without being mean
And lend their strong shoulders to lean

Where mom and dad, brothers and sis
Are always there and they never miss
Any opportunity to hug or kiss to heal
Your inflicting pain in life's deal

That is what makes a family so special dear
Where magic and miracles flow uninterrupted in layers
Without which no soul can experience a lift

For with them we share our laughter and cries
And all our sorrows and unbearable tries
And we hold our hands firmly together
In all fair, snowy or stormy weather.



A friend
Is someone that everyone needs
A friend
Is that special one 
A friend 
Is someone you tell EVERYTHING
A friend
Is someone you never lie to
A friend
Can be a boy or a girl
A friend
Is someone that is always their
A friend
Will always listen to you
A friend 
Always has input to give
A friend 
Will never leave you in the dust
A friend
Will help you through the thick and the thin
A friend
Will always stand by your side
A friend 
Will never let you down
A friend


Is someone everyone needs
What would you do if you didnt have a friend

Whispers of her soul and love in her heart
Smiles on her lips and tears that start

Courage that she shows and Kindness that she spreads
Playing with her children and baking cookies and breads

Taking kids to school and driving them around
Shopping for the loved ones in life's merry-go-round

Doing somersaults and planting flowers in Spring
Folding clean laundry and spinning around love's ring

Holding hands in pang and lending her shoulders to lean
Wiping falling tears and listening problems with keen

Helping everyone to finish their task with care
And as the day unfolds spread kindness, love and cheer

These are a few things that makes a woman strong
And in every life's step she brings happiness along

For her tenderness and kindness give a fresh start
That she wraps up at day's end with prayers in her heart.



or stand, 
could it be the way i talk, 
the glasses on my face, 
the way my face is, 
my eyes or nose or lips or ears
and smile that make my face, 
my height my weight, 
is it my shoes or
the jeans i wear, 
the shirt that goes over my chest, 
or is it my coat that i wear on the cold days, 
the way i present myself, 
love myself or the way i am myself, 
my personality, sense of humor, 
writing skills, social skills, or people skills
or the school i attend, or attended in my past, 
my choice of friends, my choice of words, 
genre of music that is my preference, 
favorite poets or favorite musicians, 
is it the one i choose to love
or choose not to love, 
is it my relationship with my family
could this be what makes me.  

me


What makes you cry? 
I pray it’s not always me 
As you have convinced me many times
The real me
Would never try to hurt you

I know you are in pain
And probably hate me.
But you don’t hate me 
As much as you miss me
Truth be known

I show more of a tendency 
To abandon you to your locked closet
Of whore’s clothes and dildos

You are predictably stronger 
Than most souls 
I encounter in the deafening mist of empty dreams


What makes you cry, when I’m not to blame? 

Your wisdom and care
Your helping hands
In the trouble's layer
All tell me why I love you
And what makes you special too

Your calmness and peace
In the time of stress
And a strong support
During the time of mess
All tell me why I love you
And what makes you so special too

Your lessons on life
and handling of fear
You showing big dreams
And wiping away the tears
All tell me why I love you
And what makes you special too

Your way of easing 
My troubles and pain
Your swaping bad times
With happiness and gain
All tell me why I love you
And what makes you special too.



WHAT man may learn, what man may do,
Of right or wrong of false or true,
While, skipper-like, his course he steers
Through nine and twenty mingled years,
Half misconceived and half forgot,
So much I know and practise not.

Old are the words of wisdom, old
The counsels of the wise and bold:
To close the ears, to check the tongue,
To keep the pining spirit young;
To act the right, to say the true,
And to be kind whate'er you do.

Thus we across the modern stage
Follow the wise of every age;
And, as oaks grow and rivers run
Unchanged in the unchanging sun,
So the eternal march of man
Goes forth on an eternal plan. 

What matters in life
Is what you want
what matters in life
Is for what you survive
So don't let any moment
Of life to expire
Without you adding in it
A whole lot or just a bit
For wins and losses
Will all come in your way
Sunshine hay and rainy days
Will all colour your way
So do something extravagent
And significant in your life
So when you're gone from here
You're remembered and missed dear
For all your good deeds
For all your encouragements
For all your compassion
And your character's attraction
And that's the only thing
That all really matters here
In your enriched and empowered life
Where with courage you survive. 

What moves your soul? 
What takes away your dole? 

What enlightens your heart? 
What gives you a brighter start? 

What awakens your spirit? 
What gives you high merits? 

What brings you inner peace? 
What helps your pain to cease? 

Be grateful for all these gifts
That brings you joy and uplifts

And calms your nerves and mind
And makes you caring and kind

And colors your world bright
Where you feel happiness light

Falling upon and making your day
And shining bright in your way

Just forget your fear, pain and dole
And look for things which moves your soul

For when your heart and mind are at peace
Enlightment will follow you with ease. 

What new year will bring no one could tell
Whether tons of happiness or tears in eye shell
Because what will happen next, no one can say
So its hard to determine or say something today

So its good if just once you can learn in your life
Few rules of happiness to live and survive
then you will never feel ever alone or lost
In life's market where feelings don't have any cost

Then carefully watches them closely for a while
To see whether they'll smile or sigh
And whether they lose hope or still they try

So even if life's most difficult phase comes along
And seems very crude, tough and long
Just promise yourself  never to lose hope
And stay away from the tears of mope

Because not now, not tomorrow but I know pretty soon
Your test and trials and period of noon
Will end and say once again to you
New year's happiness is reserved for you. 

What if the light at the end of the tunnel, 
goes off when I get there


A SOUND of tumult troubles all the air,
Like the low thunders of a sultry sky
Far-rolling ere the downright lightnings glare;
The hills blaze red with warnings; foes draw nigh,
Treading the dark with challenge and reply.
Behold the burden of the prophet's vision;
The gathering hosts, — the Valley of Decision,
Dusk with the wings of eagles wheeling o'er.
It breaks in thunder and the whirlwind's roar!
Even so, Father! Let Thy will be done;
Turn and o'erturn, end what Thou hast begun
In judgment or in mercy: as for me,
If but the least and frailest, let me be
Evermore numbered with the truly free
Who find Thy service perfect liberty!
I fain would thank Thee that my mortal life
Has reached the hour (albeit through care and pain)
When Good and Evil, as for final strife,
Close dim and vast on Armageddon's plain;
And Michael and his angels once again
Drive howling back the Spirits of the Night.
Oh for the faith to read the signs aright
And, from the angle of Thy perfect sight,
See Truth's white banner floating on before;
And the Good Cause, despite of venal friends,
And base expedients, move to noble ends;
See Peace with Freedom make to Time amends,
And, through its cloud of dust, the threshing-floor,
Flailed by the thunder, heaped with chaffless grain


I

Thus, ever, towards the azure night
Where there quivers a topaz sea,
Will function in your evening light
The Lilies, those clysters of ecstasy!

In our own age of sago, as they must,
Since all the Plants are workers first,
The Lilies will drink a blue disgust,
From your religious Prose, not verse!

– The Lily of Monsieur de Kerdrel
The sonnet of eighteen thirty, the plant,
That Lily, they bestow on ‘The Minstrel’
With the carnation and the amaranth!

Lilies! Lilies! You see never a one!
Yet in your Verses, like the Sinners’
Sleeves, those of soft-footed women,
Always those white flowers shiver!

Always, Dear, when you take a bathe,
Your Shirt with yellow armpits rots
Swells to the breeze of rising day,
Above the soiled forget-me-nots!

Love, only, through your nets
Smuggles Lilies – O unequal!
And the Woodland Violets,
The dark Nymphs’ sugary spittle!. 


II

O Poets, if you could but own
To the red on the laurel’s firm stem 
To the Roses, the Roses, blown,
With a thousand octaves swollen!

If BANVILLE could make them snow,
Blood-stained, whirling in gyrations,
Blacking the eye of that stranger so,
Who sees wicked interpretations!

In your forests, by your paths,
O so placid photographers!
Like the stoppers on carafes,
The Flora’s more or less diverse!

Always the vegetables, French,
Absurd, consumptive, up for a fight,
Bellies of basset hounds they drench,
Peacefully passed in evening light;

Always, after fearful drawings
Of blue Lotus or that Sunflower,
Pink prints, subjects befitting
Girls in communion’s sweet hour!

The Asoka Ode agrees with the
Loretto window stanza; showers
Of bright butterflies, heavy, flutter,
Dunging on the daisy flowers.

Old verdures, old braided ribbons!
O vegetable biscuit bakes!
Fantastic flowers of old Salons!
– For cockchafers, not rattlesnakes,

Those vegetable dolls in tears
Grandville would have mislaid
In the margin, sucking colours
From spiteful stars with eye-shades!

Yes, the drooling of your flutes
Produces precious sugar!
– Heaps of fried eggs in old boots,
Lily, Lilac, Rose, Asoka!.

O white Hunter, running through,
Stocking-less, the Panic field,
Shouldn’t you, couldn’t you
Acquire a little botany?

You’d have succeed, I’m afraid,
To russet Crickets, Spanish Fly,
Rio golds to Rhine blue, Norway
To Florida, in the blink of an eye:

But, Dear, art cannot, for us,
– It’s true – permit, it’s wrong, 
To the astounding Eucalyptus,
Boa-Constrictors, hexameter-long;

There-! As if Mahogany
Served, even in our Guiana,
Only the Capuchin monkey
To ride the mad weight of liana!

– In short, a single Flower: is it,
Lily or Rosemary, live or dead, 
Worth a spot of sea-gull’s shit,
Worth a candle drip, I said?

– And I mean what I say, mind!
Even you, squatting there, in one
Of those bamboo-huts – blind
Shut, behind brown Persian curtain –

You’d scrawl about things floral
Worthy of some wild Oise department!. 
– Poet, yet that’s a rationale
No less laughable than it’s arrogant!


IV

Speak, not of pampas in the spring,
Black with terrible rebellions,
But of tobacco, cotton growing!
Speak of exotic harvest seasons!

Speak, white brow that Phoebus tanned,
Of how many dollars Pedro
Velasquez of Havana earned;
En-shit the Bay of Sorrento

Where in thousands rest the Swans;
Let your stanzas undertake
The draining of the mangrove swamps,
Filled with hydras, water-snakes!

Your quatrains plunge in blood-wet groves
Return, bringing Humanity
Diverse offerings, sugars, cloves,
Lozenges and rubber-trees!

Let us know if the yellowness
Of snowy Peaks, near the Tropic,
Is prolific insect’s nests
Or lichens microscopic!

Seek, O Hunter, our wish what’s more,
Diverse fragrant madders,
That, for our Army, Nature 
Might cause to bloom in trousers!

Seek, beside the slumbering Glades,
Flowers that look like muzzles, oh,
Out of which drip gold pomades,
On the dark hide of the buffalo!

Seek wild fields, where in the Blue
Trembles the silver of pubescence,
Calyxes of fiery eggs that brew
Steeped in burning oily essence!

Seek the Thistle’s cotton-bin,
Whose downy wool ten asses
With ember eyes toil to spin!
Seek flowers which are chassis!

Yes, seek at the heart of black seams
Nigh-on stone-like flowers – marvels! –
That near their hard pale ovaries
Bear soft gemmiferous tonsils!

Serve us, O Crammer, as you can,
On a fine vermilion platter
Stews of syrupy Lilies, plan 
To corrode our German silver!


V

Many will sing of Love sublime,
The thief of sombre Indulgence:
Not Renan, nor Murr the cat, I’m 
Sure, know Thyrsi, blue, immense!

You’ll quicken, in our torpors,
Hysterias, through your fragrances;
Exalt us towards candours
Purer than Marys’ whitenesses-

Colonist! Trader! Medium!
Your Rhyme, pink, white, will be
A welling ray of sodium,
A well-tapped dripping rubber-tree!

From your dark Poems – Juggler!
Let dioptric white, green, red,
Burst out like strange flowers,
Electric butterflies instead!

See! It’s the Century of hell!
Telegraph poles will honour
– A lyre, where steel songs swell,
Your magnificent shoulder!

Rhyme us above all a version
On the ills of potato blight!
– And to aid the composition
Of Poems of mysterious light

To be read from Treguier
To Paramaribo, don’t forget
To buy Tomes by Monsieur Figuier,
– Illustrated – from Monsieur Hachette

An extraordinary time you have waited
Quiet, in no kind of rush
You must be pleased now that it's over
Your time in the African bush

The grass stalks that rippled around you
The animals passing you by
The fierce yellow sun beating down
From the blue of your African sky.

When you finally burst into flower, 
In blossoms of yellow and red
The eight year old girl who unearthed you
Couldn't read the notice that said

Achtung!  Minen

What remains
is all that is left
something no one cares about anymore
it is not useful
we don't need it
it is just excess
just useless nothing that nobody needs
what remains
can you tell me
no
you can't
there is nothing left to tell
the story is over
but a new chapter is beginning
and that is
something
that means
everything
nothing is worthless
everything is alive is some way
either in memories
imagination
or in our hearts
what remains
is the strongest
for it is what has lasted through the toughest of times
it has survived
what remains
is
a stronger thing
with a well lived life


A dad is a like an oak tree, 
with his feet firmly planted
in the soil of our birth. 
He’s the solid hardwood 
we all aspire to be, 
strong, trusting, kind, 
and the one who will always
be there for us.

His long arms are
like protective branches 
reaching wide
around his grove of seedlings 
and anyone standing
in his shade
feels safe and secure
and loved.

A dad's trunk may widen, 
his leaves above 
may pale and thin, 
but he will always be 
our mighty yet gentle oak, 
the creator of our forest, 
and eternally loved. 


A fig tree? The one that never dies, 	
Producing figs of knowledge yearly
A tree of life that never sleeps, 
Growing leaves daily.
Among Barbary bushes, 
Under the burning rays of the sun, 
At the twilight of the day
The teacher tree spreads its sturdy roots, 
Sturdier than the hands of Zeus
Emitting bright hope and waking any dope.
Stand up! Stand up for a teacher, mope! 
He is a prophet without a Book
Ponder well over his Letter and care for the better.
No! He is the best cook
Serving you provocative meaty thoughts
With life-changing bread sauce.
O the candle of darkness! O the helping hand of the poor! 
They dust it all with your overall, 
Asking you to carry the can of their silly overhauls, 
Caring less about you, shutting you in a dirty cell
With fifty tables and more, enclosed by four graffiti walls.
What a fool if you forgot who made you all.
O the camel of the future! 
Carry the burden of the age and bring us a quick change.


Everyone learns what's known as the Arabic numerals
like many learnt the Roman numerals
Anyone can: 
Dine on delicious swiss rolls
Snack on french fries
Read the Arabian Nights
Eat the Danish pastry wow
Let the Spanish moss grow! 
Sip cappuchino in their china
by the light of chinese lanterns
playing chinese checkers
Drink Irish coffee
dreaming the American dream
Have a scotch egg
Bind an old novel
with scotch tape.
Visit an Italianate villa
Wearing Cashmere sweaters 
Ah spread out exquisite Persian rugs
Dress before Welsh dressers
Wear Morocco boots
Play Australian rules
Blow the English horn
Roast some Indian corn.
Relax in a Turkish Bath
Pass by a Dutch barn
Own an Afghan hound
Recline upon the Ottoman! 
Pet and train a German shepherd
Get and gain a Siamese cat.
Taste the yorkshire pudding
Crack a Brazil nut
Watch sport fans 
form a Mexican wave.
Worn the Dutch breeches? 
Ok bear the Indian summer
Watch online
a Siberian tiger
Slice the swede (turnip)   

Why yes, after all
the world we live in
is indeed a mega jumbo global village
So come one come all into the melting pot
Hate and fight no race be they Arab or Scot
It's a small world after all.
We dwell in a globular ball, merely a massive hall.
United we stand, divided we fall. 


Forever and ever
The saying goes
But what's in eternity
Can it come close
To the time I'd love
To spend with you? 

The seconds they go
One after the other
Until a year's passed
Without you it's a bother

If you only knew
How much I missed you
More than there are stars
To count in the sky
To be where you are
Would make eternity pass by


It use to be
Early mornings late nights
Partying everyday all day
My phone constantly ringing
'Ashley where you at'
Out and about all day
Never ever home
Enough money to buy a car
Never saved dime
Buying bag after bag
A couple bottles here and there
Never no time for bullshit
Always on the go
Catch me if you can
Now its
Watch the sunrise then go to bed
Up all night long
Parties once in awhile
My phone never ringing
Home all day long
Not enough money
To even get a pack of gum
Still got bags after bags
Still a couple bottles here and there
Still no time for bullshit
Never on the go
Constantly watching my little cousin
Now anybody can catch me


Love hurts
But it should never strike
Love can be lovely
But should never tell you what to do
Love should listen
Not ignore your feelings
Love should be there all the time
Not only when love wants
Love should be special
Not a trip to the hospital
Love is a commitment
Not a call once a month
Love should be happy
No tears should flow
Love should be forever
Not a broken heart
Love is what love wants
But your the only one that controls the love
So whats love


When you was a little kid
 You used to play a game
 You still play me
 What's my name
 
 Get a piece of paper
 Get your self a pen
 If you're good enough at this game
 You just might win
 
 You got to get an X
 You got to get an O
 You got to get more than two
 Three in a row
 
 What's my game
 You really don't know
 Cat got your tongue
 It's tick tack toe. 

You slowly take away my rights 
Like a slow poison
Hoping I will not give a fight
I can see without a light
Even in the black darkness of the night

What’s on your mind? 
My dear

You ponder thoughtfully away
Almost every single day
How to get rid of me in your play
Trying to frustrate me
Sadly you underrate me
Attempting absurdly to captivate me
With your charming sweet lies
But your deception shows in your eyes

What’s on your mind? 
I ask you

You look as though, full of fear
Perhaps you are horrified
At your own wicked ideas
Scenarios playing out inwards
Common attributes of a coward

What’s on your mind? 
I say to you
Your face looks already troubled
Before you undertake your actions
Pretending you are worried
About my possible reactions

What’s on your mind? 

I have no fear
I am ready and steady to prepare
For the battle of minds
This battle will be one of a kind

I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows,
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing. 

Sure, deck your limbs in pants,
Yours are the limbs, my sweeting.
You look divine as you advance . . .
Have you seen yourself retreating

WHAT'S the use o' folks a-frownin'
When the way's a little rough? 
Frowns lay out the road fur smilin'
You'll be wrinkled soon enough.
What's the use?
What's the use o' folks a-sighin'?
It's an awful waste o' breath,
An' a body can't stand wastin'
What he needs so bad in death.
What's the use?
What's the use o' even weepin'?
Might as well go long an' smile.
Life, our longest, strongest arrow,
Only lasts a little while.
What's the use

Whats there to say
At the end of another day
Whats there to say when you're all alone
When your voice is a dreadful tone
Whats there to say when all is lost, and gone
Watching with red eyes at the dawn
Whats there to say when you choose between survival or humanity
Or simply lose your mind to insanity
Whats there to say.  . 

when you become them


To walk down a street in that neighborhood 
and not get hassled you had to look like 
you could deal with abuse—you had to 
be able to look into the lowered 
car's tinted window when it slowed up
to you, playing heavy bass you felt inside 
your buttons, until it pulled away, because you 
looked like you knew and were not surprised by 
what that sound-track to a miserable time 
on cheap chrome wheels was all about. 
And you never let up remembering 
the faces outside Wood Shop  
especially the one you thought was ready 
to rip your skinny white ass to pieces—
and he was you found out later, but nodded 
"a’right" when you said "for you, but bring it 
back sharpened, " and tapped each other’s fists, 
his holding the handed-down chisel you brought 
into the shop. And you had to know and still 
better be able to twenty-five years later 
know again how to say in the right kind of tone, 
'What's up? ' And you have to say it 
with your eyes looking straight but maimed 
and steady with what they know from what 
they have seen that any harm someone intends 
for you isn't going to be justified or worth it—
and you better say it without anger—
and you better say it with your hands 
outside your pockets, because you 
have to show in that look that you know 
the unwanted guest sits on a thorn, 
so someone wanting to mess with you 
senses you know it, and knows 
for sure you deal with it, 
because you do, and because that 
is going to be 
your bond. 

Motivation, 
it drives us all, 
whether you're proud of it, 
or you're sickened by it, 
it's what keeps you living, 
and it's what keeps you going. 

Know this as the sand shifts thru the hourglass of time
That we r great luminaries that outshine the sun, moon n stars combine
Our Glory is born with the total renewal of the Mind
By that eternal fire within, that carnal eyes can't find
We all pure spirits that's trapped in this 'cage' called flesh
Weighed down by lustful desires but in the saviors stripes forgiven and born afresh
This day has mercy found in our dying bodies a dwelling place
This day Grace has gone before us leading the pace
There's redemption not only for the elite in suites and ties
But also for the many like you and I

Know this, as days turns into nights and night turns into days
That infinite is outer space, yet nothing compares in greatness to the human race	
Chains shackle wrists
Sins battle wits
Wind topples things, bringing birth newness in seasons
The living passes on as legends, perhaps alas they reconcile with their essence
All memories of the present are lost in transition and yesterday becomes a myth
The sun rises not
Ambitions spirals back to naught
Darkness becomes almost tangible when the soul sheds earthly garments and enters into the realms of the invisible
On the other side, The Light beckons them that obeyed when life was gay
Be not dismayed children of the day
Grace remains till the silver chord breaks
Find meaning behind these lines cus where you stand is like a land mine
Your survival depends on where you step
Cherish today for tomorrow you may not awake where you slept.* 


What shall I your true love tell, 
Earth forsaking maid? 
What shall I your true love tell 
When life's spectre's laid? 
"Tell him that, our side the grave, 
Maid may not believe 
Life should be so sad to have, 
That's so sad to leave!" 
What shall I your true love tell 
When I come to him? 
What shall I your true love tell 
Eyes growing dim? 
"Tell him this, when you shall part 
From a maiden pined; 
That I see him with my heart, 
Now my eyes are blind
 

What shall I your true love tell 
Speaking while is scant? 
What shall I your true love tell 
Death's white postulant? 
"Tell him love, with speech at strife, 
For last utterance saith: 
`I who loved with all my life, 
Loved with all my death.'" 



*Is it the fear of career, 
or the fear for someone own, 
or is it the fear of love
hanging somewhere in the horizon? 

Is it the fear of future
or the fear of separation from home
or the lady is simply fearing
from something which is unknown? 

Does the root of the fear 
is clinging from the past
or the fear is something very worse
greater than my thoughts? 

All i know our fears are nothing
in larger context of life, 
It just stagnates our vision
to look beyond the strife. 


She Hates Her Smile
She hates her laugh
the way she dresses
the clothes she has

she keeps saying
no one likes her
more than a friend
i somewhat doubt that

cuz everyone has someone
someone has only one
One that will love
and die for that love


the way that she looks
makes her want to die
but for someone she'll meet
it's the best that they've had


Spain was a taut, dry drum-head 
Daily beating a dull thud 
Flatlands and eagle's nest 
Silence lashed by the storm. 
How much, to the point of weeping, in my soul 
I love your hard soil, your poor bread, 
Your poor people, how much in the deep place 
Of my being there is still the lost flower 
Of your wrinkled villages, motionless in time 
And your metallic meadows 
Stretched out in the moonlight through the ages, 
Now devoured by a false god. 


All your confinement, your animal isolation 
While you are still conscious 
Surrounded by the abstract stones of silence, 
Your rough wine, your smooth wine 
Your violent and dangerous vineyards. 


Solar stone, pure among the regions 
Of the world, Spain streaked 
With blood and metal, blue and victorious 
Proletarian Spain, made of petals and bullets 
Unique, alive, asleep - resounding. 

We know who the killers are, 
We have watched them strut before us
As proud as sick Mussolinis',
We have watched them strut before us
Compassionless and arrogant,
They paraded before us,
Like angels of death
Protected by the law.

It is now an open secret
Black people do not have
Chips on their shoulders,
They just have injustice on their backs
And justice on their minds,
And now we know that the road to liberty
Is as long as the road from slavery.


The death of Stephen Lawrence
Has taught us to love each other
And never to take the tedious task
Of waiting for a bus for granted.
Watching his parents watching the cover-up
Begs the question
What are the trading standards here?
Why are we paying for a police force
That will not work for us? 

The death of Stephen Lawrence
Has taught us
That we cannot let the illusion of freedom
Endow us with a false sense of security as we walk the streets,
The whole world can now watch
The academics and the super cops
Struggling to define institutionalised racism
As we continue to die in custody
As we continue emptying our pockets on the pavements,
And we continue to ask ourselves
Why is it so official
That black people are so often killed
Without killers? 


We are not talking about war or revenge
We are not talking about hypothetics or possibilities,
We are talking about where we are now
We are talking about how we live now
In dis state
Who like raving,
Because the death of Stephen Lawrence
Has taught us that racism is easy when
You have friends in high places.
And friends in high places
Have no use whatsoever
When they are not your friends. 


Dear Mr Condon, 
Pop out of Teletubby land,
And visit reality,
Come to an honest place
And get some advice from your neighbours,
Be enlightened by our community,
Neglect your well-paid ignorance
Because 
We know who the killers are. 

Who says that all must vanish?
Who knows, perhaps the flight
of the bird you wound remains,
and perhaps flowers survive
caresses in us, in their ground.

It isn't the gesture that lasts,
but it dresses you again in gold
armor --from breast to knees--
and the battle was so pure
an Angel wears it after you.




All was quiet in the Garden of Eden
and not a fig-leaf stirred. 

but after the Fall of Man
(usually forwards and enthusiastically, we note)     
literature
required some word for what happens
when evening falls, the curfew tolls the knell of parting day, 
lovers begin to nuzzle, friends 
remember a prior engagement, journalists 
try to bribe the night porter, and
some novelists, blushing, draw the curtain, while others
brighten and begin to enjoy their work; and filmmakers
need to decide between a darkling screen, 
a symbolic firework display, or
box-office returns.


Egyptian hieroglyphics afford little clue (there's
a chance  missed) : but jump-cutting now to Anglo-Saxon usage, 
Chaucer, Father of the English Language so we're told, 
used 'swyve', in a masculine sort of way: 
'he swyved her bolt upright' leaves little to the imagination.

Then courtly French may have given us 'make love' -
an oxymoron if ever there was one -
being still, however the romantic hope of many, and the dread of 
Casanovas the world around, as they have it off (sic) . 

Shakespeare, being a poet, immortalised it as
'making the beast with two backs' - graphic, but
it didn't catch on with the tabloids, who prefer
only four-letter words which fit the headlines better.

The Italian Renaissance, noticing in its Mediterranean way
the resemblance of the male danglies to a fig fruit
(backtrack to Eden here for speculations)     
may well have given us (the Florentine g being pronounced gutturally)     
that English word with added onomatopoeia
though let's not go into that, 
which now that blasphemy's out, is all too common, 
rendering a much-enjoyed activity all too often as a term of abuse
which I leave to psychologists to work out. I refer to
fuck. 


Then as this term, which it doesn't take a lip-reader
to note frequently on the lips (and spare-time pursuits)     
became a sort of holy word of abuse, 
and lawyers lurked around the gossip columns, 
words mingling the comic, the non-accusatory
and the slightly admiring, were sought: 
and so the tennis world gave us Bonking Becker. 
while sportsmen like, naturally enough, to 'score'


A psycho-sociological study might here extend, 
priapically, to distinguish between male terms such as
'Cor, I'd like to give 'er one. ' which makes the assumption
that females are eternally grateful for such male generosity, 
and any distinguishing solely female terms 
though I'm told girls' nights out are descriptive in their appreciation.

But for girls pulling boys, either the terms are non-gender-specific, 
or in short supply, or have passed me by. Personally, 
I like the biblical 'and she took him in unto her'
which has a certain feminine sense of choice about it
but too long for the tabloid headlines. 




At first, the scissors seemed perfectly harmless.
They lay on the kitchen table in the blue light.

Then I began to notice them all over the house,
at night in the pantry, or filling up bowls in the cellar

where there should have been apples. They appeared under rugs,
lumpy places where one would usually settle before the fire,

or suddenly shining in the sink at the bottom of soupy water.
Once, I found a pair in the garden, stuck in turned dirt

among the new bulbs, and one night, under my pillow,
I felt something like a cool long tooth and pulled them out

to lie next to me in the dark. Soon after that I began
to collect them, filling boxes, old shopping bags,

every suitcase I owned. I grew slightly uncomfortable
when company came. What if someone noticed them

when looking for forks or replacing dried dishes? I longed
to throw them out, but how could I get rid of something

that felt oddly like grace? It occurred to me finally
that I was meant to use them, and I resisted a growing compulsion

to cut my hair, although in moments of great distraction,
I thought it was my eyes they wanted, or my soft belly

—exhausted, in winter, I laid them out on the lawn.
The snow fell quite as usual, without any apparent hesitation

or discomfort. In spring, as expected, they were gone.
In their place, a slight metallic smell, and the dear muddy earth. 


The birds against the April wind 
Flew northward, singing as they flew; 
They sang, "The land we leave behind 
Has swords for corn-blades, blood for dew
 


"O wild-birds, flying from the South, 
What saw and heard ye, gazing down?" 
"We saw the mortar's upturned mouth, 
The sickened camp, the blazing town! 

"Beneath the bivouac's starry lamps, 
We saw your march-worn children die; 
In shrouds of moss, in cypress swamps, 
We saw your dead uncoffined lie. 

"We heard the starving prisoner's sighs 
And saw, from line and trench, your sons 
Follow our flight with home-sick eyes 
Beyond the battery's smoking guns
 


"And heard and saw ye only wrong 
And pain," I cried, "O wing-worn flocks?" 
"We heard," they sang, "the freedman's song, 
The crash of Slavery's broken locks! 

"We saw from new, uprising States 
The treason-nursing mischief spurned, 
As, crowding Freedom's ample gates, 
The long-estranged and lost returned. 

"O'er dusky faces, seamed and old, 
And hands horn-hard with unpaid toil, 
With hope in every rustling fold, 
We saw your star-dropt flag uncoil. 

"And struggling up through sounds accursed, 
A grateful murmur clomb the air; 
A whisper scarcely heard at first, 
It filled the listening heavens with prayer. 

"And sweet and far, as from a star, 
Replied a voice which shall not cease, 
Till, drowning all the noise of war, 
It sings the blessed song of peace!" 

So to me, in a doubtful day 
Of chill and slowly greening spring, 
Low stooping from the cloudy gray, 
The wild-birds sang or seemed to sing. 

They vanished in the misty air, 
The song went with them in their flight; 
But lo! they left the sunset fair, 
And in the evening there was light. 


If an inaudible whistle
blown between our lips
can send him home to us, 
then silence is perhaps
the sound of spiders breathing
and roots mining the earth; 
it may be asparagus heaving, 
headfirst, into the light
and the long brown sound
of cracked cups, when it happens. 
We would like to ask the dog
if there is a continuous whir
because the child in the house 
keeps growing, if the snake
really stretches full length
without a click and the sun
breaks through clouds without
a decibel of effort, 
whether in autumn, when the trees
dry up their wells, there isn't a shudder
too high for us to hear.


What is it like up there
above the shut-off level
of our simple ears?
For us there was no birth cry,
the newborn bird is suddenly here, 
the egg broken, the nest alive,
and we heard nothing when the world changed. 


Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there.
And the Drano won't work but smells dangerous, and the crusty dishes have piled up
 
waiting for the plumber I still haven't called. This is the everyday we spoke of.
It's winter again: the sky's a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through
 
the open living-room windows because the heat's on too high in here and I can't turn it off.
For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking,
 
I've been thinking: This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those
wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve,
 
I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush: This is it.
Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning.
 
What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want
whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kiss—we want more and more and then more of it.
 
But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass,
say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep
 
for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I'm speechless:
I am living. I remember you. 


O thou whose face hath felt the Winter's wind,
Whose eye has seen the snow-clouds hung in mist 
And the black elm tops 'mong the freezing stars, 
To thee the spring will be a harvest-time. 
O thou, whose only book has been the light 
Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on 
Night after night when Phoebus was away, 
To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn. 
O fret not after knowledge -- I have none, 
And yet my song comes native with the warmth. 
O fret not after knowledge -- I have none, 
And yet the Evening listens. He who saddens 
At thought of idleness cannot be idle, 
And he's awake who thinks himself asleep. 


The shadows grow and deepen round me,
I feel the deffall in the air;
The muezzin of the darkening thicket,
I hear the night-thrush call to prayer.

The evening wind is sad with farewells,
And loving hands unclasp from mine;
Alone I go to meet the darkness
Across an awful boundary-line.

As from the lighted hearths behind me
I pass with slow, reluctant feet,
What waits me in the land of strangeness?
What face shall smile, what voice shall greet?

What space shall awe, what brightness blind me?
What thunder-roll of music stun?
What vast processions sweep before me
Of shapes unknown beneath the sun?

I shrink from unaccustomed glory,
I dread the myriad-voiced strain;
Give me the unforgotten faces,
And let my lost ones speak again.

He will not chide my mortal yearning
Who is our Brother and our Friend;
In whose full life, divine and human,
The heavenly and the earthly blend.

Mine be the joy of soul-communion,
The sense of spiritual strength renewed,
The reverence for the pure and holy,
The dear delight of doing good.

No fitting ear is mine to listen
An endless anthem's rise and fall;
No curious eye is mine to measure
The pearl gate and the jasper wall.

For love must needs be more than knowledge:
What matter if I never know
Why Aldebaran's star is ruddy,
Or warmer Sirius white as snow!

Forgive my human words, O Father!
I go Thy larger truth to prove;
Thy mercy shall transcend my longing
I seek but love, and Thou art Love!

I go to find my lost and mourned for
Safe in Thy sheltering goodness still,
And all that hope and faith foreshadow
Made perfect in Thy holy will

HIS chosen comrades thought at school
He must grow a famous man;
He thought the same and lived by rule,
All his twenties crammed with toil;
'What then?' sang Plato's ghost.  'What then?'

Everything he wrote was read,
After certain years he won
Sufficient money for his need,
Friends that have been friends indeed;
'What then?' sang Plato's ghost.  ' What then?'

All his happier dreams came true --
A small old house, wife, daughter, son,
Grounds where plum and cabbage grew,
poets and Wits about him drew;
'What then.?' sang Plato's ghost.  'What then?'


The work is done,' grown old he thought,
'According to my boyish plan;
Let the fools rage, I swerved in naught,
Something to perfection brought';
But louder sang that ghost, 'What then.


'To be or not to be
Is really a hard querry
For no one can always get
Things in his mind that's set
For many things are considered in ream
As only our impossible dream
And then they're told to forget it
And pick something else from the kit
From the kit of our lifves
where we're bound to survive
And then again we come to the task
And 'what needs to be done' from us we ask. 


Do I know you? 
Sometimes I'm sure I do, 
- at times, even better
than you know yourself.
Other times, I'm sure
I don't know you at all.

Something is happening, 
I will agree.
Your words have caught me up
in something big
and we've made a real connection
here in a short time.


Do you know me? 
You think you do.
You've read parts of me, 
those I've sheared off
to rhyme or not rhyme, 
but is that knowing? 

One thing I know for sure, 
your wants and desires
scare the hell out of me
and my instincts tell me
to run and not look back.

Where do we go from here? 
.  what to do about you. 


What was it you had sown which should have borne a rich harvest? 
You had but tanned a carcass hide, 
shaped and stretched it taut on pegs, 
(Your only care your own body which you pegged to the bonds of desire) . 
But counsel to a fool is labour lost, 
Like a ball thrown at a big-sized pillar, 
rebounding but not hitting the mark; 
Or fruitless as feeding a tawny bullock on sweet molasses, 
And expect a yield of milk from him.


I SING what was lost and dread what was won,
I walk in a battle fought over again,
My king a lost king, and lost soldiers my men;
Feet to the Rising and Setting may run,
They always beat on the same small stone. 

You are heading towards whom await you anxiously, 
And among the crowd you dance, divine music.
With you roses, 
Frozen in time, 
As in that old movie.
What was this feeling? 


You are in full spring
And I, 
Ceased to exist, listen I stop, 
Dragged by this thy wind, 
I walk away, I disappear
If I'm with you..
What was this feeling? 

However, you look at me
And no mercy, 
Those honest eyes, 
I cannot give up, 
I cannot stop. 

I turn so clear, 
I cannot hide, 
Through this small heart, 
You look closely
You blaze so much


Only you can tell me if it is impossible
Simple, challenging. 
You make me go around, wings, you raise me up
You're a journey without destination, 
You are freedom, skies.

You always appear, 
Suddenly.
Everything you say and do is so bright, 
It baffles me, 
And I close my eyes 
I cannot help but to idolize you.


What was this feeling? 
After much suffering and doubt, 
This smile, the answer was so simple.
To tremble, my heart starts. 
I am a lost petal, 
I shall never leave your side. 

Geese appear high over us,
pass, and the sky closes. Abandon,
as in love or sleep, holds
them to their way, clear
in the ancient faith: what we need
is here. And we pray, not
for new earth or heaven, but to be
quiet in heart, and in eye,
clear. What we need is here. 


no ambition
to nail the truth down, 
bask in the glory, 
shove it down throats
starved for messianic voice

or to cut and paste, 
digitize, and cyber immortalize it


I crave your story
but the moment is all we have
back to back, side by side, 
in each others face
we are worlds apart

I hear your eyes whisper
'what we think we are'
my tongue twirls flavors
of the earth's cuisines
from your mouth can only read a language
fractured by the movement of your lips


we blaze blasphemous trails
to rise above sanctioned huts
with bolted doors, 
shuttered windows, 
and fetish fueled excursions
through the world wide web

in the realm of wooden clocks
no one knows whose spring is stronger
or who's first in fate's line
or the bottom line

so place your bet
spin the dial
draw your straw
or you might kneel on the floor
and beg some god to show you more than
what we think we are


What we want
is never simple.
We move among the things
we thought we wanted:
a face, a room, an open book
and these things bear our names--
now they want us.
But what we want appears
in dreams, wearing disguises.
We fall past,
holding out our arms
and in the morning
our arms ache.
We don't remember the dream,
but the dream remembers us.
It is there all day
as an animal is there
under the table,
as the stars are there
even in full sun. 


Preoccupied, took
The ingredients to bake; 
Cake just didn’t rise-Did the people of Viet Nam
use lanterns of stone?
Did they hold ceremonies
to reverence the opening of buds?
Were they inclined to quiet laughter?
Did they use bone and ivory,
jade and silver, for ornament?
Had they an epic poem?
Did they distinguish between speech and singing?


Their light hearts turned to stone.
It is not remembered whether in gardens
stone gardens illumined pleasant ways.
Perhaps they gathered once to delight in blossom,
but after their children were killed
there were no more buds.
Sir, laughter is bitter to the burned mouth.
A dream ago, perhaps. Ornament is for joy.
All the bones were charred.
it is not remembered. Remember,
most were peasants; their life
was in rice and bamboo.
When peaceful clouds were reflected in the paddies
and the water buffalo stepped surely along terraces,
maybe fathers told their sons old tales.
When bombs smashed those mirrors
there was time only to scream.
There is an echo yet
of their speech which was like a song.
It was reported their singing resembled 
the flight of moths in moonlight.
Who can say? It is silent now.


They never stop asking me 
"What will you be?--
A doctor, a dancer, 
A diver at sea?" 

They never stop bugging me: 
"What will you be?" 
As if they expect me to 
Stop being me. 


When I grow up I'm going to be a Sneeze, 
And sprinkle Germs on all my Enemies. 

When I grow up I'm going to be a Toad, 
And dump on Silly Questions in the road. 

When I grow up, I'm going to be a Child. 
I'll Play the whole darn day and drive them Wild. 

What will you give me for my pound? 
Full twenty shillings round. 
What will you give me for my shilling? 
Twelve pence to give I'm willing. 
What will you give me for my penny? 
Four farthings, just so many. 


What will you say

When I die? 
You that turned my life into a tornado
What will you tell
Those who will weep and cry
When I die? 
What will those I have sincerely loved do? 
What will all I have known say about me? 
They are the  only proof
That I passed by one day
What will you say when I die? 
Or will-you just cry and be shy? 
What will you say when I die
Will you pray? 
Or will you try
To forget then, go your way


What will you say

Some women want their spouses
to be real hardcore and a bully
some to be  soft and fair bosses 
others compassionate and silly
while others  want them flawless
just to be loyal, caring and cool
others prefer them to be ruthless
heartless hunk, brute and a fool

Some women don’t like to be pampered
but get their orgasm by being hammered
some prefer buttocks spanked till it bleeds
another chained, dragged until she pleads
some women want lives free of man’s control
some do prefer enslavement to routine patrol 
don’t jump to hasty conclusions about women
some proffer kind husbands joy and  good omen

treat women with respect, and loving tenderness 
they are the harmony to turn man’s lyrics to songs
sow love, compassion, attention and faithfulness 
to reap all the virtues at where your heart belongs
let the beauty in her ugliness intoxicate your mind
and her inadequacies humour and fuel your passion
let her folly and weaknesses make  you to be kind
for she overlooks all your failings in the same fashion


We stand in the rain in a long line
waiting at Ford Highland Park. For work.
You know what work is—if you're
old enough to read this you know what
work is, although you may not do it.
Forget you. This is about waiting,
shifting from one foot to another.
Feeling the light rain falling like mist
into your hair, blurring your vision
until you think you see your own brother
ahead of you, maybe ten places.
You rub your glasses with your fingers,
and of course it's someone else's brother,
narrower across the shoulders than
yours but with the same sad slouch, the grin
that does not hide the stubbornness,
the sad refusal to give in to
rain, to the hours wasted waiting,
to the knowledge that somewhere ahead
a man is waiting who will say, 'No,
we're not hiring today,' for any
reason he wants. You love your brother,
now suddenly you can hardly stand
the love flooding you for your brother,
who's not beside you or behind or
ahead because he's home trying to
sleep off a miserable night shift
at Cadillac so he can get up
before noon to study his German.
Works eight hours a night so he can sing
Wagner, the opera you hate most,
the worst music ever invented.
How long has it been since you told him
you loved him, held his wide shoulders,
opened your eyes wide and said those words,
and maybe kissed his cheek? You've never
done something so simple, so obvious,
not because you're too young or too dumb,
not because you're jealous or even mean
or incapable of crying in
the presence of another man, no,
just because you don't know what work is. 


Wasn't on purpose that I drilled 
through my finger or the nurse 
laughed. She apologized 
three times and gave me a shot 
of something that was a lusher 
apology. The person 
who drove me home 
said my smile was a smeared 
totem that followed 
his body that night as it arced 
over a cliff in a dream.
He's always flying 
in his dreams and lands 
on cruise ships or hovers 
over Atlanta with an erection.
He put me to bed and the drugs
wore off and I woke 
to cannibals at my extremities. 
I woke with a sense
of what nails in the palms 
might do to a spirit 
temporarily confined to flesh. 
That too was an accident 
if you believe Judas 
merely wanted to be loved. 
Urban the h 
had heads cut off 
that were inadequately 
bowed by dogma. To be loved 
by Blondie, Dagwood
gets nothing right 
except the hallucinogenic 
architecture of sandwiches. 
He would have drilled 
through a finger too 
while making a case for books 
on home repair and health. 
Drilling through my finger's 
not the dumbest thing 
I've done. Second place 
was approaching 
a frozen gas-cap with lighter
in hand while thinking 
heat melts ice and not 
explosion kills asshole. First 
place was passing 
through a bedroom door 
and removing silk that did not
belong to my wife.
Making a bookcase is not 
the extent of my apology. 
I've also been beaten up 
in a bar for saying huevos 
rancheros in a way 
insulting to the patrons' 
ethnicity. I've also lost 
my job because lying 
face down on the couch 
didn't jibe with my employer's 
definition of home 
office. I wanted her to come
through the door on Sunday
and see the bookcase 
she'd asked me to build 
for a year and be impressed 
that it didn't lean 
or wobble even though 
I've only leaned and often 
wobbled. Now it's half
done but certainly
a better gift with its map
of my unfaithful blood. 


What would I give for a heart of flesh to warm me through,
Instead of this heart of stone ice-cold whatever I do!
Hard and cold and small, of all hearts the worst of all.

What would I give for words, if only words would come!
But now in its misery my spirit has fallen dumb.
O merry friends, go your own way, I have never a word to say.

What would I give for tears! Not smiles but scalding tears,
To wash the black mark clean, and to thaw the frost of years,
To wash the stain ingrain, and to make me clean again. 


Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? 
Please do and let me have my say.

Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
First time I hear this and tend to believe it

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 
Your words do shake my heart a lot today.

And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
I wish I could say something as great. 

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 
How nice the words, how lovely the signs! 

And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; 
I wish these nice words were untrimmed.

And every fair from fair sometime declines, 
And when we die our memories will be shrines.
 
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd; 
How bright the day how beautiful and undimmed! 

But thy eternal summer shall not fade.
For in your poetry I will be remade? 

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st.
I'm happy to play your temperate host.

Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade, 
But we will die and our bodies fade. 

When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st.
I will die and be covered with too much dust.

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, 
So long my poet, because I shall not be 

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
So long again, for thou will soon forget me. 


Would you think he's right for me? 
Treating me like he should be
Or would you think that he's all wrong? 
That I should not be hanging on

He reminds me of you
And I never give my heart away until a love is true
But sometimes I wonder if he
Is really in love with me

I sometimes see your face in his
Do I love him because of this? 
No, he really has my heart
I knew it from the very start

I wish he was as strong as you
Persistent, confident and true
Heart as pure as gold
When we loved each other in the days of old

He's not mine to fill your place
I'd give my life to see your face
But somehow he has made his way
Right into my heart to stay


Here is an uplifting thought, 
Greater than some problems we have now rought! 

Let's care more about their minds, 
Than their brawn, 
Let's uplift their brilliance while they are still in our town. 

Never mind, 
We can't possibly actually do this! 

They say there is no time, 
They say there is no class! 

We must do this and 
We must do that! 
All the time, 
I lament, 
Who looks out for the students in this wreck? 

Most teachers who speak out against sports, 
Know it wouldn't be prudent, 
It wouldn't be right, 
Sports are society, 
Sports are their right? 

However, can we not collectively ask, 
'Is it strange to pass school, 
And then flunk out of life as a general rule? ' 

Stop to Think, 
What should we prepare the students for, 
How about those old test scores! 

However, how long can we still fail to uplift their minds, 
Before we show them the door

what yet untold is soliloquy of unwritten words
listlessly hidden in furrows of lone silence
thunder may not wake from rock of bed
gleams of light shines by pindar of stone

shadow seems to dance beneath tree leafless
art of silence reasons to flecks of falling snow
yet buried beneath deep oblivion engrossed
love stays away to delve truth unspelt

moon hides beyond the shadow of clouds
beauty resolves to glow by sorrow intoned
hours if night serenades by setting of sun
blue never weeps by whispers of rainbow

sky is torn by the dappled blue spumes
light when lies low by mystery of black
pain when painless gleaning tears
let night remember moment by etching of sorrow

silence tolls the web of sadness
horizon silhouettes by alienation
spring never raves up in stormy rain
earth fails to kiss by fear of insinuation


Walking between narrow and wide
a life of thoughts about life
brick on your left, wet cement on your right
the path is love the path is pain

branding limits of your love life
with names of your ex’s on your skin
the tattoo-man has seen you so many times
he would know what the next name would be

crawling hands on your thighs, 
sometimes narrow sometimes wide
this brick here doesn’t have a name
perhaps you would like it to be blank

 and it went so high, the brick fence
brownish red boundaries to mark the line
what you built is a fortress
what you built is a friend
-do you know what they say about walls-
-do you know what they say about doors-
what you built is a death row
what you built is the edge
But it’s safe and it’s strong and it’s better
what you built is to sign on the map


You criticize me 
You judge me
You fail to see
We are equal
Just mixed around
It’s called personalities


The sun is shining, so what
The birds are chirping, who cares? 
The dogs are barking, what for? 
The river's flowing, only from here to there

Things aren't going right, will it ever turn
Are obstacles put into place just so I will learn
How to overcome them, whatever's thrown my way
Must I repeat this lesson, day after day? 


Challenges  surely I've passed it by now
I know I've failed it a couple of times, well it really is a cow
I'm more than ready for Smooth Sailing 

My time with Challenges I'd like to be done


Are you listening to what I'm saying? 
Or is this just some meaningless braying
Come on Professor just give me a pass
So I can finally exit this class


Last night, while I lay thinking here,
some Whatifs crawled inside my ear
and pranced and partied all night long
and sang their same old Whatif song:
Whatif I'm dumb in school?
Whatif they've closed the swimming pool?
Whatif I get beat up?
Whatif there's poison in my cup?
Whatif I start to cry?
Whatif I get sick and die?
Whatif I flunk that test?
Whatif green hair grows on my chest?
Whatif nobody likes me?
Whatif a bolt of lightning strikes me?
Whatif I don't grow talle?
Whatif my head starts getting smaller?
Whatif the fish won't bite?
Whatif the wind tears up my kite?
Whatif they start a war?
Whatif my parents get divorced?
Whatif the bus is late?
Whatif my teeth don't grow in straight?
Whatif I tear my pants?
Whatif I never learn to dance?
Everything seems well, and then
the nighttime Whatifs strike again

A whisper, 
a shout, 
thoughts turned
inside out.

A laugh, 
a sigh, 
an echo
passing by.

A rhythm, 
a rhyme, 
a moment
caught in time.

A moon, 
a star, 
a gimpse 
of who you are. 

They don't make it 
the beautiful die in flame- 
suicide pills, rat poison, rope what- 
ever.  
they rip their arms off, 
throw themselves out of windows, 
they pull their eyes out of the sockets, 
reject love 
reject hate 
reject, reject. 

they don't make it 
the beautiful can't endure, 
they are butterflies 
they are doves 
they are sparrows, 
they don't make it. 

one tall shot of flame 
while the old men play checkers in the park 
one flame, one good flame 
while the old men play checkers in the park 
in the sun. 

the beautiful are found in the edge of a room 
crumpled into spiders and needles and silence 
and we can never understand why they 
left, they were so 
beautiful. 

they don't make it, 
the beautiful die young 
and leave the ugly to their ugly lives. 

lovely and brilliant: life and suicide and death 
as the old men play checkers in the sun 
in the park. 




Soon the white of your flowers
Would be unable to bear
The abundance of youth, 
As man's nostrils scent
The quarry in you. 

The whole
World becomes your scaffold

As you fall kneeling to the guillotine, 
Heavy head beheaded 
To feed the dying
As living virtue surviving outside
Man and doubly resplendent
At death. 

Farmers commiserate over wheat's  fate

when it raises head above mid range.

Victim predict it of impetuous airs. 


Get on the wheelchair
Bypass the immigration mire
Have your way swift
Through security check
Pretend you are disabled
Be an object of pity
Drag your feet
Like beggars on Bombay streets

Or put your parents on wheelchair
Even if they are like athletes fit
Gobble tonnes of sweets
Without the blood sugar
Rising even a wee bit

Then escort them in and out
Laughing at the toilers behind
Who wait in long lines
At indifferent counters
Wiping sweating foreheads
Cursing unmoving watches
Idiots who don’t realize
Craftiness they should devise
If quick success is the end in sight

This my friend is the secret
To success in the world
Do not ever be sentimental
Follow this everywhere
Thou shan’t grieve
Born thou art to survive

Put your candidates on wheelchair
Contest elections to parliament
Why not even have the chair
As election symbol
You will win for sure
Riding the sympathy wave
A tear-box is any time proof
Even against popular tides

And as you wheel your easy way out
Of the world’s numberless airports
Your head clogged with the dream
Of owning a wheelchair business in boom
Don’t forget to wink without shame
At those who still stay behind
Whose rights you have infringed

The gracefully aging ones
Octogenarians and nonagenarians
Alike of the world’s every nook and corner
Still waiting at the belts
For their baggage to arrive
Their spines held steady like steel
Shaming all the metal you wheel
Who still find ardour
In their fast aging vigour

W'EN us fellers stomp around, makin' lots o' noise,
Gramma says, 'There's certain times comes to little boys
W'en they need a shingle or the soft side of a plank;'
She says 'we're a-itchin' for a right good spank.'
An' she says, 'Now thes you wait,
It's a-comin' — soon or late,
W'en a fellers itchin' fer a spank.'
W'en a feller's out o' school, you know how he feels,
Gramma says we wriggle 'roun like a lot o' eels.
W'y it's like a man that's thes home from out o' jail. 
What's the use o' scoldin' if we pull Tray's tail?
Gramma says, tho', 'thes you wait,
It's a-comin' — soon or late,
You'se the boys that's itchin' to be spanked.'
Cats is funny creatures an' I like to make 'em yowl,
Gramma alwus looks at me with a awful scowl
An' she says, 'Young gentlemen, mamma should be thanked
Ef you'd get your knickerbockers right well spanked.'
An' she says, 'Now thes you wait,
It's a-comin' — soon or late,'
W'en a feller's itchin' to be spanked.
Ef you fin' the days is gettin' awful hot in school
An' you know a swimmin' place where it's nice and cool,
Er you know a cat-fish hole brimmin' full o' fish,
Whose a-goin' to set around school and wish? 
'Tain't no use to hide your bait,
It's a-comin' — soon or late,
W'en a feller's itchin' to be spanked.
Ol' folks know most ever'thing 'bout the world, I guess,
Gramma does, we wish she knowed thes a little less,
But I alwus kind o' think it 'ud be as well
Ef they wouldn't alwus have to up an' tell;
We kids wish 'at they'd thes wait,
It's a-comin' — soon or late,
W'en a feller's itchin' to be spanked. 

Layed out
like a beautiful display
of a life
ended.

She lies
her body sewn up
wrinkled but
made up like new.

His hands hover
over his own face.

All he had left
of the loving woman
who raised him
and he is alone.

One brother left.
One wife unsensitive.
One son unamused.
One daughter forcing.

Swallow her pride
A daughter
directing a wife
toward comfort
When a grown man cries. 


When a merry maiden marries,
Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;
Every sound becomes a song,
All is right and nothing's wrong!
From to-day and ever after
Let your tears be tears of laughter -
Every sigh that finds a vent
Be a sigh of sweet content!
When you marry merry maiden,
Then the air with love is laden;
Every flower is a rose,
Every goose becomes a swan,
Every kind of trouble goes
Where the last year's snows have gone;
Sunlight takes the place of shade
When you marry merry maid!

When a merry maiden marries
Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;
Every sound becomes a song,
All is right, and nothing's wrong.
Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow,
Get ye gone until to-morrow;
Jealousies in grim array,
Ye are things of yesterday!
When you marry merry maiden,
Then the air with joy is laden;
All the corners of the earth
Ring with music sweetly played,
Worry is melodious mirth,
Grief is joy in masquerade;
Sullen night is laughing day -
All the year is merry May

When a mounting skylark sings 
In the sunlit summer morn, 
I know that heaven is up on high, 
And on earth are fields of corn. 
But when a nightingale sings 
In the moonlit summer even, 
I know not if earth is merely earth, 
Only that heaven is heaven. 




I took a call today.
A man wished to speak to anybody.
'Who are you', I asked? 
'Oh, I don't know', the man replied.
Don't you feel like him sometimes? 

Is this what life is all about? 
All there is to know. 
I can't believe I've come this far
And still so far to go; 
I haven't scratched the surface
Barely scribbled on the page, 
And here I am about to end -
It puts me in a rage! 


We need an expiration date
To keep us to the task
Of reaching goals significant
To answer what we ask; 
It's all so very puzzling
This living that we do, 
I need my own identity
But also, I need you! 

So what's the actual purpose
Of my life experience? 
To keep my thoughts in motion
While I'm sitting on this fence? 
I wish I had the energy
To finish up with flair, 
When all is said and done I guess.
You wager what you dare.







When all the others were away at Mass
I was all hers as we peeled potatoes.
They broke the silence, let fall one by one
Like solder weeping off the soldering iron:
Cold comforts set between us, things to share
Gleaming in a bucket of clean water.
And again let fall. Little pleasant splashes
From each other's work would bring us to our senses.

So while the parish priest at her bedside
Went hammer and tongs at the prayers for the dying
And some were responding and some crying
I remembered her head bent towards my head,
Her breath in mine, our fluent dipping knives-
Never closer the whole rest of our lives. 

When are you coming? When are you coming, dear? 
From the sweet laughters and fragile smiles
Of the dark sunny face, and hidden looks in between
The eyes of yours -  From the places of the lions and the snakes, 
From the jungles that do not acquaint with the wind that shakes. 


Lunar nights and fiery fights.  Days; 
They went by like the train on the subway lines: 
High steeps, low steeps.  Just for the sake
Of a bunch of roses.  Not a garden, not a reed bed -
Only for a bunch of roses.

Time is a kind friend, my friend, 
My mistress, my angel.  And my heart
Could only weep when I was walking
Towards the shadow of my light.

Ah! Now I see! The scene that I -
I wasn't able to see.  And my mind; 
It was trapped by two I's and
The eyes of Miss Fiery Lunar Blind.

Why would it flow and grow
Like a champagne meeting the sun
Behind a curtain-less mirror-like
Window, watching me endlessly as a widow.

The deepness of the dark blue sea -
She sees that You are coming. 
Ah! Now I see that time is a kind friend, 
For you are coming dear. You Are Coming. 


 
 

Cowlick Billy
always runs
up the alley
down the street
sniffing things
on hamster feet.
No one knows 
why Billy runs
up the alley
down the street, 
hours on end, 
sun or sleet, 
and no one cares
even though
when Billy stops
to take a leak
schoolmates ask 
shy Billy why 
he's always laughing
when he runs
and Billy smiles
and almost says
goodness gracious
don't you know
things are sour
things are sweet 
up the alley
down the street. 


This is the way that autumn came to the trees: 
it stripped them down to the skin, 
left their ebony bodies naked.
It shook out their hearts, the yellow leaves, 
scattered them over the ground.
Anyone could trample them out of shape
undisturbed by a single moan of protest.

The birds that herald dreams
were exiled from their song, 
each voice torn out of its throat.
They dropped into the dust
even before the hunter strung his bow.

Bless these withered bodies
with the passion of your resurrection; 
make their dead veins flow with blood again.

Give some tree the gift of green again.
Let one bird sing. 


When  Buddha  woke  up

         As  bats, owls  screeched  in  banyan  trees, 
         Right  inside  the  palace, a  young  man  woke  up-
         To  his  right, his  wife and  children  asleep.
         Thought  the young  man  ‘ Why  should  mankind  suffer? '
         With  disease, old  age, death-endless sufferings..? 
         Who has solution?  And  who'll  save  sick  mankind? 
         Left  the  rich  palace, his  wife, children, riches and all.
         Walked  away  far, this  man, found  a  peepul  tree, 
         Sat  under it. Closed  his  eyes  to  meditate  
         to  find  medicine  for  mankind's  diseases.
         Till  one day, light  dawned  upon  him. Wisdom  came.
         Thus, mankind  saved.   


	              - - -Children only kneel when some incident causes great fear
Children only cry when they feel alone and threatened
Children live by a strong faith that is scare these days
Children will bare any type of pain if they feel it will ease the hate
And those times when children pray those times are when god can do nothing but, obey
Children the ask for happiness and they are the light of day
Yet we let millions of these treasures starve for attention
Children look at war but, look away
Its times like these when children prayers save the day
In this world of lost souls what more could one wish for than just pure hope
They are bright as stars that glitter
And all they shed is grace
With sticky fingers from exploring the juices mother earth bares
And their innocence laying bare
And simple truths spew from their rosy lips
Children pray but only when they can feel the end is near
And their love is a sudden rush that only causes forgiveness
Perfect smiles they wear upon their face
And children never hold any disgrace
Light shallow dreams of making the world a better place
When children kneel that is for which they will pray
Children only pray when in doubt
And their voices portray light fears
All a child wants to see is the new day break
And when that thought is threatened children kneel and pray


When coldness wraps this suffering clay,
Ah! whither strays the immortal mind?
It cannot die, it cannot stay,
But leaves its darken'd dust behind.
Then, unembodied, doth it trace
By steps each planet's heavenly way?
Or fill at once the realms of space,
A thing of eyes, that all survey?

Eternal, boundless, undecay'd,
A thought unseen, but seeing all,
All, all in earth or skies display'd,
Shall it survey, shall it recall:
Each fainter trace that memory holds
So darkly of departed years,
In one broad glance the soul beholds,
And all, that was, at once appears.

Before Creation peopled earth,
Its eye shall roll through chaos back;
And where the farthest heaven had birth,
The spirit trace its rising track.
And where the future mars or makes,
Its glance dilate o'er all to be,
While sun is quench'd or system breaks,
Fix'd in its own eternity.

Above or Love, Hope, Hate, or Fear,
It lives all passionless and pure:
An age shall fleet like earthly year;
Its years as moments shall endure.
Away, away, without a wing,
O'er all, through all, its thought shall fly,
A nameless and eternal thing,
Forgetting what it was to die. 

When confronting and experiencing tough times, 
That’s when you know who your friends are.
When you are broke with no dollars, no dimes; 
When you are struggling, fighting an internal war; 
That’s when you know the true meaning
Of family members:  brothers and sisters.


When you’re facing judge, jury and a calamity of rumors; 
When alone at night, you’re trying to avert disasters; 
Fighting the system and standing like a nerd, in the ring, 
In front of a raging bull or a prowling tiger, which can wring
Your neck and eat your soul; annihilate you in a matter of a second; 
You feel weak and wet; you’re being tossed in a pond
Infested of alligators, snakes and other predators, 
Hell is your destination; you see no light of hope; 
You are caput and done; forget about dope, 
It can compound the problems; the creatures, 
Around you, seem to be alive and real; 
You cannot breathe comfortably, you feel
That you are dead, discouraged to fight the war; 
That’s when you know who your friends are.

When you are broke, with no dollars, no dimes, 
When confronting and experiencing tough times, 
That’s when you know who your relatives are. 


When  crystal  hearts  are  broken
You  cannot  make  repair.
The  warmth  and  love  you  cherished
Turns  then,  to  cold  despair.

Its  pieces  of  love  shattered; 
Though  small,  shall  sparkle  still.
So  gather  them  as  treasures
And  keep  them,  if  you  will.

For  crystal  hearts  when  broken; 
Though  shattered  and  no  more, 
Are  treasured  for  their  beauty
Displayed  to  you  before.

The  pieces,  just  remember, 
Though  sometimes  hid  away; 
Still  sparkle  like  a  treasure
When  they're  put  on  display.

The  world  should  see  such  treasures
Because  they're  oh  so  rare.
Crystal  hearts  add  value
To  lives  of  cold  despair.

And  crystal,  when  it  sparkles  
In  whole,  or  just  in  part; 
Still  is,  of  all  its  vessels, 
True  love's  most  favored  heart. 


If the day is done, 
if birds sing no more, 
if the wind has flagged tired, 
then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me, 
even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep 
and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk. 

From the traveler, 
whose sack of provisions is empty before the voyage is ended, 
whose garment is torn and dust-laden, 
whose strength is exhausted, 
remove shame and poverty, 
and renew his life like a flower under the cover of thy kindly night. 


Death comes slowly
In silence
And pause at the door
No one hears it
Only the one who knows
Feels it
His door is knocked
Though he may be
Surrounded by 
Near and dear ones
Or 
May be all alone. 

When Death come Knocking 
And speaks in silence
All set to go, dear. 
Don't take anything
With you
Leave your body and 
Everything here.
But.
Take out your  soul 
From 
Deep within.
Come with me Soul
Let's fly away from here
Heavens door is waiting
To welcome you dear.

When death comes knocking
Only once in lifetime, 
Whether you want or not, 
It can enter anywhere and anytime.
Its his choice
To whom 
He should knock.
I don't know
When I will be his choice
Am waiting for him dearly! 




Death continues to shock us
Death will not stop striking us
It is a natural phenomenon
It is a sad oxymoron
When death comes without invitation
The only option is to welcome her
Without words, with pleasure, and resignation
When she strikes, we put out head together
To deal with the unknown and our past
We think about our own fate
About our ultimate date
About our loved ones, who have passed
And we become unnecessarily upset, mad
Disoriented, helpless, hopeless, and sad
When death strikes, things become crazy
We lose it for awhile, we become unhappy
It is not a pretty thing
When one can do nothing
About something.


when eagles fly 
up in the sky
that is when he wonders why.

When eagles Fly 
is when  bad timez say good-bye
when eagles fly 
we always thank to say hi! 

when eagles fly
up that high
I know they are saying bye.
when eagles fly! 


WHEN first I came here I had hope, 
Hope for I knew not what. Fast beat 
My heart at the sight of the tall slope 
Or grass and yews, as if my feet 

Only by scaling its steps of chalk 
Would see something no other hill 
Ever disclosed. And now I walk 
Down it the last time. Never will 

My heart beat so again at sight 
Of any hill although as fair 
And loftier. For infinite 
The change, late unperceived, this year, 

The twelfth, suddenly, shows me plain. 
Hope now,--not health nor cheerfulness, 
Since they can come and go again, 
As often one brief hour witnesses,-- 

Just hope has gone forever. Perhaps 
I may love other hills yet more 
Than this: the future and the maps 
Hide something I was waiting for. 

One thing I know, that love with chance 
And use and time and necessity 
Will grow, and louder the heart's dance 
At parting than at meeting be. 

When fishes set umbrellas up 
If the rain-drops run, 
Lizards will want their parasols 
To shade them from the sun. 


Intermittent tears
Unbelievable fears
When a friend is suffering, a real friend
Must be willing to extend a helping hand
Cry on my shoulders, my sisters
Cry on my shoulders, my brothers
I’m crying, weeping with you
Because I am hurt too
I’m suffering with you
Because I’m in pain too
Cry on my shoulders, my brothers
Cry on my shoulders, my sisters
Be strong and have hope
Be not afraid to climb the rope
Of life, and to ride daily the roller-coaster
I am with you, please calm your anger
Do not give-up on tomorrow
I understand your sorrow
I am with you all the way
I want to be by you everyday
Let’s stop the tears
Let’s conquer all fears
Be courageous, let’s sing
Like the birds instead of crying
A better tomorrow is coming
Ignore the clouds for the moment
Be strong and adamant
On doing good deeds
Let’s water the seeds
In a matter of time
Let’s stop crying and weeping
In spite of the suffering
It’s not worth a dime
To be miserable and depressed
Regardless, we are lucky and blessed
Come laugh on my shoulder, my brother
Come laugh on my shoulder, my sister
I understand your pain
Let’s stop crying in vain
A brother is extending his hand
So you won’t sink in the quick sand. 


When frustration take position in driver’s sit, 
Will not grant peace even thousands candles lit, 
Peace and harmony are true essence and very fit, 
Moral may lie very low when disturbances hit, 

People may have distrust and look suspicious, 
Earnest peace efforts may remain continuous, 
When gravity of situation remain high and explosive, 
Even mighty and might may not remain responsive, 

Whole life time’s great work and achievement’s, 
Will be on vane if not proper or no movements, 
Slight error in judgment may turn events, 
Solid material upon hit may find some dents, 

Wrong notion and faulty planning, 
Will be like railway crossing without manning, 
You can’t hide face or runaway from the scene, 
Your work may speak and deeds also seen, 

Any mad man may come and fire point blank, 
Never expose weakness but with the words thank, 
You may not survive and meet death, 
People may shed tears and offer wreath, 

You may meet the challenge and go down, 
Life may be lost and position without crown, 
Name will be inscribed on marble plate, 
Alas! That will last journey along with fate, 

We have faced loss of lives with senior leaders, 
High tributes paid and honoured by readers, 
But who will come forward and strongly plead, 
It will not be what you "did" but what were: "deeds


 As we cross that gulf so wide,
 As our soul will there abide.
 We'll see beauty all around,
 Our loved ones, too, will greet us,
 As we leave this earth behind.
 There'll be singing angels there,
 The awesome peace and joyfulness
 Will permeate the air.
 And His Light takes place of day,
 As the ones who found "The Way

"When great trees fall,
rocks on distant hills shudder,
lions hunker down
in tall grasses,
and even elephants
lumber after safety.

When great trees fall
in forests,
small things recoil into silence,
their senses
eroded beyond fear.

When great souls die,
the air around us becomes
light, rare, sterile.
We breathe, briefly.
Our eyes, briefly,
see with
a hurtful clarity.
Our memory, suddenly sharpened,
examines,
gnaws on kind words
unsaid,
promised walks
never taken.

Great souls die and
our reality, bound to
them, takes leave of us.
Our souls,
dependent upon their
nurture,
now shrink, wizened.
Our minds, formed
and informed by their
radiance,
fall away.
We are not so much maddened
as reduced to the unutterable ignorance
of dark, cold
caves.

And when great souls die,
after a period peace blooms,
slowly and always
irregularly.  Spaces fill
with a kind of
soothing electric vibration.
Our senses, restored, never
to be the same, whisper to us.
They existed.  They existed.
We can be.  Be and be
better.  For they existed. 

When Greed Outstrips Needs (A Rondel of lines) 

When outstripped are our needs by Greed
Or love of Fame our still outweighs, 
We rush along on mirky ways; 
All moral laws we cease to heed.

Traffic signals failing to read, 
At break-neck speed our aims we chase, 
When outstripped are our needs by Greed
Or love of Fame our skill outweighs.

To harming others should this lead, 
So what?  For Fame so strong our craze, 
The banner 'buy or bribe' we raise! 
We mind not making others bleed, 
When outstripped are our needs by Greed. 

WE have cried in our despair
That men desert,
For some trivial affair
Or noisy, insolent sport,
Beauty that we have won
From bitterest hours;
Yet we, had we walked within
Those topless towers
Where Helen waked with her boy,
Had given but as the rest
Of the men and women of Troy,
A word and a jest. 

When I am dead, my dearest,
Sing no sad songs for me;
Plant thou no roses at my head,
Nor shady cypress tree:
Be the green grass above me
With showers and dewdrops wet;
And if thou wilt, remember,
And if thou wilt, forget.

I shall not see the shadows,
I shall not feel the rain;
I shall not hear the nightingale
Sing on, as if in pain:
And dreaming through the twilight
That doth not rise nor set,
Haply I may remember,
And haply may forget



When I came in front of the national poet's statue, the florist showed me her breasts,  a lost dog was crossing the street obeying the traffic lights, and the windows of the central library fled off in the world.
The pollen is an ambiguous mister, speaking a blue language of which she understands only the verbs at past tense. 

To play tag with my two little brothers on sunny days
When they plead with that sweet dew-dropp look in their eyes

To chase them gleefully around the field
Without my breath coming in short little gasps within minutes

I want to play basketball and 
Football and
Tennis and
Baseball and
Ultimate Frisbee
For a period of time longer than five minutes

To score in the court, in the field, 
To have the ball passed to me because I can be trusted with it

I want to feel the wind in my hair, 
To feel the ground falling away beneath my feet

I wait.
For doctor’s appointments and speech therapy sessions.

I wait until  I learn the breathing exercises and 
Until I get my reflux that causes my breathing issue under control

I wait to breath freely for the first time in my remembered life; 
I want to be able to live without bodily constraints. 





I know you’re far away but I don’t know where; 
I’ve been longing you every pieces of me; 
I’ve been waiting which I don’t know would come; 
And I’ve been saving my all just for you; 
I always wishing for the moment to arrive; 
That someday I would found you in front of my eyes; 
That you would be with me for always; 
That you would hold my hands forever; 
And you would help me count those stars; 
To the dark nights until the morning shines; 
That what I really am, deeply; 
Though your far and May not come; 
I will always be here, the same; 
Though you may not know who I am; 
Yet, I’ve seen you when I close my eyes;


Allowing the tinkling
Romance to dance
Ethereally into eternity

Fingers floating, 
Caressing spells
Across those ancient ivories
With the inspiration of Chopin

My mood no longer
Entrenched in worldly

Only
Gentleness
T ickling my soul
Royal peacock feathers
Flirting
And
Charming
In fullest delight

Sipping
Champagne’s 
Sweetest bouquet
Inebriating 
Lover’s paired - hearts

A shower
Of purest

When I die
My body will go to science
Where novice students can marvel
At how I lived without a heart


When I close my eyes
for the last time 
I want to have lived, 
really lived.

I want to know I've tasted 
the smorgasbord of life.
I want to have relished the good
and spat the bad back out, 
knowing at least I tried it.

When I'm done here, 
I don't want to wonder
if someone caught
the kiss I threw, 
I'll know.

I don't want to leave
with a heart as empty 
as my pockets.

I want to know without a doubt
I've left something of me behind, 
something that's good, not regret
for never making a difference.

When I close my eyes 
for the last time, 
I would like someone to remember
.  I was here. 

when I first met you I already knew, 
When I first met you the sky was so blue.
When I first met you my eyes were only set on you.
when I first met I was feeling so bad, 
that was only because I had a fight with my dad.

When I first met you, you said come with me, 
when I first met you I fill so so free.
When I first met you my heart was filled with glee, 
when I first met you we played whoopy.

When I first met you you already knew, 
When I first met my mind was set only on you.
when I first met you I said got to go, 
But hey we are now together what do you know, 
When I first met you! ! 

When I first put this uniform on,
I said, as I looked in the glass,
"It's one to a million
That any civilian
My figure and form will surpass.
Gold lace has a charm for the fair,
And I've plenty of that, and to spare,
While a lover's professions,
When uttered in Hessians,
Are eloquent everywhere!"
A fact that I counted upon,
When I first put this uniform on!

I said, when I first put it on,
"It is plain to the veriest dunce
That every beauty
Will feel it her duty
To yield to its glamour at once.
They will see that I'm freely gold-laced
In a uniform handsome and chaste" -
But the peripatetics
Of long-haired aesthetics,
Are very much more to their taste -
Which I never counted upon
When I first put this uniform on

I really feel it’s a pity
I have to live in a city.
I feel a sense of unrest
And discontent.

The sensory distractions, 
So called attractions
Cause  a feeling of fatigue
And a sense of ennui.

When I fly so high
I hear myself sigh, 
And the white clouds drifting by
In the azure sky
Fill me with peace.
And put my frayed nerves at ease.

With my eyes glued to the outside view, 
And distractions a few, 
I forget I am in a plane.
After long i feel  sane.
The clear blue and white
At t height, 
Away from the monotonous daily grind 
Is just what I needed to declutter my mind.
Though there are people around
But i am blissfully unaware of all the sounds.
I wish I could alight
And join the clouds in their flight. 

Kabir:
My mind was soothed
When I found the boundless knowledge,
And the fires
     that scorch the world
To me are water cool. 

WHEN I go alone at night to my love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind does not stir, the houses on both sides of the street stand silent.
It is my own anklets that grow loud at every step and I am ashamed.

When I sit on my balcony and listen for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle on the trees, and the water is still in the river like the sword on the knees of a sentry fallen asleep.
It is my own heart that beats wildly -- I do not know how to quiet it.

When my love comes and sits by my side, when my body trembles and my eyelids droop, the night darkens, the wind blows out the lamp, and the clouds draw veils over the stars.
It is the jewel at my own breast that shines and gives light. I do not know how to hide it. 


When I have fears that I may cease to be 
         Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,
     Before high-piled books, in charactery,
         Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain; 
     When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,
         Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
     And think that I may never live to trace
         Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance; 
     And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
         That I shall never look upon thee more,
     Never have relish in the faery power
         Of unreflecting love; - then on the shore
     Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
     Till love and fame to nothingness do sink. 


When I kneel down to pray
My both hands are stretched out wide
and my eyes are closed when I pray for Him
therefore, I have no fear when I am close to you
unless they are prayed
therefore, I have no strifes when I pray of you 
therefore, I have no worries when I follow your precious precepts
therefore, I have no loneliness when I am under your shelter
therefore, I have no more tears rolling on my eyes
therefore, I have no fail in my life when I choose your path to live. 


When I Let You In, 
 I Loved You, 
More Than The The Sun Loves The Moon.

When I Stayed With You, 
I Gave To You, 
My Hands For Comfort and Heart for Help.

When I Kissed You, 
I Close My Eyes, 
And Let My Foot Pop Up Like A Little Girl.

When I Protected You, 
I Meant What I Said, 
And Smiled When I Got Into the Mess.

When I Swayed With You, 
My Eyes Stayed On You, 
And counted the twinkle in your eyes.

When I was part' From You, 
My Mind was on you, 
and the memories we had.

When I Loved You, 
I Let You In, 
and you came.

When I Loved You More, 
You stole from me, 
And Left.

When I Watched You Leave, 
I Broke, 
The Crumbling Dust Still Haunting You. 

When I lie here safe in your warm arms
Defenseless at the mercy of your charms
A weakling I turn staring into your eyes
I lose my strength in this new paradise

This paradise of encircling warmth I love
For it’s cool as the rainfall from above
That falls upon my skin and makes it shine
Knowing that you’re always mine and fine

When I lie here safe in your strong arm
Though I’m weak but I’m safe from harm
I feel my bones turn into water and flow
My dead feelings gently kindle and glow

This glowing feeling compares to the galaxy
For it always brings me closer to sweet ecstasy
When I lie here safe in your soothing arms
Boneless, defenseless at your irresistible charms


When I look at your eyes, my mind engulf with love
Your eyes show me the love that showers for me
Your eyes show me the affection that longs for me
Your eyes show me the care that needs for me
My tears stop when I look at your eyes 
My worries go away when I look at your eyes
My pains vanish when I look at your eyes
I can see the truth of love that lies on your eyes
I can see the faith of soul that holds on your eyes
I can see the warm of life that lives on your eyes
Let me see my love through your eyes and this will
make me feel that my life with you is great for ever. 

When I love
I feel that I am the king of time
I possess the earth and everything on it
and ride into the sun upon my horse.

When I love
I become liquid light
invisible to the eye
and the poems in my notebooks
become fields of mimosa and poppy.

When I love
the water gushes from my fingers
grass grows on my tongue
when I love
I become time outside all time.

When I love a woman
all the trees
run barefoot toward me-When I love you
A new language springs up,
New cities, new countries discovered.
The hours breathe like puppies,
Wheat grows between the pages of books,
Birds fly from your eyes with tiding of honey,
Caravans ride from your breasts carrying Indian herbs,
The mangoes fall all around, the forests catch fire
And Nubian drums beat.

When I love you your breasts shake off their shame,
Turn into lightning and thunder, a sword, a sandy storm.
When I love you the Arab cities leap up and demonstrate
Against the ages of repression
And the ages
Of revenge against the laws of the tribe.
And I, when I love you,
March against ugliness,
Against the kings of salt,
Against the institutionalization of the desert.
And I shall continue to love you until the world flood arrives;
I shall continue to love you untill the world flood arrives.


When I’m killed, don’t think of me
Buried there in Cambrin Wood,
Nor as in Zion think of me
With the Intolerable Good.
And there’s one thing that I know well,
I’m damned if I’ll be damned to Hell!

So when I’m killed, don’t wait for me,
Walking the dim corridor;
In Heaven or Hell, don’t wait for me,
Or you must wait for evermore.
You’ll find me buried, living-dead
In these verses that you’ve read.

So when I’m killed, don’t mourn for me,
Shot, poor lad, so bold and young,
Killed and gone — don’t mourn for me.
On your lips my life is hung:
O friends and lovers, you can save
Your playfellow from the grave. 


I hope your hands  
will always be for
me to hold.
And, if they are 
a trifle sweaty, 
would you mind
to overlook 
this sign of
rampant joy? 

I hope your eyes
will always be for
me to love.
And, if they shed
a few shy tears, 
so would you mind 
 I kissed them all away? 

I hope your ears
will always be for
my own words.
And if they're  sparse
at times or casual
would you mind
me whispering
sweet nothings -
all day and night? 

I hope your smile
will always be
just waiting
to shine on me
with love
and tenderness.
And would you mind
to save your smile
when I am sleeping
for morning glory? 

I hope your lips
will always be
just waiting, 
for kisses that 
sing songs
of love for me.
And if I hurry
out the door
still chewing brekkie, 
I hope you'll  
want to: 
look into my eyes, 
talk into my ears, 
hold my calloused hands
and kiss me
'til I melt. 


I glanced at her and took my glasses
off--they were still singing. They buzzed
like a locust on the coffee table and then
ceased. Her voice belled forth, and the
sunlight bent. I felt the ceiling arch, and
knew that nails up there took a new grip
on whatever they touched. "I am your own
way of looking at things," she said. "When
you allow me to live with you, every
glance at the world around you will be
a sort of salvation


" And I took her hand. 

When I met you
You said you were fine
Right then and there I knew you was mine.

When I first met you
Everything was great, 
Then I left that dance ten minutes late
Thinking that you were my mate

Then when i called you it was late
But you said it was fine
That you would be mine
Then in the nick of time
I found a dime
Now this is the end of my rhyme. 


When I need the sense of belonging
To help me cross the chasm
To fill energy into the dumb brain's
sleeping energies
The lightening blaze that sheers through.  .
I build a tent
In the back of my brain
And crawl into it
Here I cover the antiques of past
Well brushed to its shine
For In it I see the face
Of the girl
I lost along the way
Up the winding path.
I blush at my ignorance
I stammer as words rush
then on second thoughts
Fall silent. 
As I continue to gaze the stars
Counting my blessings
one by one
Till a grateful heart
wakes up from its slumber
Is it true? 
Do you really exist? 
If so; show me the  winding path
That will prick my senses
Add the joyous smile
To your lips.  . 

and I finally reach you.  


When I roved a young Highlander o'er the dark heath,
And climb'd thy steep sumrnit, oh Morven of snow!
To gaze on the torrent that thunder'd beneath,
Or the mist of the tempest that gather'd below,
Untutor'd by science, a stranger to fear, 
And rude as the rocks where my infancy grew,
No feeling, save one, to my bosom was dear
Need I say, my sweet Mary, 'twas centred in you?

Yet it could not be love, for I knew not the name,- 
What passion can dwell in the heart of a child?
But still I pereceive an emotion the same 
As I felt, when a boy, on the crag cover'd wild:
One image alone on my bosom impress'd 
I loved my bleak regions, nor panted for new;
And few were my wants, for my wishes were bless'd;
And pure were my thoughts, for my soul was with you.

I arose with the dawn; with my dog as my guide,
From mountain to mountain I bounded along
I breasted the billows of Dee's rushing tide,
And heard at a distance the Highlander's song:
At eve, on my heath-cover'd couch of repose,
No dreams, save of Mary, were spread to my view;
And warm to the skies my devotions aoose, 
For the first of my prayers was a blessing on you.

I left my bleak home, and my visions are gone;
The mountains are vanish'd, my youth is no more;
As the last of my race, I must wither alone, 
And delight but in days I have witness'd before:
Ah! splendour has raised but embitter'd my lot;
More dear were the scenes which my infancy knew:
Though my hopes may have fail'd, yet they are not forgot;
Though cold is my heart, still it lingers with you.

When I see some dark hill point its crest to the sky,
I think of the rocks that o'ershadow Colbleen
When I see the soft blue of a love-speaking eye
I think of those eyes that endear'd the rude scene;
When, haply, some light-waving locks I behold,
That faintly resemble my Mary's in hue, 
I think on the long, flowing ringlets of gold,
The locks that were sacred to beauty, and you.

Yet the day may arrive when the mountains once more
Shall rise to my sight In their mantles of snow:
But while these soar above me, unchanged as before
Will Mary be there to receive me? - ah, no!
Adieu, then, ye hills, where my childhood was bred!
Thou sweet flowing Dee, to thy waters adieu!
No home in the forest shall shelter my head,--
Ah! Mary, what home could be mine but with you

When I saw you I imagine
Life is sunshine
you are dense shadow

Today once again my heart longed for
Today once again I pacified my heart

When you are gone, left me thinking
What I lost and what I gained

Why did the time sang the song
Which I cannot hum a while? 



I saw you with your friends
But you never saw me.

When I see you, the world ain't there
I only see you and me
That smile of yours makes me melt.

When I see you, I feel special
Because you looked my way
And I felt noticed.

When I see you, it's just you and me
You make my world light up
I would do anything for you.

When I see you,  I have a smile like no other
I get butterflies in my stomach
And the world knows I'm happy

And it's all because of

When I see you


My heart beat stops inside my soul 
When I see your tears falling from your eyes 
Your tears burn my heart with your bitter words 
and your weeping wound brings me sorrowful world 
You need healing for your weeping wound that's pain you 
and I am here to give you relieve from your pain with my love 
Like the cloud caressing an innocent bird in the sky 
I will hold you tight in my heart and wipe your tears with love 
Weep not my love, for my heart will fall away from my soul 
When I look at your tears then I make you comfortable 
and when I am alone then I think of your tears and cry 
Your heart may have many reasons to cry and feel sad 
but my heart is for you to find the happy words to tell you 
I love you so much and you know that I do 
Let make your tears of joy in my eyes with understanding love 
and allow me to feel the passion of love on your lips 
You mean the world to me, love you for ever



your hair 
was in shining disarray

your features
soft and sleepy

your mouth
a smile of contentment

and your contours 
molded by the sheet.

I kissed you lightly
said 'have a good day'
and you purred 'mmmmm.'

Now at work I dream you'd call: 

'Tell them that I need you home
and wait for me outside.'

Then all would be
intensified, slowed down—

your driving 
while you held me in your eyes

our moving
from the car inside
 
and the click that's followed  
by the music of Jobim— 
a cue for me to dance with you. 


Twas  once  upon  a  time  I  stood
           Nearby  the  sounding  sea.
           By  the  man, who  loved  the  maiden.
           Beautiful, Annabel  Lee.

           As  he  spoke  then, my  sorrow  welled.
           And  likewise  did  the  sea.
           It  seemed  that  even  Neptune  sighed.
           And  welled;  wept  both  wind  and  lee.

           And  that  was  well, for  each  of  us
           Now  yearned  and  wept  as  three.
           For  all  the  maidens  men  have  loved
           In  such  kingdoms  by  the  sea.

           And  so  that  evening  as  I  stood; 
           Just  Neptune, Poe, and  me.
           I  spied  a  spirit  maiden  wrapped
           In  a  gown  blown  loose  and  free.

           The  spectre  heard  our  mournful  wail
           Like  sirens  by  the  sea.
           And  drifted  by  and  wondered  at
           Such  sad, sorrowed  souls  as  we.

           He  looked, and  then  Poe  saw  her  eyes.
           As  Neptune  did, and  me.
           The  same  he  saw  so  long  ago
           In  a  kingdom  by  the  sea.

           He  stretched  his  arms, and  she  stretched  hers; 
           As  Neptune's  arms  gripped  me.
           And  as  we  cried, she  took  him  up.
           Both  then, as  if  one, you  see.

           Then  Neptune's  trident  pointed  out
           The  way  for  Poe  and  she.
           And  those  three  drifted  up  and  off
           This  cliff, by  the  sounding  sea.

           The  last  I  saw,  as  I  stood  still
           And  felt  the  wind  blow  free; 
           The  maiden  that  Poe  dearly  loved
           From  that  kingdom  by  the  sea.

           She  turned  her  head  and  cast  her  eyes 
           And  smiled  a  smile  at  me.
           Twas  then  I  knew, she'd  take  me  too; 
           This  soul, called  Annabel  Lee. 


There will be a time when it will end. 
Be it parting 
Be it death 
So each passing minute with you 
                       Pendulummed with sadness. 
So many times 
I looked long into your face. 
                      I could hear the clock ticking. 

When I think about myself, 
I almost laugh myself to death, 
My life has been one great big joke, 
A dance that's walked 
A song that's spoke, 
I laugh so hard I almost choke 
When I think about myself.

Sixty years in these folks' world 
The child I works for calls me girl 
I say 'Yes ma'am' for working's sake. 
Too proud to bend 
Too poor to break, 
I laugh until my stomach ache, 
When I think about myself.

My folks can make me split my side, 
I laughed so hard I nearly died, 
The tales they tell, sound just like lying, 
They grow the fruit, 
But eat the rind, 
I laugh until I start to crying, 
When I think about my folks. 

when I think of you i feel brand new
when i think of you i feel you thinking of me too
when i think of you i never catch the flu
when i think of you it helps me through
when i think of you i wished you were here with me 
when i think of you i wished you could see
when I think of you i hate to be alone at sea.
when i think of you you'll just see.



When I think of you, 
I think of hearts in mind, 
Then I see skies of blue, 
But never can I find mine.

Then clouds of grey follow me, 
Around corners, and in bins, 
But sometimes it frightens thee, 
I wished I had fins, 
When I think of you, I never want to flee.

When I think of you! 

When I too long have looked upon your face, 
Wherein for me a brightness unobscured 
Save by the mists of brightness has its place, 
And terrible beauty not to be endured, 
I turn away reluctant from your light, 
And stand irresolute, a mind undone, 
A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight 
From having looked too long upon the sun. 
Then is my daily life a narrow room 
In which a little while, uncertainly, 
Surrounded by impenetrable gloom, 
Among familiar things grown strange to me 
Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark, 
Till I become accustomed to the dark. 


When I wake up every morning
I always watch you for a while
Then I kiss you very lightly, 
Watch you lips turn to a smile.

Then you ask me what the time is 
And I whisper in your ear
That the hour hardly matters
When you're lying warm and near.

Your smile grows slightly wider, 
But you turn your face away, 
Hide your head under the pillow, 
Try to cheat the break of day.

Your hair wisps round about you, 
Flows like water to your hips, 
But your neck soon bare before me
Feels the pressure of my lips.

Then I touch you very lightly, 
Run my fingers down your spine, 
And your body gently waking
Turns till eyes gaze into mine.

And in that very moment, 
As your mouth seeks to entice, 
When I wake up every morning, 
I am lost in paradise.


When I walk alone, I think of you my love
When I walk alone, I walk with broken heart
When I walk alone, I walk with sadness
When I walk alone, I walk with my silent tears
When I walk alone, I walk with my sorrow
When I walk alone, I walk with my sad memories
When I walk alone, I walk with my shattered dream
When I walk alone, I walk with my hands lifeless
Love never walk alone but you made me walk alone
You promised me that you will walk with me forever
but you made me walk alone with my tears forever
When the heaven stolen you from me yesterday
All your promises are gone with the wind
Today, You made me walk alone with out you my love
and I promise you, I will walk alone till my journey ends


When I walk in the rain
Then I praise the nature for her goodness
I can see the tree leaves turning green like grass
I can see the flowers with bright colours
I can see the barren land gets wet with water

When I walk in the rain
Then I hear the roaring sound of thunder and lightening 
I can see all birds on the trees sit quietly
I can see no animals on the road walking 
I can see all the ponds gets filled with rain water

When I walk in the rain 
Then I listen the wind whistling like a melody
I can see all the trees dance to the tune of wind
I can see the rain water rushes down to the stream violently
I can see all the farmers are happy with their gain. 

The second time I lived on earth
Was several hundred years ago;
And—royal by my second birth—
I know as much as most men know.
I was a king who held the reins
As never modern monarch can;
I was a king, and I had brains,
And, what was more, I was a man! 
Called to the throne in stormy times,
When things were at their very worst,
I had to fight—and not with rhymes—
My own self and my kindred first;
And after that my friends and foes,
And great abuses born of greed;
And when I’d fairly conquered those,
I ruled the land a king indeed. 


I found a deal of rottenness,
Such as in modern towns we find;
I camped my poor in palaces
And tents upon the plain behind.
I marked the hovels, dens and drums
In that fair city by the sea.
And burnt the miles of wretched slums
And built the homes as they should be. 

I stripped the baubles from the State,
And on the land I spent the spoil;
I hunted off the sullen great,
And to the farmers gave the soil.
My people were their own police;
My courts were free to everyone.
My priests were to preach love and peace;
My Judges to see justice done. 

I’d studied men and studied kings,
No crawling cant would I allow;
I hated mean and paltry things,
As I can hate them even now.
A land of men I meant to see,
A strong and clean and noble race—
No subject dared kneel down to me,
But looked his king straight in the face 

Had I not been a king in fact,
A king in council-hall and tent,
I might have let them crawl and act
The courtier to their heart’s content;
But when I called on other kings,
And saw men kneel, I felt inclined
To gently tip the abject things
And kick them very hard behind. 

My subjects were not slaves, I guess,
But though the women in one thing—
A question ’twas of healthy dress—
Would dare to argue with their king
(I had to give in there, I own,
Though none denied that I was strong),
Yet they would hear my telephone
If anything went very wrong. 

I also had some poets bright—
Their songs were grand, I will allow—
They were, if I remember right,
About as bad as bards are now.
I had to give them best at last,
And let them booze and let them sing;
As it is now, so in the past,
They’d small respect for gods or king. 

I loved to wander through the streets—
I carried neither sword nor dirk—
And watch the building of my fleets,
And watch my artisans at work.
At times I would take off my coat
And show them how to do a thing—
Till someone, clucking in his throat,
Would stare and gasp, ‘It is the king!’ 

And I would say, ‘Shut up, you fools!
Is it for this my towns I burn?
You don’t know how to handle tools,
And by my faith you’ll have to learn!’
I was a king, but what of that?
A king may warble in the spring
And carry eggs home in his hat,
Provided that he is a king. 

I loved to stroll about the town
With chums at night, and talk of things,
And, though I chanced to wear the crown,
My friends, by intellect, were kings.
When I was doubtful, then I might
Discuss a matter quietly,
But when I felt that I was right
No power on earth could alter me! 

And now and then it was no sin
Nor folly to relax a bit—
I’d take my friends into an inn
And call for wine and pay for it.
And then of many things we’d clack
With loosened tongues and visions clear—
I often heard behind my back
The whispered ‘Peace, the king is here!’ 

I knew they longed to have a court
And flaunt their feathers on the scene,
But hitherto I’d held the fort.
My subjects wanted me, no doubt,
To give the throne a son and heir—
(There were some little kings about,
But that was neither here nor there). 

I’d no occasion for a wife—
I’d seen a lot of married life—
My sire had been a married man.
‘A son and heir be hanged!’ I said—
‘How dare you ask for such a thing,
‘You fight it out when I am dead
‘And let the best man be the king!’ 

‘Your Majesty, we love you well!’
A candid friend would say to me—
‘But there be tales that people tell
‘Unfitted to thy dignity’—
‘My dignity be damned!’ I’d say,
‘Bring me no women’s chattering!
‘I’ll be a man while yet I may—
‘When trouble comes I’ll be a king! 

I’d kept my kingdom clean and strong
While other kingdoms were like ours—
I had no need to brook a wrong,
I feared not all the rotten Powers
I did not eat my heart out then,
Nor feebly fight in verse or prose
I’d take five hundred thousand men
To argue matters with my foes! 

It thrilled me through, the mighty tramp
Of armed men, the thundering cheer—
The pregnant whisper through the camp
At dead of night: ‘The King is here!’
And though we paid for victory
On some fields that were hard to hold,
The faith my soldiers had in me
Oft strengthened mine a hundredfold. 

I’d chat with soldiers by the fires
On rocky heights and river banks,
I’d seek the brains that war requires,
And take my captains from the ranks.
And so, until the storm was by,
And came the peace just war can bring,
I bore me so that men might cry

When I was king the world was wide,
And I was strong and I was free.
I knew no hatred, knew no pride,
No envy and no treachery.
I feared no lies. I feared no truth,
Nor any storm that time might bring.
I had my love, I had my youth,
The world was mine when I was king. 

Peace came at last—and strange is Fate—
The women begged just once alone
To see me robed in royal state
And seated on my father’s throne.
I thought, ‘Shall I this boon deny?’
And said—and ’twas a paltry thing:
‘I’ll show the fools just once that I
‘Can look, as well as be, a king.’ 

They dusted out the castle old,
And from the closet and the chest
They dug the jewels set in gold—
The crown and robes and all the rest.
They came with eyes like stars of night,
With diamonds set in raven hair,
They came with arms and bosoms white—

They dressed me as the kings had been,
The ancient royal purple spread,
She placed the circlet on my head.
They pressed their hearts and bowed to me,
They knelt with arms uplifted all.
I felt the rush of vanity—
The pride that goes before the fall. 


And then the banquet and the wine
With Satan’s music and the glance
Of siren eyes. Those captains mine
Were reeling in the maddening dance:
A finger writing on the wall,
While girls sang as the angels sing—
A drunken boaster in the hall,
The fool that used to be a king. 
I rose again—no matter how—
A woman, and a deeper fall—
I move amongst my people now
The most degraded of them all.
But, if in centuries to come,
I live once more and claim my own,
I’ll see my subjects blind and dumb
Before they set me on a throne


when i was a little baby i crawled and drooled
i was the cutest thing i had everybody fooled
the only time i could make everyone wet
poopoo on  without getting  them all upset
 
when i was a little child i sat on my father's lap
put my lips to the water running from the tap
brought dirty puppies from the street home
believed in fairies, pixies and gnomes
 
when i was a  little child i rode pretty ponies
with dreamy eyes i listen to stories 
i  gently bathed and  carefully dressed my dollies
i smiled and got away with all my follies
 
 when i was a little girl i loved the  green fields
 strong soldiers with armors and shields
 rainbows,  juicy watermelon, hail stones and puddles
wind chimes, baby bums and teddy bears that i could cuddle
 

when i was little girl i would cry for gas balloons
my favorite pink mickey mouse spoon 
cry for the medicines i did have to swallow
the solution for the math problem i couldnt  follow
 
when i was a little girl i believed in god
always anxious for my mother's nod
i believed trees had feelings and cried when cut
there was secret code in every cigarette butt
 
then i got a little sister who cried all night
she followed  me around and we fought alright
we played home and made dresses for our doll
we sure caught each other whenever we did fall
 
now iam all grown up and pretty to see
every time i look across the sea
i see the little girl that was me
making mud cakes happy and free. 


When I was with you
You made me happy
When I was with you
You listened to my stories
When I was with you
You encouraged me to come up
When I was with you
You trusted me a lot
When I was with you
You shared with me everything
When I was with you
You comfort me with nice words
When I was with you 
You complimented me
When I was with you
You cared about my well being
When I was with you
You treated me as a great friend
Even when I am missing you with all of my heart, 
I never forget you




Our days were spent in happiness, although our means were frugal;
We did not sigh for worldly wealth, for vain and tawdry treasures,
We were a simple country pair with simple country pleasures.
Beneath the village chestnut-tree it was our joy to meet once;
We used to tread the dewy fields with wonder-waking feet once;
We wandered once in leafy lanes and walked in Woodlands shady;
But now she's gone to Birmingham to be a Bearded Lady

I loved her as I loved my life when I was young and tender,
And happily our time was spent although our means were slender.
We used to pass the golden days in countrified pursuits once;
We walked through simple country bogs in simple country boots once.
High hopes of happiness I had, but now my hopes are zero,
Alas! My love has left me now to carve her own career O;
Not all the hopes of her I had of her are worth a maravedi;
My love has gone to Birmingham to be a Bearded Lady.

My love now dwells in circus halls with clowns and tight-rope dancers,
Where dromedaries play bassoons and sea-lions do the lancers;
She moves amongst trick-bicyclists, buffoons and comic waiters,
With elephants and acrobats and prestidigitators.
No longer daily by my side she wanders through the hay now,
The glamour of the public eye has lured are far away now.
Remorseless Fates, my tender hopes how cruelly betrayed ye!
My love has gone to Birmingham to be a Bearded Lady.


When I was young and ignorant I loved

But that was e'er she heard the call of Fame's imperious bugle.
I thought her kind as she was fair, but I was green and calfish;
My love, though brighter than a star, was colder than a starfish.
High hopes of happiness I had when I was young and tender;
But time and tide have falsified my juvenile agenda.
My love has gone to Birmingham to be a Bearded Lady. 

When I woke, the town spoke.
Birds and clocks and cross bells
Dinned aside the coiling crowd,
The reptile profligates in a flame,
Spoilers and pokers of sleep,
The next-door sea dispelled
Frogs and satans and woman-luck,
While a man outside with a billhook,
Up to his head in his blood,
Cutting the morning off,
The warm-veined double of Time
And his scarving beard from a book,
Slashed down the last snake as though
It were a wand or subtle bough,
Its tongue peeled in the wrap of a leaf.

Every morning I make,
After a water-face walk,
The death-stagged scatter-breath
Mammoth and sparrowfall
Everybody's earth.
Where birds ride like leaves and boats like ducks
I heard, this morning, waking,
Crossly out of the town noises
A voice in the erected air,
No prophet-progeny of mine,
Cry my sea town was breaking.
I drew the white sheet over the islands
And the coins on my eyelids sang like shells. 

When I'm embraced by airy inspiration,
I am a bridge between the sky and earth.
Of all what heart high-values in creation
I am a king, when breathing with a verse!

Just if my soul wishes it, my fairy,
I shall give you the peaceful coast band,
Where, with a hum, the pinky sea is carrying
The dreaming tide to reach the dreaming land. 

I can do all, just trust in me: I'm mighty;
I have the roots for kindness and for love;
And if I want, from clouds and from the lightning
I'll make a cover your sweet bed above.

And I can, dear, create a word such special,
That it would change laws of the whole world,
To call again its own celebration
And stop the sun from fall in the night cold.

I'm all another in my inspiration,
I am a bridge between the sky and earth.
Of all what heart high-values in creation
I am a king, when breathing with a verse

When Ida puts her armor on
And draws her trusty blade
The turnips in the bin turn pale,
The apples are afraid.
The quiet kitchen city wakes
And consternation feels,
And quick the tocsin pealeth forth
In long potato peels.

When Ida puts her armor on
The pots and pans succumb,
A wooden spoon her drum-stick is,
A mixing pan her drum;
She charges on the kitchen folk
With silver, tin and steel
She beat the eggs, she whips the cream,
The victory is a meal.

When Ida puts her apron on
Her breast-plate is of blue.
(Checked gingham ruffled top and sides)
Her gauntlets gingham, too;
And thus protected from assault
Of batter, stain and flour
She wars with vegetable foes
And conquers in an hour.

When Ida puts her armor on
She is so fair to see
Her battle with the kitchen folk
Is reproduced in me;
So sweet she is, armed cap-a-pie,
So good her kitchen art
I hardly know which loves her best
My palate or my heart. 

When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
Haply I think on thee--and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate;
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
That then I scorn to change my state with kings. 


Time just flows past 
And you never notice 
Till subtle changes come bubbling to the surface; 
When intimacy turns into indifference.

Time just flows past 
And you never notice 
Till your close friends just drift away; 
When intimacy turns into indifference.

Time just flows past 
And you never notice 
Till people who supported you in tough times just disappear; 
When intimacy turns into indifference.

Time just flows past 
And you never notice
Till one’s cross feels too heavy; 
When intimacy turns into indifference. 

You don't always know
how you know.
It comes slowly, the awareness.
With the certainty and final resignation
of a child learning there's no Santa Claus, 
you just know.

The breakfast table, once a venue
for long dreamy stares
and coffee-flavored kisses, 
becomes a silent stage
for reading the news, 
eating breakfast, and
you just know.

The smell of his shirt
when you'd bury your face there, 
the feel of his hands on your body
as if they had a life of their own
all silently slip to a place
wherever memories go
to gather dust, and
you just know.

You miss the nights, 
how his body and yours
breathed and moved as one.
.  maybe it's those nights
and how they were
that give the knowing life, and
you just know.

Like ocean waves upon the sand, 
love recedes
with all the other yesterdays
and you would trade 
all your tomorrows
to have it back, but
you just know. 

There’s nothing you can do to make it write
When it’s all wrong
There’s nothing you can do, to make it write
But be strong

What can you do, 
When they blame you and tell you
They hate you and try to brake you

I’ve made it rain hate and pain
For something that you didn’t do
For something that doesn’t belong to you
For something that you just walked in to

You can’t explain, and take the blame
For someone else, you where the face
Because there love you can’t misplace
Embrace the face

It’s from the past that you helped build
You sit and wait and hope it’s not too late
For something good you gave you soul and heart
And now it’s all torn apart

What do I do what do I say
How can I help it go away
What can I do what can I say
How can I make it all okay

I hope and pray that we’ll find a way
That we can build a better day

I need you to be there
Always at my side
When there’s now where else
That I can hide

I’m tangled in fear
How can it disappear
I’m in over my head
And they blame you instead


When Klopstock England defied,
Uprose William Blake in his pride;
For old Nobodaddy aloft
. . . and belch'd and cough'd;
Then swore a great oath that made Heaven quake,
And call'd aloud to English Blake.
Blake was giving his body ease,
At Lambeth beneath the poplar trees.
From his seat then started he
And turn'd him round three times three.
The moon at that sight blush'd scarlet red,
The stars threw down their cups and fled,
And all the devils that were in hell,

Answered with a ninefold yell.
Klopstock felt the intripled turn,
And all his bowels began to churn,
And his bowels turn'd round three times three,
And lock'd in his soul with a ninefold key; . . .
Then again old Nobodaddy swore
He ne'er had seen such a thing before,
Since Noah was shut in the ark,
Since Eve first chose her hellfire spark,
Since 'twas the fashion to go naked,
Since the old Anything was created . . . 

Is cut close, blades and bones,
And the stench of sewers is everywhere,
Blood-sloshed floors,
And guards count the dead
With the blink of an eyelid, then hurry home
To supper and love, what saves us
From going mad is to carry a vacant stare
And a quiet half-dead dream. 

When, like a running grave, time tracks you down,
Your calm and cuddled is a scythe of hairs,
Love in her gear is slowly through the house,
Up naked stairs, a turtle in a hearse,
Hauled to the dome,

Comes, like a scissors stalking, tailor age,
Deliver me who timid in my tribe,
Of love am barer than Cadaver's trap
Robbed of the foxy tongue, his footed tape
Of the bone inch

Deliver me, my masters, head and heart,
Heart of Cadaver's candle waxes thin,
When blood, spade-handed, and the logic time
Drive children up like bruises to the thumb,
From maid and head,

For, sunday faced, with dusters in my glove,
Chaste and the chaser, man with the cockshut eye,
I, that time's jacket or the coat of ice
May fail to fasten with a virgin o
In the straight grave,

Stride through Cadaver's country in my force,
My pickbrain masters morsing on the stone
Despair of blood faith in the maiden's slime,
Halt among eunuchs, and the nitric stain
On fork and face.

Time is a foolish fancy, time and fool.
No, no, you lover skull, descending hammer
Descends, my masters, on the entered honour.
You hero skull, Cadaver in the hangar
Tells the stick, 'fail.'

Joy is no knocking nation, sir and madam,
The cancer's fashion, or the summer feather
Lit on the cuddled tree, the cross of fever,
Not city tar and subway bored to foster
Man through macadam.

I dump the waxlights in your tower dome.
Joy is the knock of dust, Cadaver's shoot
Of bud of Adam through his boxy shift,
Love's twilit nation and the skull of state,
Sir, is your doom.

Everything ends, the tower ending and,
(Have with the house of wind), the leaning scene,
Ball of the foot depending from the sun,
(Give, summer, over), the cemented skin,
The actions' end.

All, men my madmen, the unwholesome wind
With whistler's cough contages, time on track
Shapes in a cinder death; love for his trick,
Happy Cadaver's hunger as you take
The kissproof world. 


When lilly kisses rose
and lilly I did know
and trees I thought
grew very deep
and lived
within the forest.

And green
the hay is sweet
and brown
dry moss cries
why.

And lillies white
remind the sky
blue cotton
clouds they swirl.

There grew the two.
so dear
most thought.

Short breath
two centered
scents.
 
And how
before
them both
I stood
once near
their hearts
too far.

And when
I know
how
roses grow
and pressed
so hard
was I.

And cups
of milk
I loaned to
them
cinnamon
and spice.

Sugar sweets
they made
from them
and
now to know
both why.

While
lilly bridged
sweet roses
bank as
water rushes
by. 


I'll do whatever it takes

To breathe you in
Even if it's the last breath I take

To fall asleep in your arms
Even if I am never to wake again

To taste your lips on mine
Even if nothing else is to ever pass them

Because your love is what sends me to heaven
And heaven is where I'll forever stay


When love calls for, 
I dream of your shadow
Brushing all over me
In the  sunshine bright 

When love calls for, 
I embrace you in my stories
Where a  sinking ship flaunts
An everlasting pose with us

When love calls for, 
The peacock dances with joy
Rains pour and kisses us
And our lips dare to touch  

When love calls for, 
The moon gleams with its silver beams
As we envelop our souls
Into each other and slowly unfold

When love calls for
. 




Love died and yet 
The bittersweet lived on
And little knew that pride was left
Now that the love was gone.

And so it grew and filled the house
With barbs and thorns and tares, 
Till peace and hope and faith and trust
Withdrew their gentle wares. 

When love is far away, Every day seems longer.
And as I write to you today, Our love grows stronger.

I have but three words for you and they are
I LOVE YOU. 

The first showers of rain when it sprays on the earth
As if the earth eagerly waiting to quench its thirst
It Spread the  aroma of love all around
Which  Knocked my heart and felt as if new love was born.

When the first virgin sun rays touched the earth and 
Spread the warmth of love 
The earth waiting to feel the warmth of touch
Felt as if the warmth touched my heart speaking of love.

The colourful butterflies were so naughty
asked me teasingly
Whats going on in your heart
That you are blushing with love.

The beautiful fragrance of flowers
Spreading their fragrance all around 
Made me feel that as if essence of love is
Covering me all around.

The mischievous waves came running towards me
And splashed the waters and showering me with love
I don't know when I missed my steps and fell into the love
And it hugged  me so tightly and took me deep into its heart.

Love always comes in disguise
And it grip you so tightly that one cannot escape.



I'm not ashamed of my mental illness
being born
with the genetic triggers.
If a reasonably normal childhood
could have prevailed.

What makes it dangerous is knowing
some thing is wrong
and believing the world is not sane.

What's even worse is watching cops on t. 

v.
whom expect a normal out come
from some one they know that's not there. 

When Memory, with gentle hand,
Has led me to that foreign land
Of childhood days, I long to be
Again the boy on bended knee,
With head a-bow, and drowsy smile
Hid in a mother's lap the while,
With tender touch and kindly care,
She bends above and combs my hair.

Ere threats of Time, or ghosts of cares
Had paled it to the hue it wears,
Its tangled threads of amber light
Fell o'er a forehead, fair and white,
That only knew the light caress
Of loving hands, or sudden press
Of kisses that were sifted there
The times when mother combed my hair.

But its last gleams of gold have slipped
Away; and Sorrow's manuscript
Is fashioned of the snowy brow--
So lined and underscored now
That you, to see it, scarce would guess
It e'er had felt the fond caress
Of loving lips, or known the care
Of those dear hands that combed my hair.

. . . . . . . .

I am so tired! Let me be
A moment at my mother's knee;
One moment--that I may forget
The trials waiting for me yet:
One moment free from every pain--
O! Mother! Comb my hair again!
And I will, oh, so humbly bow,
For I've a wife that combs it now.


I.

When my dreams come true--when my dreams come true--
Shall I lean from out my casement, in the starlight and the dew,
To listen--smile and listen to the tinkle of the strings
Of the sweet guitar my lover's fingers fondle, as he sings?
And as the nude moon slowly, slowly shoulders into view,
Shall I vanish from his vision--when my dreams come true?

When my dreams come true--shall the simple gown I wear
Be changed to softest satin, and my maiden-braided hair
Be raveled into flossy mists of rarest, fairest gold,
To be minted into kisses, more than any heart can hold?--
Or 'the summer of my tresses' shall my lover liken to
'The fervor of his passion'--when my dreams come true?

II.

When my dreams come true--I shall bide among the sheaves
Of happy harvest meadows; and the grasses and the leaves
Shall lift and lean between me and the splendor of the sun,
Till the noon swoons into twilight, and the gleaners' work is done--
Save that yet an arm shall bind me, even as the reapers do
The meanest sheaf of harvest--when my dreams come true.

When my dreams come true! when my dreams come true!
True love in all simplicity is fresh and pure as dew;--
The blossom in the blackest mold is kindlier to the eye
Than any lily born of pride that looms against the sky:
And so it is I know my heart will gladly welcome you,
My lowliest of lovers, when my dreams come true. 


When my eyes first glimpsed upon you
They touched your sweet lips
A dulcet kiss of happiness.

Then they progressed to the embrace of your arms
The yearn of your warmth
Was captured by my heart.

They flowed with the river from your head
The stream of elegance they saw
‘Pon your beauty my eyes tread.

Your smile shone my eyes till blind
Enthralled by your blessedness
All day and night - it's you I try to find.

My eyes then grab yours hand
And dance together with friendship
A moon by stars is where they stand.

Oh! That sparkle is my escapade
Our journey is my endeavour
When my eyes jazz with yours
They will dance forever. 

When my mind was cleansed of impurities, 
like a mirror of its dust and dirt,
I recognized the Self in me:
When I saw Him dwelling in me,
I realized that He was the 

Everything and I was nothing. 

I have your heart within me

that keeps telling me love story every night


to purify our hearts and soul with affections

When your heart and my soul touch each other

then there is no room for sadness

When my eyes close for sleep 

then my soul awakes and kisses your heart 

When your heart plays music with my soul

then the melodies hover like nightingales

When your heart is longing for my love

then my soul is belonging to beautiful nights

When my soul loves your heart

then its not only what your heart for

but for what my soul lives with you heart


 

While the three little words 'Happy New Year'
Again, like music, capture our ears, 
May bonny, bouncing, bright-eyed cheer
Ring door-bells all and call 'I'm here! '

May all your friends and relatives dear -
Be they far or be they near -
Be robbed by Old Year of all your fears
And, by New Year, be cheated of tears! 

Away from hurdles may you veer
And successwards your journey steer.
With perseverance may you spear
Ahead, throughout your life's carreer.

May Health's rosy face appear
And Wealth's footsteps may you hear.
May Hope, the way for Happiness, clear.
May Good Fortune bring up the rear. 


I.

When old Jack died, we staid from school (they said,
At home, we needn't go that day), and none
Of us ate any breakfast--only one,
And that was Papa--and his eyes were red
When he came round where we were, by the shed
Where Jack was lying, half way in the sun
And half way in the shade. When we begun
To cry out loud, Pa turned and dropped his head
And went away; and Mamma, she went back
Into the kitchen. Then, for a long while,
All to ourselves, like, we stood there and cried.
We thought so many good things of Old Jack,
And funny things--although we didn't smile--We
couldn't only cry when Old Jack died.

II.

When Old Jack died, it seemed a human friend
Had suddenly gone from us; that some face
That we had loved to fondle and embrace
From babyhood, no more would condescend
To smile on us forever. We might bend
With tearful eyes above him, interlace
Our chubby fingers o'er him, romp and race,
Plead with him, call and coax--aye, we might send
The old halloo up for him, whistle, hist,
(If sobs had let us) or, as wildly vain,
Snapped thumbs, called 'speak,' and he had not replied;
We might have gone down on our knees and kissed
The tousled ears, and yet they must remain
Deaf, motionless, we knew--when Old Jack died.

III.

When Old Jack died, it seemed to us, some way,
That all the other dogs in town were pained
With our bereavement, and some that were chained,
Even, unslipped their collars on that day
To visit Jack in state, as though to pay
A last, sad tribute there, while neighbors craned
Their heads above the high board fence, and deigned
To sigh 'Poor dog!' remembering how they
Had cuffed him, when alive, perchance, because,
For love of them he leaped to lick their hands--
Now, that he could not, were they satisfied?
We children thought that, as we crossed his paws,
And o'er his grave, 'way down the bottom-lands,
Wrote 'Our First Love Lies Here,' when Old Jack died. 


When once the twilight locks no longer
Locked in the long worm of my finger
Nor damned the sea that sped about my fist,
The mouth of time sucked, like a sponge,
The milky acid on each hinge,
And swallowed dry the waters of the breast.

When the galactic sea was sucked
And all the dry seabed unlocked,
I sent my creature scouting on the globe,
That globe itself of hair and bone
That, sewn to me by nerve and brain,
Had stringed my flask of matter to his rib.

My fuses are timed to charge his heart,
He blew like powder to the light
And held a little sabbath with the sun,
But when the stars, assuming shape,
Drew in his eyes the straws of sleep
He drowned his father's magics in a dream.

All issue armoured, of the grave,
The redhaired cancer still alive,
The cataracted eyes that filmed their cloth;
Some dead undid their bushy jaws,
And bags of blood let out their flies;

Sleep navigates the tides of time;
The dry Sargasso of the tomb
Gives up its dead to such a working sea;
And sleep rolls mute above the beds
Where fishes' food is fed the shades
Who periscope through flowers to the sky.

When once the twilight screws were turned,
And mother milk was stiff as sand,
I sent my own ambassador to light;
By trick or chance he fell asleep
And conjured up a carcass shape
To rob me of my fluids in his heart.

Awake, my sleeper, to the sun,
A worker in the morning town,
And leave the poppied pickthank where he lies;
The fences of the light are down,
All but the briskest riders thrown
And worlds hang on the trees. 


When rivers run cold, it makes you wonder if they were ever warm
Why we ever went skinny-dipping, swam naked in a thunderstorm
When fires turn to ashes, it makes you wonder did they ever burn.
Why was the air sulphur every other silent nocturne? 

When gentle words turn harsh, it makes you wonder what went wrong
Why we ever stayed, what happened to all that loving birdsong
When love turns to hate it makes you wonder why we ever kissed
Why we ever [melted] only to freeze up like snow inside too cold to exist.

When your soul is left wondering where to go because you're all alone
Is it time to rewrite another chapter, cross over that next stepping-stone? 
When your heart is like a wilting tulip is it time to close up and drop
Or is it time to rise anew and flower atop of all those others nonstop.

The healings in your heart and soul, don't let them rivers run cold or dry
There are fires eternal simple as a simple firefly no one else can see or classify
When words turn ugly hold out an olive branch and remember it isn't you
It isn't you, it isn't you, and remembers you can't be ever, subdued.

When rivers run cold, it makes you wonder if they were ever warm
Why we ever went skinny-dipping, swam naked in a thunderstorm
When fires turn to ashes, it makes you wonder did they ever burn.
Why was the air sulphur every other silent nocturne? 


Just remember it isn't you. It wasn't you, you built a fire 
You were sent here to be a beautifier. 


When she comes home again! A thousand ways
I fashion, to myself, the tenderness
Of my glad welcome: I shall tremble--yes;
And touch her, as when first in the old days
I touched her girlish hand, nor dared upraise
Mine eyes, such was my faint heart's sweet distress.
Then silence: And the perfume of her dress:
The room will sway a little, and a haze
Cloy eyesight--soulsight, even--for a space:
And tears--yes; and the ache here in the throat,
To know that I so ill deserve the place
Her arms make for me; and the sobbing note
I stay with kisses, ere the tearful face
Again is hidden in the old embrace. 

No one knows my lady when she's lonely
No one sees the fantasies and fears my lady hides
There are those who've shared her love and laughter
But no one hears my lady when she cries-but me
No one hears my lady when she cries 
And when she cries she makes you wanna run
And chase the sun and bring it back
To brighten up a corner of her dark and troubled skies
When she cries 
She walks barefoot through the misty mornin'
Dreams of golden yesterdays reflectin' in her eyes
But soon the evenin' shadows crowd around her
Frightening my lady till she cries-for me
Frightening my lady, till she cries 
You may have seen her lyin' in your lamplight
And if you've heard her whispered words, it comes as no surprise
So be the one she shares her secret smiles with
But send me back my lady when she cries-for me
My lady's gonna need me when she cries


A graveyard speaks
In silence
Of the souls
That rests in peace.

Monuments speaks in silence of
The untold Mysteries.

A library speaks
In silence
Of the books
That nourishes knowledge.

The stories speaks
In silence
Of the words Untold.

Jokes speaks in
Silence of the Pain
In humorous way.

Love speaks in Silence
Of the unspoken desire.

Weeping in silence speaks
Of wound that
Cut deep down the heart.

Poems speak in silence
Of the strong words
That bring pain or joy.

Eyes speaks in silence
Of love or hatred, 
Mixture of emotions.

Words speaks in silence
Of the thoughts that it went thru.
Thoughts speaks in silence
Of the surroundings that it went thru
Actions speaks in silence
Of the pain or love it went thru
Revenge speaks in silence
Of the hatred that it went thru.

If Injustice is silenced. 
Appreciate the Silence of deaf and dumb.

Mind speak in silence
Of the calmness
That it longed for.

Silence is golden
As long as one is not victimized  by Silence! 



Have you heard the
Voice of silence
So powerful it is
That no louder you shout
On top of your voice
All may fall deaf to your ears
But the silence can be heard too
In a very powerful way
So is the silence a powerful tool too
To speak out directly into your heart.

When a silence toast with drinks of love
So wonderful would it be.
That one may fly in the heaven's world.
Along with the toast of love.
Love is the only drink
Which make us cheerful
But hatred, jealously is the drinks like  poison
When toasted in silence kills one.

Loud of cheers to be heard of Outside
Everything cooler
Cheers the winner
But inside is the
Drinks of bitterness, 
Pain or failures of drinks
Toasted  with silence
especially when near ones
Are not happy about the winner.

Forget it..
Life will move on
No one cares what
You  drink.
A day will come
When one climb the ladder of success
Silence will toast the drink of success.
Though not heard louder.
 But Heart will hear in Silence.

Yes the sometime Silence  may cheer our drinks..




you left your window open
you wanted the moon to light up the darkness
when nothing was there to light you up

you were in between
moonlight and the midnight

when the world is sleeping
your eyes wanted to see the other sides of pain
you laughed made fun of the joke
and you smiled when you saw the moon smiling by

it’s time for you to sleep now
people saw all the paintings 
people saw all the colours 
that you created the whole night in the darkness

darkness and nights

everything is beautiful now


I read the lines you wrote
‘I am doing nothing, not even sleeping
But I am not useless, 
Uselessness is early death.  
In solitude’.

you felt lonely and sleepy too
and sleep with the moon just by your side
everything smiled back at you
and I kissed you through these pure lights

it’s all a pious relationship of 
all beautiful causes 
and
all beautiful effects
in right time inside the space
in right space inside the time

peaceful is the sleep 
when you feel through your all senses
that everything you are surrounded by
loves you


When stretch'd on one's bed 
With a fierce-throbbing head, 
Which preculdes alike thought or repose, 
How little one cares 
For the grandest affairs 
That may busy the world as it goes!

How little one feels 
For the waltzes and reels 
Of our Dance-loving friends at a Ball! 
How slight one's concern 
To conjecture or learn 
What their flounces or hearts may befall.

How little one minds 
If a company dines 
On the best that the Season affords! 
How short is one's muse 
O'er the Sauces and Stews, 

How little the Bells, 
Ring they Peels, toll they Knells, 
Can attract our attention or Ears! 
The Bride may be married, 
The Corse may be carried 
And touch nor our hopes nor our fears.

Our own bodily pains 
Ev'ry faculty chains; 
We can feel on no subject besides. 
Tis in health and in ease 
We the power must seize 
For our friends and our souls to provide. 

When Susanna Jones wears red
her face is like an ancient cameo
Turned brown by the ages.

When Susanna Jones wears red
Walks once again.

And the beauty of Susanna Jones in red
Burns in my heart a love-fire sharp like a pain.

Overdosed with fatality and fear
Stung by the scorpion of betrayal
Raped by life's ravaging realities
Terminally tormented by my past
Reduced to nothing- ground zero disease
Death looks like the sun-life's a starless night
Despair dilutes desire for living


Stripped naked of everything except being
Wiped, weary, worn-damaged but not destroyed
Drowning in my own tears but still swimming
Lying in my own blood but still breathing
Discouraged and depressed-down but now out
Hanging by a thread but I won't let go
Death's calling my name but I choose to live


When that I was and a little tiny boy,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish thing was but a toy,
For the rain it raineth every day.

But when I came to man's estate,
With hey, ho, . . .
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
For the rain, . . .

But when I came, alas! to wive,
With hey, ho, . . .
By swaggering could I never thrive,
For the rain, . . .

But when I came unto my beds,
With hey, ho, . . .
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
For the rain, . . .

A great while ago the world begun,
With hey, ho, . . .
But that's all one, our play is done.
And we'll strive to please you every day. 


When the kindly hours of darkness, save for light of moon and star, 
Hide the picture on the signboard over Doughty's Horse Bazaar; 
When the last rose-tint is fading on the distant mulga scrub, 
Then the Army prays for Watty at the entrance of his pub. 
 
Now, I often sit at Watty's when the night is very near, 
With a head that's full of jingles and the fumes of bottled beer, 
For I always have a fancy that, if I am over there 
When the Army prays for Watty, I'm included in the prayer. 
 
Watty lounges in his arm-chair, in its old accustomed place, 
With a fatherly expression on his round and passive face; 
And his arms are clasped before him in a calm, contented way, 
And he nods his head and dozes when he hears the Army pray. 
 
And I wonder does he ponder on the distant years and dim, 
Or his chances over yonder, when the Army prays for him? 
Has he not a fear connected with the warm place down below, 
 
But his features give no token of a feeling in his breast, 
Save of peace that is unbroken and a conscience well at rest; 
And we guzzle as we guzzled long before the Army came, 
And the loafers wait for `shouters' and -- they get there just the same. 
 
It would take a lot of praying -- lots of thumping on the drum -- 
To prepare our sinful, straying, erring souls for Kingdom Come; 
But I love my fellow-sinners, and I hope, upon the whole, 
That the Army gets a hearing when it prays for Watty's soul. 

Oh, the scene is wide an’ dreary an’ the sun is settin’ red,
An’ the grey-black sky of winter’s comin’ closer overhead.
Oh, the sun is settin’ bloody with a blood-line on the snow,
An’ across it to the westward you can see old Bruin go;
You can see old Shaggy go,
You can see the brown Bear go,
An’ he’s draggin’ one leg arter, an’ he’s travellin’ pretty slow. 
We can send a long shot arter, but he doesn’t seem to know—
There’s a thin red line behind him where it’s dripped across the snow;
He is weary an’ he’s wounded, with his own blood he’s half-blind,
He is licked an’ he’s defeated, an’ he’s left some cubs behind;
Yes, he’s left some cubs behind;
Oh, he’s left some cubs behind;
To the tune of sixty thousand he has left some cubs behind. 

Oh, they’ve pulled him by the nose-ring and they’ve baited him in pits,
An’ they bluffed him, an’ they bruised him, an’ they mostly gave him fits;
But he hugged ’em badly one time when they tried him in his den—
An’ he’ll make it warm for someone when he comes back East again;
When the Bear comes back again,
When he’s lopin’ round again,
There’ll be lively times for Jacko when the Bear comes back again. 

Oh, we chased him out of Turkey—I don’t know for what idea,
It took two dogs an’ a lion for to beat him in Crimea;
He’s goin’ home to lick his wounds, he’s goin’ to his den,
But he’ll make it warm for someone when he comes South-East again,
When the Bear comes back again,
When old Bruin comes again,
He will make some dead to die on when he comes back from his den. 

Keep a sharp look-out behind you, every way you turn, my lad,
It don’t matter who you might be, for you bet the Bear is mad;
Keep a sharp look-out to Nor’ard, to the South an’ West an’ East,
For he mostly always finds you where you most expect him least;
Where you most expect him leastest,
Where you most expect him least,
Oh, you’ll catch him grabbin’ for yer where you most expect him least. 


There's a happy time coming, 
When the boys come home. 
There's a glorious day coming, 
When the boys come home. 
We will end the dreadful story 
Of this treason dark and gory 
In a sunburst of glory, 
When the boys come home. 

The day will seem brighter 
When the boys come home, 
For our hearts will be lighter 
When the boys come home. 
Wives and sweethearts will press them 
In their arms and caress them, 
When the boys come home. 

The thinned ranks will be proudest 
When the boys come home, 
And their cheer will ring the loudest 
When the boys come home. 
The full ranks will be shattered, 
And the bright arms will be battered, 
And the battle-standards tattered, 
When the boys come home. 

Their bayonets may be rusty, 
When the boys come home, 
And their uniforms dusty, 
When the boys come home. 
But all shall see the traces 
Of battle's royal graces, 
In the brown and bearded faces, 
When the boys come home. 

Our love shall go to meet them, 
When the boys come home, 
To bless them and to greet them, 
When the boys come home; 
And the fame of their endeavor 
Time and change shall not dissever 
From the nation's heart forever, 
When the boys come home. 

When the clock strikes twelve
new year is born
with gaiety’s morn, 
new chapter is opened
old book is shorn

Our future is carried
into another new year, 
with hopes, 
that this new year  
will bring in cheer, 
will bring in no fear
slough off tortures
no more massacres
and
no more tears..



with your power and strength divine, 
inundate our hearts, with truth and light, 
props us with your immeasurable might, 
make us not breakers, or crashers on the shore, 
but like torches to flame and brighten us more


Make us like beacons
like the stars and the moon, 
who selflessly burn
so that others may turn
their lives into bright lanturns, 
not in Cimmerian darkness
and sleep in the arms of Morpheus.


Forgive our enemies, 
and  make them see, 
a peace that is lasting.
Let this siloloquy
not be an ephemeral, 
but everlasting joy
for all to see
throughout  Cure our hatred, 
break our hauteur
end our factions, 
and bend our pride, 
to your control

Guerdon us with opulent joys
Of health, wealth and happiness, 
this is my cry.





When the cows come home the milk is coming, 
Honey's made while the bees are humming; 
Duck and drake on the rushy lake, 
And the deer live safe in the breezy brake; 
And timid, funny, brisk little bunny, 
Winks his nose and sits all sunny. 


When the dark comes down, oh, the wind is on the sea
With lisping laugh and whimper to the red reef's threnody,
The boats are sailing homeward now across the harbor bar
With many a jest and many a shout from fishing grounds afar.
So furl your sails and take your rest, ye fisher folk so brown,
For task and quest are ended when the dark comes down. 

When the dark comes down, oh, the landward valleys fill
Like brimming cups of purple, and on every landward hill
There shines a star of twilight that is watching evermore
The low, dim lighted meadows by the long, dim-lighted shore,
For there, where vagrant daisies weave the grass a silver crown,
The lads and lassies wander when the dark comes down. 

When the dark comes down, oh, the children fall asleep,
And mothers in the fisher huts their happy vigils keep;
There's music in the song they sing and music on the sea, 
The loving, lingering echoes of the twilight's litany,
For toil has folded hands to dream, and care has ceased to frown,
And every wave's a lyric when the dark comes down. 


You stand like a rock
or a tall oak tree
just behind me
To catch me if I fall
or need someone to lean on
when the darkness calls

You have been my help 
in times of need
A wonderful feeling
it will always be
When darkness calls
you stand by me

Your roots run deep
and on your strength I rely
You quiet me so I can sleep
Harbored within these walls
the need of someone
when the darkness calls


when the dawn of mankind
arrived 

we were not alive, but
we were waiting

in a queue, not as beings
but nevertheless there

our arrival was heralded 
by crying

'we are here, we are here'
nothing more

the dawning of our new lives
came to be


When the Day came -
The Day I had lived and died for -
The Day that is not in any calendar -
Clouds heavy with love
Showered me with wild abundance.
Inside me, my soul was drenched.
Around me, even the desert grew green. 


When the lucent skies of morning flush with dawning rose once more,
And waves of golden glory break adown the sunrise shore,
And o'er the arch of heaven pied films of vapor float.
There's joyance and there's freedom when the fishing boats go out. 

The wind is blowing freshly up from far, uncharted caves,
And sending sparkling kisses o'er the brows of virgin waves,
While routed dawn-mists shiver­oh, far and fast they flee,
Pierced by the shafts of sunrise athwart the merry sea! 

Behind us, fair, light-smitten hills in dappled splendor lie,
Before us the wide ocean runs to meet the limpid sky­
Our hearts are full of poignant life, and care has fled afar
As sweeps the white-winged fishing fleet across the harbor bar. 




The sea is calling to us in a blithesome voice and free,
There's keenest rapture on its breast and boundless liberty!
Each man is master of his craft, its gleaming sails out-blown,
And far behind him on the shore a home he calls his own. 

Salt is the breath of ocean slopes and fresher blows the breeze,
And swifter still each bounding keel cuts through the combing seas,
Athwart our masts the shadows of the dipping sea-gulls float,
And all the water-world's alive when the fishing boats go out. 


When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock
And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the struttin' turkey cock
And the clackin' of the guineys, and the cluckin' of the hens
And the rooster's hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the fence
O, it's then's the times a feller is a-feelin' at his best
With the risin' sun to greet him from a night of peaceful rest
As he leaves the house, bareheaded, and goes out to feed the stock
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock 

They's something kindo' harty-like about the atmusfere 
When the heat of summer's over and the coolin' fall is here 
Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossums on the trees
And the mumble of the hummin'-birds and buzzin' of the bees
But the air's so appetizin'; and the landscape through the haze 
Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn days 
Is a pictur' that no painter has the colorin' to mock 
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock. 

The husky, rusty russel of the tossels of the corn, 
And the raspin' of the tangled leaves, as golden as the morn; 
The stubble in the furries kindo' lonesome-like, but still 
A-preachin' sermuns to us of the barns they growed to fill; 
The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in the shed; 
The hosses in theyr stalls below the clover over-head! 
O, it sets my hart a-clickin' like the tickin' of a clock, 
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock! 

Then your apples all is gethered, and the ones a feller keeps 
Is poured around the celler-floor in red and yeller heaps; 
And your cider-makin' 's over, and your wimmern-folks is through 
With their mince and apple butter, and theyr souse and saussage, too!
I don't know how to tell it but ef sich a thing could be 
As the Angels wantin' boardin', and they'd call around on me 
I'd want to 'commodate 'em all the whole-indurin' flock
When the frost is on the punkin and the fodder's in the shock


In spring, when the green gits back in the trees,
And the sun comes out and stays,
And yer boots pulls on with a good tight squeeze,
And you think of yer barefoot days;
When you ort to work and you want to not,
And you and yer wife agrees
It's time to spade up the garden lot,
When the green gits back in the trees--
Well! work is the least o' _my_ idees
When the green, you know, gits back in the trees!

When the green gits back in the trees, and bees
Is a-buzzin' aroun' agin,
In that kind of a lazy go-as-you-please
Old gait they bum roun' in;
When the groun's all bald where the hay-rick stood,
And the crick 's riz, and the breeze
Coaxes the bloom in the old dogwood,
And the green gits back in the trees,--
I like, as I say, in sich scenes as these,
The time when the green gits back in the trees!

When the whole tail-feathers o' wintertime
Is all pulled out and gone!
And the sap it thaws and begins to climb,
And the sweat it starts out on
A feller's forred, a-gittin' down
At the old spring on his knees--
I kind o' like jes' a-loaferin' roun'
When the green gits back in the trees--
Jes' a-potterin' roun' as I--durn--please--
When the green, you know, gits back in the trees


A thing 'at's 'bout as tryin' as a healthy man kin meet
Is some poor feller's funeral a-joggin' 'long the street:
The slow hearse and the hosses-- slow enough, to say at least,
Fer to even tax the patience of gentleman deceased!
The low scrunch of the gravel-- and the slow grind of the wheels--,
The slow, slow go of ev'ry woe 'at ev'rybody feels!
So I ruther like the contrast when I hear the whip-lash crack
A quickstep fer the hosses,
When the
Hearse
Comes
Back!

Meet it goin' to'rds the cimet'ry, you'll want to drap yer eyes--
But ef the plumes don't fetch you, it'll ketch you otherwise--
You'll haf to see the caskit, though you'd ort to look away
And 'conomize and save yer sighs fer any other day!
Yer sympathizin' won't wake up the sleeper from his rest--
Yer tears won't thaw them hands o' his 'at's froze acrost his breast!
And this is why-- when airth and sky's a gittin blurred and black--
I like the flash and hurry
When the
Hearse
Comes
Back!

It's not 'cause I don't 'preciate it ain't no time fer jokes,
Ner 'cause I' got no common human feelin' fer the folks--;
Fer my hearth's 'bout as mal'able as any other chap's--,
I've buried father, mother-- But I'll haf to jes' git you
To 'excuse me,' as the feller says--. The p'int I'm drivin' to
Is simply when we're plum broke down and all knocked out o' whack,
It he'ps to shape us up like,
When the
Hearse
Comes
Back!

The idy! Wadin round here over shoe-mouth deep in woe,
When they's a graded 'pike o' joy and sunshine don't you know!
When evening strikes the pastur', cows'll pull out fer the bars,
And skittish-like from out the night'll prance the happy stars.
And so when my time comes to die, and I've got ary friend
'At wants expressed my last request-- I'll mebby, rickommend
To drive slow, ef they haf to, goin' 'long the out'ard track,
But I'll smile and say, 'You speed 'em


When the
Hearse
Comes
Back!


'When the night welcomes you and me
And another day is called for romantic evening
Our love is shared with each other thoughts
and always brings us as a special occasion

When the moonlight splashes in the dark
while those stars spark like diamonds
When the wind touches us with softy tune
while the nights music just remain as right

I take you in my arms and hold you with hopes
Together sharing our dreams to come true
Your kisses are long and deep with heart
and makes me to understand, you are mine forever


When the rain drops fall on my head
Then I feel the greatness of the nature
When the heat on earth vaporized
Then the clouds above makes the rain

When the rain drops fall on my head
Then I see the farmers are full of cheers
When the rain water roll on the ground
Then all the barren lands turns to green

When the rain drops fall on my head
Then I see the rain water runs down the mountains
When the rain water preserved in the built dam
Then there is no poverty on the land 

When the rain drops fall on my head
When we do not go against the nature
Then the rain drops fall on the earth for ever


WHEN the sun comes after rain
And the bird is in the blue,
The girls go down the lane
Two by two.

When the sun comes after shadow
And the singing of the showers,
The girls go up the meadow,
Fair as flowers.

When the eve comes dusky red
And the moon succeeds the sun,
The girls go home to bed
One by one.

And when life draws to its even
And the day of man is past,
They shall all go home to heaven,
Home at last. 


WHEN the two sisters go to fetch water, they come to this spot and they smile.
They must be aware of somebody who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water.

The two sisters whisper to each other when they pass this spot.
They must have guessed the secret of that somebody who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water.

Their pitchers lurch suddenly, and water spills when they reach this spot.
They must have found out that somebody's heart is beating who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water.

The two sisters glance at each other when they come to this spot, and they smile.
There is a laughter in their swift-stepping feet, which makes confusion in somebody's mind who stands behind the trees whenever they go to fetch water. 


When the wind storms by with a shout, and the stern sea-caves
Rejoice in the tramp and the roar of onsetting waves,
Then, then, it comes home to the heart that the top of life
Is the passion that burns the blood in the act of strife -
Till you pity the dead down there in their quiet graves.

But to drowse with the fen behind and the fog before,
When the rain-rot spreads and a tame sea mumbles the shore,
Not to adventure, none to fight, no right and no wrong,
Sons of the Sword heart-sick for a stave of your sire's old song -
O, you envy the blessed death that can live no more


When the winter chrysanthemums go,
there's nothing to write about
    but radishes.




I cannot but remember 
   When the year grows old -- 
October -- November -- 
   How she disliked the cold! 

She used to watch the swallows 
   Go down across the sky, 
And turn from the window 
   With a little sharp sigh. 

And often when the brown leaves 
   Were brittle on the ground, 
And the wind in the chimney 
   Made a melancholy sound, 

She had a look about her 
   That I wish I could forget -- 
The look of a scared thing 
   Sitting in a net! 

Oh, beautiful at nightfall 
   The soft spitting snow! 
And beautiful the bare boughs 
   Rubbing to and fro! 

But the roaring of the fire, 
   And the warmth of fur, 
And the boiling of the kettle 
   Were beautiful to her! 

I cannot but remember 
   When the year grows old -- 
October -- November -- 
   How she disliked the cold


When this Cloth gets too old
I shall take this Flight
Into the Arms of JAH, and
He will forget the Sin
Of the Flesh I am in
Only He shall recall the Good
Of the Soul that is His-
When this Cloth gets too old
And I take this Flight-Speak and be silent
There is a time for sure to
listen humbly first


When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
And moan the expense of many a vanished sight:
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before.
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
All losses are restored and sorrows end. 


When two consciousnesses 
meet merge and melt
into each other 
It is ecstasy.

It is deep.
It is significant
and beautiful.

It is divine and human
at the same moment.

Then sexual act declines
and fall into a lower level.




when your hero falls from grace
all fairy tales r uncovered
myths exposed and pain magnified
the greatest pain discovered
u taught me be strong
but im confused c u so weak
u said never give up
and it hurts c u welcome defeat
when ure hero falls so do the stars
and so does the perception of tomorrow
without my hero there is only
me alone deal with my sorrow
your heart ceases work
and your soul is not happy at all
what r u expected do
when ure only hero falls


When we are old and these rejoicing veins
Are frosty channels to a muted stream,
And out of all our burning their remains
No feeblest spark to fire us, even in dream,
This be our solace: that it was not said
When we were young and warm and in our prime,
Upon our couch we lay as lie the dead,
Sleeping away the unreturning time.
O sweet, O heavy-lidded, O my love,
When morning strikes her spear upon the land,
And we must rise and arm us and reprove
The insolent daylight with a steady hand,
Be not discountenanced if the knowing know
We rose from rapture but an hour ago. 


Krakatoa roars lava flows
Natives scattered to death
Grasses no longer need a mow
Leaving no lives and wealth

I’d float like a feather
Falls into your abyss of devotion, 
Drowns in your pond of murmur
Plunging in slow motion

Like Krakatoa, you expel your lethal blow
Shattering me into million pieces
But I'd stand right to the core
Of your devil’s glimpses

Your snowy little heart
As cool as your talk
No matter how no matter what
I’d come to you and do the walk

Please don’t leave me
If I ever hurt you
Shall I beg for mercy? 
As my love isn’t true


One day when you find me stranded
Heading to the road of insanity
Straying to nowhere and unwanted
That’s the day love has gone awry

My heart turns blue unlike the roses
Bright red as our once passion
Why the halts and pauses
No more intense and seduction

Our love poem is reminder
Catastrophe of human tragedy
My blood bleeds like water
A sign of your cruelty


Marriage no longer exists
Those were the dreams
Your sweet sticky kiss
As good as it seems

When I go down to the soil
I’d carry your heart with me
Treasure our romance and brawl
From then to eternity


Oh, what a tangled web we weave, 
When we first deceive. 
Oh, I never really knew what these words 
Meant, 
Until I met you last night. 
You were beautiful, 
You were lovely, 
You looked so great in the moonlight. 
I felt faint, 
I lost my head, 
I just couldn't wait. 


I headed straight for you, 
I want to be in your arms, 
Oh, how you deceive, 
Things aren't always what they appear to be, 
You weren't such a slick siren, 
There for my fancy, 
You were waiting for your dinner 
partner, 
Your invite was intoxicating, 
Your looks were great, 
Your arms were out stretched, 
And just couldn't wait. 

Just about then I finally realized, 
I couldn't come to you, 
You were out of my class, 
You were so beautiful, 
This was without doubt. 
However, if I came I would end up in your spider's mouth. 


When we go, do we all have to play harps? If we do, 
I'm assuming we'll instantly know how to play them, 
right? It's not like we'll have to take lessons or anything, 
right? 


Reason I'm asking is that, well, do you think I might 
ask (politely)  if I could forego the harp and instead have 
a Hammond Borgan along with the instant ability to 
play it? That would be so cool, especially through 
Leslie speakers! In real life, the Bis soooo heavy, but 
I figure in heaven I won't have to worry about that, 
either because everything will be very light or because 
there will be roadies to move things for me. Am I being 
presumptuous? I mean, maybe everyone in heaven will 
be too lazy to want to move equipment around. 

So I was thinking - tell me if this is too farfetched - 
maybe we could get some people from hell to do it, you 
know, like on a weekend pass from their boiling 
cauldrons. Just the ones that deserve a break, you know. 
Not murderers or anything, maybe just a couple of 
shoplifters or something. They'd probably think hauling 
around musical equipment would be like a paid 
vacation after being impaled on pitchforks or bull-
whipped or whatever. I don't know, just a thought. 
What do you think?>When we were younger 
we would gaze at each other 
I always wounder what you were thinking, 
I always Wounded why your brown eyes would
be gaze on me. 

When i was younger i didn't know a thing! 
When you first said you liked me my heart felt 
angels above singing! 
When you said you loved me i thought i 
was dreaming. 


The first time we talk a million angle's stop my heart
since we were apart my Heart ache and brunt
Now i know why. 

Ive never had someone to care for me
And Ive never told anyone how i feel when am with you 
My feelings and thoughts were different, i thought 
i would lose this blessed thing but i took a risk and
here we are. 

Its nearly been a year and for sure i 
can tell you all that my heart has been loyal 
He's My World and Boy does it rock! 
He's My Light and gosh He Can shine. 

I never wanna say good bye Not Now Not Ever!  


When we two parted 
 In silence and tears, 
Half broken-hearted 
 To sever for years, 
Pale grew thy cheek and cold, 
 Colder thy kiss; 
Truly that hour foretold 
 Sorrow to this. 

The dew of the morning 
 Sunk chill on my brow-- 
It felt like the warning 
 Of what I feel now. 
Thy vows are all broken, 
 And light is thy fame; 
I hear thy name spoken, 
 And share in its shame. 

They name thee before me, 
 A knell to mine ear; 
A shrudder comes o'er me-- 
 Why wert thou so dear? 
They know not I knew thee, 
 Who knew thee so well-- 
Long, long I shall rue thee, 
 Too deeply to tell. 

In secret we met-- 
 In silence I grieve, 
That thy heart could forget, 
 Thy spirit deceive 
If I should meet thee 
 After long years, 
How should I greet thee?-- 
 With silence and tears.


I remember when we was young, we played football at the park
You, your friends and I would play for hours until it got dark

I remember when we was young, we always played on the nintendo
Sometimes arguments would start, our favourite game was mario

I remember when we was young, we'd set booby traps like home alone
We'd put tiny cars on the floor and call it the danger zone

I remember when we was young, we went to grandma's for a week
One morning we fought and spilt my cereal, after that we didn't speak

I remember when we was young, I'd sit and watch you on the 
You pretended you didn't want me there but I knew sometimes I helped you

I remember when we was young, we went on holiday to Auntie Suzies
We played in the pool all morning then bathed in her cool Jaccuzi

We still got a lot of presents and Mum drew us those pictures

I remember when we was young, things were pretty dangerous
Although we did have fun, things were more than hard for us

I remember when we was young, we had a secret life that nobody knew
Dad would give us a fright and beat Mum black and blue

I remember when we was young, we would talk heart to heart
Things have changed dramatically, I didn't expect us to part

I remember when we was young, we had a special kind of bond
Now that we are older, that seems to have dissapeared and gonewhen we were here together 
in a place we did not know, nor one
another.
A bit of grass held between the teeth for a moment, bright hair on the 
wind.
What we were we did not know, nor even the grass or the flame of 
hair turning to ash on the wind.
But they lied about that. From the beginning they lied. To the child, 
telling him that there was somewhere anger against him, and a 
hatred against him, and the only reason for his being in the 
world.
But never did they tell him that the only evil and danger was in 
themselves; that they alone were the prisoners and the betrayers; 
that they - they alone - were responsible for what was being done 
in the world.
And they told the child to starve and to kill the child that was within 
him; for only by doing this could he become a useful and adjusted 
member of the community which they had prepared for him.
And this time, alas, they did not lie.
And with the death of the child was born a thing that had neither 
the character of a man nor the character of a child, but was a 
horrible and monstrous parody of the two; and it is in this world 
now that the flesh of man’s spirit lies twisted and despoiled under 
the indifferent stars.
When we were here together in a place we did not know, nor one 
another.
O green the bit of warm grass between our teeth. O beautiful the hair 
of our mortal goddess on the indifferent wind. 


When will You come? 
Will I be found, before my earthly life is done? 

Will I experience Your Resurrection Power
and observe how sin You have conquered & devoured? 

It’s a win-win scenario, for me, in any case –
As I long to see Your radiance, revealed at Heaven’s pace.

To enter Your gates with humble willingness
is real, knowing that I’m clothed by Your Righteousness.

When will You come? 
Will I be found, before Death has finally succumbed? 

Although Your timetable has not been uncovered, 
thankfully, Your Grace I’ve discovered.

To witness Your Return, within the span of Eternity’s time.

When Winchester races first took their beginning
It is said the good people forgot their old Saint
Not applying at all for the leave of Saint Swithin
And that William of Wykeham's approval was faint. 

The races however were fixed and determined
The company came and the Weather was charming
And nobody saw any future alarming.-- 

But when the old Saint was informed of these doings
He made but one Spring from his Shrine to the Roof
Of the Palace which now lies so sadly in ruins
And then he addressed them all standing aloof. 

'Oh! subjects rebellious! Oh Venta depraved
When once we are buried you think we are gone
But behold me immortal! By vice you're enslaved
You have sinned and must suffer, ten farther he said 

These races and revels and dissolute measures
With which you're debasing a neighboring Plain
Let them stand--You shall meet with your curse in your pleasures
Set off for your course, I'll pursue with my rain. 

Ye cannot but know my command o'er July
Henceforward I'll triumph in shewing my powers
Shift your race as you will it shall never be dry
The curse upon Venta is July in showers--'. 

When winter dawn smiles again, oh my dear
hand in hand we shall be walking near
heart in heart we shall be messaging
soaked with love and warmth
we shall be flying together.

when winter dawn smiles again, oh my dear
her silky clouds flying over the blue gown
you shall caress my greying tresses smoothly
leaning against your manly love I shall weep
coated with your affection brimmed with tears

when winter dawn smiles again, oh my dear
we shall lie at the grassy beds hush and silent
watching the mating birds with love and innocence
our aching limbs after years ardour shall sing
with our teenage heart blurting out silly musings

when winter dawn smiles again, oh my dear
we will watch the violin leaves shiver with winter's ecstasy
and the veena trees squeal in delight touched by her fantasy
we shall weave the magic house made of intoxicant dreams
yet shall anoint our ageing limbs with balms full of intimacy

when winter dawn oh my dear smiles again
I shall be yours like a rabbit mute
you can put me into your cap all soft
I shall be all quiet and silent just aloft
my head to foot drenched with charm
that you shall speak of with your hugs and calm.

when winter dawn smiles again oh my dear
I shall float in the boat to heaven with you
my body weightless, my heart filled with softest love
I shall freeze with love you spread, your body radiant with
my silly soul shall cringe at your feet with joy sinking rich. 

Question arises on us and our sovereign social institution
When womanhood dies in the necropolis of prostitution 
Swindling activities supported by some men
Time again and again by men insane 
All sorts of crime making and breaking economies
Men having mind of sick physiognomies
The structural connotations might go deep
Can't be washed off the stain on the mental map
No matter how profusely you weep
She always feel enfeeble and handicap
The system of justice does great injustice
People come to notice but no real justice
Can be done to reverse the action
Aftermath of heinous action
Mal-functional maligned genetics
Dead in beauty or the aesthetics 
That draws in the attention to your beauty 
With the best appreciated and secured duty
In the despair nothing to say but gape
Opportunity to condemn has given the name-rape 
Rape has been a volatile issue in ethics and moral
Momentary pleasure, mundane and corporal
When the women have the freedom to drink sip after sips 
Get boozed down every weekends being betrayed in relationships
Stress in jobs, insecurity, family issues
Pray for once and legacy continues
Get drunk and get enjoyment or screwed 
As an unofficial prostitute, she is viewed 
No chance of retake, life is not picture-motion
She finds someone who could cater to her emotions
This kind of woman is also threats for any society
 Freedom is given to both men and women from government
Right is right but there is responsibility and duty
But everybody has their respective government inside
Whether you expose, get exposed or hide
It's all depend on the your dream and scheme
How strong or weak one is with his/her beliefs and self-esteem
Question arises on us and our sovereign social institution
When womanhood dies in the necropolis of prostitution 

(शशिकांत निशांत शर्मा ‘साहिल')So new is this feeling
Writing the message nth time
And on the next second¦ Deleting

So much I have got to say
But the only god damn question is
Will I possibly find a way? 

No idea where am I heading
But I carry a single ticket
That ugly truth left me shredding

But can we end this story here? 
Rather than holding a compass
That points at nowhere? 

Last statement didn't make me glad
As I just realized
Expressing feelings was an idea so bad

It's becoming even more uncertain
Wonder why
Doesn't œSomething have a hold button? 

Bloody whole rhyme is so lame
Didn't find a way out
Just hardened the game

Difficulties and hitches are true
But when you'll need me
My presence will be felt by you

The end is always marked by a sigh
I can't wave you back
It's too hard to say goodbye


WHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;
And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 

When you come to me, unbidden,
Beckoning me
To long-ago rooms,
Where memories lie.

Offering me, as to a child, an attic,
Gatherings of days too few.
Baubles of stolen kisses.
Trinkets of borrowed loves.
Trunks of secret words,

I CRY. 

When you gave your money to that sad woman, didn't you ask yourselves where you'd go afterwards? 
	„To heavens, to heavens, " you shouted all together.
	„No, no, much farther, much farther, " replied  she. 

When you go away the wind clicks around to the north
The painters work all day but at sundown the paint falls
Showing the black walls
The clock goes back to striking the same hour
That has no place in the years


And at night wrapped in the bed of ashes
In one breath I wake
It is the time when the beards of the dead get their growth
I remember that I am falling
That I am the reason
And that my words are the garment of what I shall never be
Like the tucked sleeve of a one-armed boy—And when you have forgotten the bright bedclothes on a Wednesday and a Saturday,
And most especially when you have forgotten Sunday—
When you have forgotten Sunday halves in bed,
Or me sitting on the front-room radiator in the limping afternoon
Looking off down the long street
To nowhere,
Hugged by my plain old wrapper of no-expectation
And nothing-I-have-to-do and I’m-happy-why?
And if-Monday-never-had-to-come—
When you have forgotten that, I say,
And how you swore, if somebody beeped the bell,
And how my heart played hopscotch if the telephone rang;
And how we finally went in to Sunday dinner,
That is to say, went across the front room floor to the ink-spotted table in the southwest corner
To Sunday dinner, which was always chicken and noodles
Or chicken and rice
And salad and rye bread and tea
And chocolate chip cookies—
I say, when you have forgotten that,
When you have forgotten my little presentiment
That the war would be over before they got to you;
And how we finally undressed and whipped out the light and flowed into bed,
And lay loose-limbed for a moment in the week-end
Bright bedclothes,
Then gently folded into each other—
When you have, I say, forgotten all that,
Then you may tell,
Then I may believe
You have forgotten me well. 

When you left
You took apart of me with you
That part I can never get back
I lost all hope
I'm going to fall
Now you can take that all back
Have you not cause enough pain for me
Why must you be you
Stop takeing my loved ones 
Its just not fair


When you see the color red
Do you see me bloody and dead
When you see the color red
Do you picture me free of dread
What do you see
Do you see yourself hurting me
What do you see
Do you give a chance to be
When you see the color red
Did you see the rose dead
When you see the color red
Do you love me or am I just dead


I'm  sorry  if  I  doubt  it,  
Your  plan  to  tell  the  truth.
I  hear  you  might  try  charging.
Perhaps,  set  up  a  booth.

If  you  do  I'll  surely  pay
To  witness  how  it  goes.
Truth,  when  coming  from  your  mouth; 
I  wonder  if  it  glows.

At  that  time,  I'll  surely  see
The  consequence  it  brings.
You  with  angels  at  your  side
And  other  wondrous  things.

Pigs  in  flight  around  the  town.
Blue  moons  seen  everywhere.
And  unicorns  and  mermaids
Just  lounging  here  and  there.

A  pot  of  gold  and  rainbows
Near  Santa's  magic  sleigh.
Aliens  from  outer  space
Would  surely  come  that  day.

I  wouldn't  miss  the  marriage
Of  Hillary  and  Starr.
A  Twiggy,  Oprah  Winfrey.
Bill  Gates,  a  movie  star.

Yes,  I  surely  doubt  it  all
Could  ever  come  to  pass.
Would  celebrate  en  masse.

And  I  would  stand  among  them
In  lipstick  and  a  thong, 
Prompting  them  to  join  me  in  
A  hot  tub  sing-a-long.

Wonders  would  not  cease,  you  see.
In  fact,  the  truth  would  die.
For  when  it  passes  by  your  lips, 
It  then  becomes  a  lie. 


I will give you a poem when you wake tomorrow.
It will be a peaceful poem.
It won’t make you sad.
It won’t make you miserable.
It will simply be a poem to give you
When you wake tomorrow.

It was not written by myself alone.
I cannot lay claim to it.
I found it in your body.
In your smile I found it.
Will you recognise it?

You will find it under your pillow.
When you open the cupboard it will be there.
You will blink in astonishment,
Shout out, ‘How it trembles!
Its nakedness is startling! How fresh it tastes!’

We will have it for breakfast;
On a table lit by loving,
At a place reserved for wonder.
We will give the world a kissing open
When we wake tomorrow.

We will offer it to the sad landlord out on the balcony.
To the dreamers at the window.
To the hand waving for no particular reason
We will offer it.
An amazing and most remarkable thing,
We will offer it to the whole human race
Which walks in us
When we wake tomorrow. 



I can still remember all the pain that I felt, I can't believe that back then the thought of you, or sound of your voice could make me melt

I can still remember all the pain that you caused and how in the end my heart was the one shattered in pieces on the floor, but what I can't believe is that after all that I just wanted you more

It was like I was the stupid moth to your flame, and in the end I got burned and have only myself to blame, I knew I couldn't have you but that didn't stop me from wanting you, I guess I hoped maybe deep down inside you wanted me too

I knew from the start liking you was pointless, but that didn't stop me and in the end I was the one cleaning up my big mess

To make matters worse you knew how I felt all along, I pegged you for a kind, sweet guy but in the end I guess I was wrong

Back then it felt like the worse kind of pain and it felt like i couldn't go on, but looking back on it now, I realized it made me smarter and it made me strong

So in the end even though I was the that was one hurting oh so bad, I must admit as I look back on it I'm kind of glad, because you taught me a valuable lesson in what happens when you want something you can't have


When you were born in this world 
Everyone laughed while you cried 
Conduct NOT yourself in manner such 
That they laugh when you are gone 


Kabir's mind got cleansed like the holy Ganges water 
Now everyone follows, saying Kabir Kabir 

Guru the washer man, disciple is the cloth 
Wash the mind on foundation firm 
To realize the glow of Truth 

Alive one sees, alive one knows 
Thus crave for salvation when full of life 
Alive you did not cut the noose of binding actions 
Hoping liberation with death! 

Inexpressible is the story of Love 
It cannot be revealed by words 
Like the dumb eating sweet-meat 
Only smiles, the sweetness he cannot tell 

Worry is the bandit that eats into one's heart 
What the doctor can do, what remedy to impart? 

Says Kabir 
Don't be so proud and vain 
Looking at your high mansion 
Death makes one lie on bare land 
And grass will grow thereon 

Says Kabir 
Don't be so proud and vain 
The clutches of Time are dark 
Who knows where shall it kill 
Whether at home or abroad 

Says Kabir 
By my doing nothing happens 
What I don't does come to pass 
If anything happens as if my doing 
Then truly it is done by someone else 

Like the pupil in the eyes 
Ignorant do not know this fact 
They search Him outside 

First the pangs of separation 
Next grows the thirst for Love 
Says Kabir then only hope 
The union to materialize


When your bedroom for you very far

When already you stand -nearby by bar, 

When you will finds so well corner's chair, 

When the waiter hears you without words, 

When cigarettes did not remain in a pocket, 

When a pen for- covers was lost - naked, 

When behind windows the old moon to you talks, 

And when for forgotten pains promises again, 

When swings in a glass- so lovely, of red wine, 

When its redness doesn't remind only sin's & blood, 

When now feet itself go back well on familiar lane, 

& your bedroom not seems for you any more far. 


Whomsoever I meet greet on the way
he moans and unzips a bag of sorrow-
one more atrocious than the other. 


wherever
I turn my eyes no sight makes me cheerful
so distracted are the eyes
revealing what is happening in the mind, a birth given
miracle, have they converted into a pain
incubating machine. 

Whence cometh such tender rapture?
Those curls--they are not the first ones
I've smoothened, and I've already
Known lips--that were darker than yours.

The stars have risen and faded,
--Whence cometh such tender rapture?--
And eyes have risen and faded 
In face of these eyes of mine

I'd never yet hearkened unto
Such songs in the depths of darkness,
--Whence cometh such tender rapture?--
My head on the bard's own breast

Whence cometh such tender rapture?
And what's to be done with it, artful
Young vagabound, passing minstrel
With lashes--to long to say. 


Whenever we are apart
Separated by endless miles
Seas, deserts or phone call
I think of you

And then I wonder
In whose arms you slept last night
I wonder with whom
You whispered all those sweet words
And my heart breaks into two

Whenever we are apart
Separated by walls, 
Words or fences unintentionally built
I think of you

And then I wonder
Whose fingers raked your cornrows 
I wonder
Whose thumbs caressed your lips
And my heart breaks into two

Day after day
These feelings resurface
And time after time
They have left me heartbroken


There's a place the man always say
Come in here, child
No cause you should weep
Wolf never catch such a rabbit
Golden hair never turn white with grief 
Come in here, child
No cause you should moan 
Brother never hurt his brother 
Nobody here ever wander without a home
There must be some such place somewhere
But I never heard of it


Where are my glasses, where did they go? 
I’ve searched high, and I’ve searched low
I looked on the shelf and behind the TV
Where, oh where can my glasses be? 

I’ve looked on top of the table, behind the door
Inside the cupboard and inside the drawer
Beside the lounge and under it too
I went outside and checked inside an old shoe

I walked down the hallway and up the stairs
In front of me was a bicycle lying right there
I walked around it and jumped over the toys
Left there by those most lazy of boys

I walked past a doorway, then crawled through a hole
Which led to a cupboard that only contained bowls
I’ve looked everywhere, under each and every bed
The only place I forgot was on top of my head


They came in to the little town 
A semi-naked band subdued and silent 
All that remained of their tribe. 
They came here to the place of their old bora ground 
Where now the many white men hurry about like ants. 
Notice of the estate agent reads: 'Rubbish May Be Tipped Here'. 
Now it half covers the traces of the old bora ring. 
'We are as strangers here now, but the white tribe are the strangers. 
We belong here, we are of the old ways. 
We are the corroboree and the bora ground, 
We are the old ceremonies, the laws of the elders. 
We are the wonder tales of Dream Time, the tribal legends told. 
We are the past, the hunts and the laughing games, the wandering camp fires. 
We are the lightening bolt over Gaphembah Hill 
Quick and terrible, 
And the Thunderer after him, that loud fellow. 
We are the quiet daybreak paling the dark lagoon. 
We are the shadow-ghosts creeping back as the camp fires burn low. 
We are nature and the past, all the old ways 
Gone now and scattered. 
The scrubs are gone, the hunting and the laughter. 
The eagle is gone, the emu and the kangaroo are gone from this place. 
The bora ring is gone. 
The corroboree is gone. 
And we are going.

'Where are you? 




Where are you? 

Calls out this heart

Flying about in busy business

Letting your rose unattended wilt

Is it fair; ever fair your highness? 


The busy bee it tangent flew

past the bunch of fresh roses

youth and freshness

Pervaded his nostrils

making him pause.  .


But in this air conditioned room

No. . 

no place. . 

no space

Space for this romantic at heart! ! 

It was a meet of spirited spirits in quest

Where the languor of the finer emotions? 


Busier than bee! ! 

Busier than million ants. .. 

In team venture
Had he any time for her? ? 

The skies are fading into night
Heart is sagging
Loosing its battle with the Tears
Strong and steady spilling
To fill the space
To add chill to bones
Already with neglect left cold! 


I never realized your love
I never realized your feelings
Don't know where are you now 
About you I can't stop thinking
I wanna feel your touch on my body
Come right here and tell me you love me
I was a fool
I let you go away
Far Away from me
No I don't feel the same
Like I used to feel
Where are you now? 
I miss you
Hold you tight
Wanna kiss you
Where are you now? 


I'll never find love like yours
I'll never find someone who could care like you used to do
I regret all the mistakes I did
I hope you forgive and come back to me


I let you go away
Far away from me
No I don't feel the same
Like I used to feel
Where are you now? 
I miss you
Hold you tight
Wanna kiss you
Where are you now.


'Friend, whereto art thou come?' Thus Verity;
Of each that to the world's sad Olivet
Comes with no multitude, but alone by night,
Lit with the one torch of his lifted soul,
Seeking her that he may lay hands on her;
Thus: and waits answer from the mouth of deed.
Truth is a maid, whom men woo diversely;
This, as a spouse; that, as a light-o'-love,
To know, and having known, to make his brag.
But woe to him that takes the immortal kiss,
And not estates her in his housing life,
Mother of all his seed! So he betrays,
Not Truth, the unbetrayable, but himself:
And with his kiss's rated traitor-craft,
The Haceldama of a plot of days
He buys, to consummate his Judasry
Therein with Judas' guerdon of despair. 


WHERE be ye going, you Devon maid?
      And what have ye there i' the basket?
Ye tight little fairy, just fresh from the dairy,
      Will ye give me some cream if I ask it?

I love your meads, and I love your flowers,
      And I love your junkets mainly,
But 'hind the door, I love kissing more,
      O look not so disdainly!

I love your hills, and I love your dales,
      And I love your flocks a-bleating;
But O, on the heather to lie together,
      With both our hearts a-beating!

I'll put your basket all safe in a nook,
      Your shawl I'll hang up on this willow,
And we will sigh in the daisy's eye,
      And kiss on a grass-green pillow. 


Have you ever ventured
Beyond the dreams 
Where the sulking night
Angry with her lovers, the moon and the stars
Dabs her bare body with ashes
And dances around a bonfire? 

Have you ever peeped behind eyelashes
Into tired blue eyes 
Where a whole world of woe
Swims in spaces unfathomed? 

Have you ever spent a day
Under the greenwood trees
Erect sentry-like on each side of the road
Where the sun struggles 
To find its way? 

Have you ever asked
A wayfarer, a stranger
The directions to the house
Of the one
Whose waning footprints
The winds kiss
Wandering about from town to town? 



Where do you search me? 
I am with you 
Not in pilgrimage, nor in icons 
Neither in solitudes 
Not in temples, nor in mosques 
Neither in Kaba nor in Kailash 
I am with you O man 
I am with you 
Not in prayers, nor in meditation 
Neither in fasting 
Not in yogic exercises 
Neither in renunciation 
Neither in the vital force nor in the body 
Not even in the ethereal space 
Neither in the womb of Nature 
Not in the breath of the breath 
Seek earnestly and discover 
In but a moment of search 
Says Kabir, Listen with care 
Where your faith is, I am there. 


Where does Love 
go when Love
turns cold? 
Oh, don't let the past 
take its hold 
stand bold 
and never let 
your love grow cold.


Cool gales shall fan that glade'

The Pierhead where you walked will be made a park 
restricted to lovers under 


Peasants will be found merrymaking after the storm in 
Canning St where you walked 
The station where we first arrived at night 
Will be preserved for the nation 

With the echo of your footsteps still sounding in the empty 
roof

`Where'er you tread
The Blushing flower shall rise'


The alleyway where we read poems to dustbins after closing time 
The kitchens where we quarrelled at parties 
The kitchen where two strangers first kissed at a party full of strangers 
The ticket barrier where we said goodnight so many times 
The cobblestones in front of the station 
The pub where the kindly old waiter 
Always knows what we want to drink - 


ALL SHALL BURST INTO BLOOM 
SPROUTING FLOWERS BRIGHTER THAN PLASTIC ONES 
IN WOOLWORTHS 
Daffodils and chrysanthemums, rhododendrons and 
snowdrops, tulips and roses 
cobblestones bursting with lilies­of­the­valley

`And all things flourish'

Whole streets where you walk are paved with soft grass 
so the rain will never go through your shoes again 
Zebra crossings made of lilies 
Belisha beacons made of orange blossom 
Bus stops huge irises 
Traffic lights made of snapdragons
`Trees where you sit
Shall crowd into a shade'

even in Piccadilly 
stations covered in flowers yellow like the paint you once 
got in your hair 
Oak trees growing everywhere we've kissed 
Will still be there when I've forgotten what you look like 
And you don't remember me at all 
Copies of your letters to me on blue paper 
England 
Copies of your poems stamped on eggs instead of lions 
We will walk forever in the darkness under fern leaves
`Trees where you sit shall crowd into a shade'


Where forlorn sunsets flare and fade
On desolate sea and lonely sand,
Out of the silence and the shade
What is the voice of strange command
Calling you still, as friend calls friend
With love that cannot brook delay
To rise and follow the ways that wend
Over the hills and far away?

Hark in the city, street on street
A roaring reach of death and life,
Of vortices that clash and fleet
And ruin in appointed strife,
Hark to it calling, calling clear,
Calling until you cannot stay
From dearer things than your own most dear
Over the hills and far away?

Out of the sound of the ebb-and-flow,
Out of the sight of the lamp and star,
It calls you where the good winds blow,
And the unchanging meadows are;
From faded hopes and hopes agleam,
It calls you, calls you night and day
Beyond the dark into the dream
Over the hills and far away. 

More than where from tis
where you are heading that counts 
Your best is the key


Dark brown is the river,
Golden is the sand.
It flows along for ever,
With trees on either hand.

Green leaves a-floating,
Castles of the foam,
Boats of mine a-boating - 
Where will all come home?

On goes the river
And out past the mill,
Away down the valley,
Away down the hill.

Away down the river,
A hundred miles or more,
Other little children
Shall bring my boats ashore. 

Always begins where
Human ability ends


Here I am, sitting at the table.
It’s been a year, don’t know how you were able
to keep me missing you all this time.

You walk in, sit down across me.
We small-talk, weather and the family.
So careful not to cross the line.

Because I know you don’t want to remember, 
when it’s still so hard to forget.
We cried all night, but I left you in the end.


So hear me out; I’m sorry for saying that I didn’t want you in my life when 
I was so wrong.
I regret it–you’re where I belong.
Wanted to break free when actually it was me who couldn’t commit to anything. 
I was so wrong, 
and I regret it, take my hand and take me home.
I regret it, ‘cause you’re where I belong.

This week I’ve been thinking about a memory, 
playing back that one weekend at the rally, 
when we stayed in tents and I watched you sleep.

But you’ve been keeping your distance since I said goodbye.
You’re looking very wary and I understand why; 
this time the scar’s too deep.

Because last time was enough 
for you to swear not to let me in again.
You were devoted, but at the time I didn’t care.

I watch your blue eyes–so guarded, your lips turned so far down.
You clench your hands and scrape your chair against the ground, 
standing up to turn around.
Did you take offence to what I said? 
I promise you this beating heart isn’t dead.
But then you look at me and I tremble at the sound; 

You say you want to love me, but you can’t.
You never meant to hurt me, so you hope I understand.


But hear me out; I’m sorry for saying that I didn’t want you in my life when 
I was so wrong.
I regret it–you’re where I belong.
Wanted to break free when actually it was me who couldn’t commit to anything. 
I was so wrong, 
and I regret it, take my hand and take me home.
I regret it, turn around ‘cause this heart is torn.
I regret it, loving you is where I belong.


In your arms is where I belong. 

In my deepest silent thoughts
There you always are
Shining as a star in the dark
Lighting my face with a smile
As the moon to an evening sky
Spotting where I can find you

Never has there been a time
This heart of mine got so lonely
And your thoughts come to my mind
That I didn't give a warming smile
That lit all the candles in my heart
And showed where I can find you

My happiness and all that matters
Are found within your presence
In the beauty of your sweet words
And in the fond way you smile at me
When I stare wordless at your face
Searching for where I can find you


The summer weather
Knocks out body and spirit
Eats up energy

life is too many a thing
to too many people

at the same time
it remains nothing to some

some see it in flame
and burn themselves down into ashes

some see it in water
and drown themselves into fossils

but I see it in
what I plucked from the bush fresh and red

and knee down gave it to you
last Sunday night. 


Where innocent bright-eyed daisies are, 
With blades of grass between, 
Each daisy stands up like a star 
Out of a sky of green. 

She sat under the acacia tree
her mind lost in thoughts
a decision had to be made
a tough decision it was

Where is home? 
the sweet home that i have not known before
the home i so wish to return to
a home that i hope to like


On eighth March, it took off for Beijing.
Till now no trace of landing.
Where vanished, my flying plane? 
It never touched Atlantic Ocean, 
Has Bermuda triangle moved from place
or the plane has gone to space! 
Has Authority of Aeronautics Space
of any other planet hijacked! 
The whole word is sympathized.
Search operations, they did expedite.
Till date they have not got the clue.
Oh! we all saw hundreds of swans flew; 
higher and higher and higher.
Let, them have peace and grace of You, 
their kins vigor, relieved; to get through. 


My nieces, while we enjoyed our festive season
They debated, debated and debated-the debate was to your peril my darlings
They are all adults- may be with daughters -May be without - but the debate was loop-holed
Your consent period to enjoy sexuality may have a full-house of men and women of integrity as debaters
Probably not even as full as matters national security debates
They want you young and juicier-is what they literary said is sweet
Now, they practically want to be sweetest



Should they debate, debate and debate more
We will have no legal obligation to protect you my nieces
While they debate, I want to remind you my dear nieces
That Sexual Rights are enshrined in the declaration of sexual rights
When you are of age like auntie, 
You will notice that that declarations state, recognize, affirm, reaffirm
And underscores matters -sexual but we leave you to-


Make your own decisions about being sexual (or not) 
The right to tell anyone that you are not comfortable being hugged or kissed in certain ways
The right to ask a partner if she or he has been examined for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
The right to tell a partner what you would like sexually
The right to stop sexual activity at any time-including during or just before intercourse
The right to sexual privacy, to sexual equity, to sexual health care to sexual information based upon scientific inquiry to emotional sexual expression


Auntie is old school but she has the right to inform her nieces- for rights and obligations are intertwined. 


The cloud of time covers the horizon.
It's me, I come at the end without eyes
as the condemned Oedipus
and I yearning the shelter of the atheistic monks
who have no history and live in the road.

I have crossed in seconds sexual territories
- small logos hidden by gods -
So now, I am hanging in days like over an assembly line
where it finishes both the product and life
while I listening to silence and I see in white.

What I write are leaves and fruits with no time, 
but my memories shall return to the tree of blankness
when I will cross the lonely thought


once touched the earth
but the Catholics
had got there before me
and obscured His footprints
with arches, buttresses,
gold and incense.


I couldn't see for
concrete and collection boxes,
for postcards and guide books.

So I looked further down.
I looked to the ground.
But the ground was thirty feet
higher than back in A. 

D.

I looked down, down to my feet,
my legs,arms,chest.

Where lies the land to which the ship would go?


And where the land she travels from? Away,
Far, far behind, is all that they can say.

On sunny noons upon the deck's smooth face,
Link'd arm in arm, how pleasant here to pace;
Or, o'er the stern reclining, watch below
The foaming wake far widening as we go.

On stormy nights when wild north-westers rave,
How proud a thing to fight with wind and wave!
The dripping sailor on the reeling mast
Exults to bear, and scorns to wish it past.

Where lies the land to which the ship would go?


And where the land she travels from? Away,
Far, far behind, is all that they can say? 


In a running train, 
sitting opposite, he and she
spent their journey, 
little engaged in talks, 
but mostly outside in gaze.
Husband and wife, they’re.

Another pair likewise
spent their journey
in incessant talks, 
often by inventing, 
conscious of each other.
Husband and wife, they’re not.




One's death creates a vacuum
Only in one's children's hearts
And grand-kids to an extent.
It would not be found elsewhere. 






Love begins
Where fear ends
These two shall
Never meet


All the words that I utter,
And all the words that I write,
Must spread out their wings untiring,
And never rest in their flight,
Till they come where your sad, sad heart is,
And sing to you in the night,
Beyond where the waters are moving,
Storm-darken’d or starry bright. 

Tomorrow will bring sets my
Focus on each now


Seared upon my soul for ever more
That break of dawn upon a summer morn
As I made my way along that rocky shore
Strewn with remnants from a ragging storm
When through a rising mist of gray - so forlorn
I saw a badly broken sinking ship
With canvas wings of white so sadly torn 
There beneath those majestic purple cliffs

And as that mighty fearless ocean roared 
With salty breezy breath so filled with scorn
I saw it rise up from the ocean floor
Wrapped in a velvet coat so frayed and worn 
A red, red, rose impaled upon a thorn 
Where passion bled like rain from ruby lips 
Upon a vivid memory reborn 
There beneath those majestic purple cliffs 
 
The wind - it whispered - in my ear - Lenore		
As black clouds in the sky began to form		
Into a face I’d never seen before			
With hollow cheeks that endless tears adorned	
That fell in frozen crystal drops so foreign. .. 		
Then from those clouds his face began to slip  	
And I cried  the tears of a women scorned 			
There beneath those majestic purple cliffs		

Lenore, the love he would forever mourn
That from his pen on page in words did drip
As I read his poetry and love was born
There beneath those majestic purple cliffs. 

Where once the waters of your face
Spun to my screws, your dry ghost blows,
The dead turns up its eye;
Where once the mermen through your ice
Pushed up their hair, the dry wind steers
Through salt and root and roe.

Where once your green knots sank their splice
Into the tided cord, there goes
The green unraveller,
His scissors oiled, his knife hung loose
To cut the channels at their source
And lay the wet fruits low.

Invisible, your clocking tides
Break on the lovebeds of the weeds;
The weed of love's left dry;
There round about your stones the shades
Of children go who, from their voids,
Cry to the dolphined sea.

Dry as a tomb, your coloured lids
Shall not be latched while magic glides
Sage on the earth and sky;
There shall be corals in your beds
There shall be serpents in your tides,
Till all our sea-faiths die. 

In presence of anyone
You are not at ease, rather tense.
Only in seclusion, 
You are at ease and in rest.
You get it when in the toilet




Where's the Poet? show him! show him,
Muses nine! that I may know him.
'Tis the man who with a man
Is an equal, be he King,
Or poorest of the beggar-clan
Or any other wonderous thing
A man may be 'twixt ape and Plato;
'Tis the man who with a bird,
Wren or Eagle, finds his way to
All its instincts; he hath heard
The Lion's roaring, and can tell
What his horny throat expresseth,
And to him the Tiger's yell
Come articulate and presseth
Or his ear like mother-tongue. 


This is my delight, 
thus to wait and watch at the wayside 
where shadow chases light 
and the rain comes in the wake of the summer.


Messengers, with tidings from unknown skies, 
greet me and speed along the road. 
My heart is glad within, 
and the breath of the passing breeze is sweet. 

From dawn till dusk I sit here before my door, 
and I know that of a sudden 
the happy moment will arrive when I shall see. 

In the meanwhile I smile and I sing all alone. 
In the meanwhile the air is filling with the perfume of promise.


'_Where shall we land you, sweet_?'

All listlessly we float
Out seaward in the boat
That beareth Love.
Our sails of purest snow
Bend to the blue below
And to the blue above.
Where shall we land?

We drift upon a tide
Shoreless on every side,
Save where the eye
Of Fancy sweeps far lands
Shelved slopingly with sands
Of gold and porphyry.
Where shall we land?

The fairy isles we see,
Loom up so mistily--
So vaguely fair,
We do not care to break
Fresh bubbles in our wake
To bend our course for there.
Where shall we land?

The warm winds of the deep
Have lulled our sails to sleep,
And so we glide
Careless of wave or wind,
Or change of any kind,
Or turn of any tide.
Where shall we land?

We droop our dreamy eyes
Where our reflection lies
Steeped in the sea,
And, in an endless fit
Of languor, smile on it
And its sweet mimicry.
Where shall we land?

I know not any place
So fair as this--
Swung here between the blue
Of sea and sky, with you
To ask me, with a kiss,
'Where shall we land.


'When a man stole a woman
She is branded mud and he a stud.
She is reviled and he, envied.
She is labeled a harlot and he, a starlet.
It is here that women must fight
Against the scale that is skewed
Towards men to their advantage.




Where Spring, the lord of the seasons, reigneth,
there the Unstruck Music sounds of itself,
There the streams of light flow in all directions; 
Few are the men who can cross to that shore! 

There, where millions of Krishnas stand with hands folded,
Where millions of Vishnus bow their heads,
Where millions of Brahmas are reading the Vedas,
Where millions of Shivas are lost in contemplation,
Where millions of Indras dwell in the sky,
Where the demi-gods and the munis are unnumbered,
and the scent of sandal and flowers dwells in those deeps. 


WHERE the bee sucks, there suck I:	
  In a cowslip's bell I lie; 	
There I couch when owls do cry.	
On the bat's back I do fly.	
After summer merrily:
  Merrily, merrily, shall I live now
  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. 


The old farm-home is Mother's yet and mine,
And filled it is with plenty and to spare--,
But we are lonely here in life's decline,
Though fortune smiles around us everywhere:
We look across the gold
Of the harvests, as of old--
The corn, the fragrant clover, and the hay;
But most we turn our gaze,
As with eyes of other days,
To the orchard where the children used to play.

O from our life's full measure
And rich hoard of worldly treasure
We often turn our weary eyes away,
And hand in hand we wander
Down the old path winding yonder
To the orchard where the children used to play.

Our sloping pasture-lands are filled with herds;
The barn and granary-bins are bulging o'ver;
The grove's a paradise of singing birds--
The woodland brook leaps laughing by the door;
Yet lonely, lonely still,
Let us prosper as we will,
Our old hearts seem so empty everyway--
We can only through a mist
See the faces we have kissed
In the orchard where the children used to play.

O from our life's full measure
And rich hoard of worldly treasure
We often turn our weary eyes away,
And hand in hand we wander
Down the old path winding yonder
To the orchard where the children used to play. 


It all stemmed from the base of a leaf
As small as the belief that I might never 
Meet someone like you
With your labyrinth thumbprint
Reading the maple veins like a map
Of all the rivers streaming North
Carrying my body home again
And again the cornstalks grow
Where our feet once were 
While our hands solved the mystery
Of the crop circles in your hair


Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high 
Where knowledge is free 
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments 
By narrow domestic walls 
Where words come out from the depth of truth 
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection 
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way 
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit 
Where the mind is led forward by thee 
Into ever-widening thought and action 
Into that heaven of freedom,
 let my country awake


Man refuses to learn from the past mistakes.
Having bitten by women after woman, 
He still goes woman after woman




There is a place where the sidewalk ends
and before the street begins,
and there the grass grows soft and white,
and there the sun burns crimson bright,
and there the moon-bird rests from his flight
to cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
and the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow
and watch where the chalk-white arrows go
to the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,
the place where the sidewalk ends. 

Throughout life we learn
Conceptual knowledge and life
Both make the truth known


Where these politicians are taking us for? 
Do they think they are materials of hard core? 
No fear and sensitivity in their approach
What can we think of or do away with such people? 

They claim to be saint politicians  
Grab only limited things from public fans
Keep under constant threat with bribery
Now allowing coming out from slavery

Heavy thrust on passing convenient legislations
That can build their empire with sound relations
Enough of money to siphoned off from treasury
And later on to be spent on abroad visits and luxury

Public may die of starvation and under nourishment
No will power to offer resistance with popular movement
Whole democratic powers hacked to their advantage
Skillfully drafted the clauses for with efficiency to manage

Farmer are committing suicide with everything to loose
Politicians are flourishing with level playfield to choose
Amassing wealth and fortunes over night
Where is the will power to protect and fight? 

Innocents are sprayed in the street
Demonstrators are button charged and greeted
Where is the respect for freedom of speech? 
Who can come forward for lessons to teach? 

The clock may not stop pendulum
The resistance maybe offered minimum
If that is not heeded to and honored
Some harsh provisions may be explored

No lust for wealth is satisfied
It is on and on and never fulfilled
It may not end if not forced politically
This can be done by staging the rallies

The political weapon must be used
The violent methods must be refused
It may end the tyrannical rule
Only you take care of not becoming tool

Raise the banner to full extent
Show the readiness with full consent
The political struggles are full of hardships 
It may pull you down from the sailing ships

It requires great courage and sacrifice
It has so much to do with given promises
It may come down to laying down of life
Leaving behind parents, children and wife


Bullet or a bomb 
Both are blind and numb 
Wall or a roof 
Body or a soul 
Wherever they hit 
They make a pit 
Make all foul 
Trees and flowers 
People like towers 
Concrete or soil 
Plastic or foil 
Glass or lumber 
In no time they spoil 
Scenes of love 
Peace and dove 
They aim to destroy 
Happiness and joy 
Whenever they explode 
It's life they erode 
Flesh and blood 
Spills like flood 
Limbs are found 
Spread on the ground 
Menfolk, womankind, 
Progenies altogether bind 
Innocent or cunning 
Waking or slumbering 
Standing or running 
Genius or goof 
Seek no proof 
Make no distinction 
Just one single shot 
Puts the whole world 
On the verge of extinction


Where to go for complaint? 
When king becomes blind and turn saint? 
When kingdom is handed over to wolves
Whole mystery surrounds and treachery involves


Is it wise to turn the kingdom into holy land? 
Leaving the subjects into the unholy hands? 
Allow anarchy and misery to prevail
All rights and freedom may also to curtail

These were the old divine rights of the kings
King was master and we the animals in rings
No voice to be heard with clipping of wings
Not to even murmur and allowed to sing

Kings used to abdicate power in favour
Such a mad race shrouded in glamour
Such was state and no worry for subject
Power or authority only main object

Kings have vanished but leaders are born
Only power game and principles torn
Who knows which side they may turn? 
Monarchy is over or likely to return

People still favour old king’s system
Voice was still heard-------
Thousands of leaders have come into being
Promises forgotten and no welfare to bring

King was accessible even within reach
Leaders have worries and no time to spare 
There is no use quality to compare

We have no choice but to live with evil
One may be less other may be more devil
Life is short and has to be compromised
When words are reneged initially promised

There is no use for blood to get boiled
Only strong resolves to get attempts foiled
Still nothing is slipped away and out of hand
Rule should prevail with respect to holy land


Right girl for right man 
But where to find such human
Equal feelings for her companion 
To spend time at ease in union 

Yes, it is not secret desire
Not woman alone but man too needs to admire
It is joint responsibility to pull a cart
Only life needs very good start

There will not be any criteria for selection 
It will just push and pull action 
If one likes a person, there may be a compromise
No one may try to look at and think who is wise? 

Yes partner is accepted without much choice
It is good will gesture and much of future promises
How will you overcome and stand against challenges? 
How will you prove honest sincere and ably manage? 

Despite all such good qualities if it does not work
Blame not almighty for blessings in words
It was bad luck that did worked
The good time did not click 

No one may claim to be perfect
Only action may be reflected in acts
It is resolve that may take you at shore
So think less and act more


Darkness is primitive to light.
Silence is primitive to sound.
Primitiveness is nearness
Find Him in graveyards at night
And not in light with bell ringing. 




Where to go, how to approach 
To get the meaning of wonder and surprise 
Nowhere have I found a mind without darkness 
Everywhere there is a fear, there is a doubt 

Where to go, whom to approach 
Who knows the meaning of beauty and absolute truth? 
Nowhere have I found a person who knows no ignorance 
No one I know whose words and actions never fail to match  

Where to go, why and for what 
Who knows the meaning of grace and fully understands life
Nowhere have I found one who does not complain of less 
No place have I known which is not broken up 
Into fragments with discontentment  

Where to go, whom to turn 
Who does not know the meaning of peace? 
Yet everywhere I find people to lose their clear stream of reason 
When in love and war they engage. 

Fish do not see the water.
Earthworms do not see the earth.
Germs do not see the air.
Man too does not see the All Pervasive.




We live here because the houses 
are clean, the lawns run 
right to the street 

and the streets run away. 
No one walks here. 
No one wakens at night or dies. 

The cars sit open-eyed 
in the driveways. 
The lights are on all day. 

At home forever, she has removed 
her long foreign names 
that stained her face like hair. 

She smiles at you, and you think 
tears will start from the corners 
of her mouth. Such a look 

of tenderness, you look away. 
She's your sister. Quietly she says, 
You're a shit, I'll get you for it. 

Money's the same, he says. 
He brings it home in white slabs 
that smell like soap. 

Throws them down 
on the table as though 
he didn't care. 

The children hear 
and come in from play glowing 
like honey and so hungry. 

With it all we have 
such a talent for laughing. 
We can laugh at anything. 

And we forget no one. 
She listens to mother 
on the phone, and he remembers 

the exact phrasing of a child's sorrows, 
the oaths taken by bear and tiger 
never to forgive. 

On Sunday we're having a party. 
The children are taken away 
in a black Dodge, their faces erased 

from the mirrors. Outside a scum 
is forming on the afternoon. 
A car parks but no one gets out. 

Brother is loading the fridge. 
Sister is polishing and spraying herself. 
Today we're having a party. 

For fun we talk about you. 
Everything's better for being said. 
That's a rule. 

This is going to be some long night, she says. 
How could you? How could you? 
For the love of mother, he says. 

There will be no dawn 
until the laughing stops. Even the pines 
are burning in the dark. 

Why do you love me? he says. 
Because. Because. 
You're best to me, she purrs. 

In the kitchen, in the closets, 
behind the doors, above the toilets, 
the calendars are eating it up. 

One blackened one watches you 
like another window. Why 
are you listening? it says. 

No one says, There's a war. 
No one says, Children are burning. 
No one says, Bizniz as usual. 

But you have to take it all back. 
You have to hunt through your socks 
and dirty underwear 

and crush each word. If you're serious 
you have to sit in the corner 
and eat ten new dollars. Eat'em. 

Whose rifles are brooding 
in the closet? What are 
the bolts whispering 

back and forth? And the pyramids 
of ammunition, so many 
hungry mouths to feed. 

When you hide in bed 
the revolver under the pillow 
smiles and shows its teeth. 

On the last night the children 
waken from the same dream 
of leaves burning. 

Two girls in the dark 
knowing there are no wolves 
or bad men in the room. 

Only electricity on the loose, 
the television screaming at itself, 
the dishwasher tearing its heart out. 

We're going away. The house 
is too warm. We disconnect 
the telephone. 

Bones, cans, broken dolls, bronzed shoes, 
ground down to face powder. Burn 
the toilet paper collected in the basement. 

Take back the bottles. 
The back stairs are raining glass. 
Cancel the milk. 

You may go now, says Cupboard. 
I won't talk, 
says Clock. 

Your bag is black and waiting. 
How can you leave your house? 
The stove hunches its shoulders, 

the kitchen table stares at the sky. 
You're heaving yourself out in the snow 
groping toward the front door. 




Where will I go when there is no one to save me, 
I see myself dieing of pain and sorrow, 
There is no place for me to run to, 
Hold me now and never let me go, 
I can see myself in the corner crying, 
I made many mistakes but this one went too far, 
Somewhere part of me is letting me its ok to make many mistakes, 
Where will I go when my world crumbles down, 
Who will I run to, 
How did I get here, 
I lost all hope in life or in death, 
Forever me, forever you
In death I can be free, 
In life I feel locked up, 
Where is my life headed to, 
Who will save me, 
Who will hold me when I break down and cry, 
Haven’t you figure it out that I have no where to go to but here at my home.


When I die, 
Where will I go? 
Do any of you
Really know? 

Will I laugh? 
Will I cry? 
Will I get
To say good-bye? 

Will I just
Wake up again? 
Or will I burn
For my sins? 

Will I have wings
That let me fly? 
Or has this all
Just been a lie? 

Will it matter 
When I've passed? 
Or will I just 
Be glad at last

No seeing you, 
nor' talking
all i hope is 
these feelings wont fade.


We have fallen into the darked highlights 
of love between us two.
Fading is deffinetly not on my priority
list of things to do.
Beneth the shadowd skin
with the heart
repeating the same old tune.
Striken cold&darkend rooms
the worst
combination of the two.
Will the feelings fade 
tears soak up or will you and me
plan a departuring plane
within us.
No questions asked or answers buried within
Ill leave this sinking
from
beginning to end. 


Delivered and moulded by my mother, 
I was identified with my father, 
Who, delivered and moulded by mother, 
Was identified with his father.

I go with my son; wife is an onlooker.
The son of my daughter I've no claim on.
In each generation, mother is removed
From the memory line of the family.

Let my name carry the name of mother
And of father behind it to the world.
Let me have the names of the grand mothers
And grandfathers on both sides in record.




Whereas at morning in a Jeweled Crown
I bit my fingers and was hard to please,
Having shook disaster till the fruit fell down
I feel tonight more happy and at ease:
Feet running in the corridors, men quick— 
Buckling their sword-belts, bumping down the stair,
Challenge, and rattling bridge-chain, and the click
Of hooves on pavement—this will clear the air.
Private this chamber as it has not been
In many a month of muffled hours; almost,
Lulled by the uproar, I could lie serene
And sleep, until all's won, until all's lost,
And the door's opened and the issue shown,
And I walk forth Hell's Mistress—or my own. 


Dharma is a Sanskrit word, ancient, 
With no common root word, unlike many, 
In the archaic Indo-European languages, 
And has exclusive Indic origin.

In Rig Veda, Dharma is used to mean
Something foundational to rituals.
In Manu Shastra, Dharma is handled
To refer to people's code of conduct.

In the Ramayana, Dharma refers
To human character forming virtue.
In the Mahabharata, Dharma holds
As the one that precedes power and wealth.


Dharma is foundational principle
Of the world and Life according to Buddha.
Dharma means the principles of movement and 
Adharma means Stillness from Jainism.

Kautilya states Dharma is humanity, 
Which will suffer without a just king.
Its translation in Greek is ‘eusebeia': 

Republic of India records Dharma
As religion in true sense as it is.
Dharma in a nut shell can be defined
As the righteous human character.




Even to the world's ends
sweetly sounded to my ears its tongue
in names of things and notions.
My eyes stared  the miracle of its lines
wondering at architecture's colemns  
and chisel's artifacts.
Sorrows, festivals, feasts, games, contests
of its custom and practices reminded you.
With its callipers I saw the world 
to draw present and future schemes.
Wherever of earth found, Hellada I met.
I loved voyages distant.
Even if that bitterness flares up
that old untravelled dander of mine
with our Things' indecencies
patience is now shown, 
hoping sometime to start
again our hands to handle
cooly and deftly
the instruments euclidean. 


Whether they have forgotten
Or are forgetting now
Or never remembered - 
Safer not to know - 

Miseries of conjecture
Are a softer woe
Than a Fact of Iron
Hardened with I know 


-Ghost expanse
You are nothing but there! 
Search parties set out
	and are gone.
Shadows make journeys across you; 
Gloomy patches grow and merge
Until looking up we see
	the fishbelly streak of dawn! 


Above dark bushes a balustrade
For giddy socialites to lean upon; 
An all-night diner where pop-veined faces
Show shockingly against the tile walls.


I want to hear many stereos in concert
Outside a dorm on a spring night:  preserve me from silence.

I want to see the looks on fifty faces
Passing my bench as if in promenade:  spare me the darkness.


Brahman of colors
Be-all and end-all of hues
To which each vagrant mauve and taupe return, 
Toward you we send wafting
An offertory scent of linseed oil
Forgive us our splotches. 


To be fit for display on the Tree of Knowledge 
A fruit's skin must rouse you, yet signal danger
A certain jungle fruit would never make the grade
More enticing to monkeys than to temptresses
A handle to be grabbed and held while eaten
An ingratiating scent, a slippery smooth heart
Simulacrum of cream that doesn't cloy the guts
Shaped to fit the mouth, made to be stripped
Of the clown suit it dyed to ape the sun's aura
While a Greek fruit in the same sun-struck hue
Shouts its pride that it grew directly exposed 
As it shimmers inside and teems with radiance 
Changed to a smell that assaults the nose brightly
Elsewhere certain lawn and woodland flowers 
With milky sap managing to keep their stems erect
Raise bright crowns to smile back at the sun
And surprise children when held beneath the chin
A trick to reveal something rich and fine within

Man has as much urge to leave his footprints
As he has to leave his child in the world.
It is his urge to make something about him
That disturbs the balance of the world.




As my letter must be brief, 
I'll at once state my belief,
And this it is -- that, since the world began,
And Adam first did say,
"'Twas Eve led me astray,"
A woman hath more patience than a man. 

If a man's obliged to wait
For some one who's rather late,
No mortal ever got in such a stew,
And if something can't be found
That he's sure should be around,
The listening air sometimes grows fairly blue.

Just watch a man who tries
To soothe a baby's cries;
Or put a stove pipe up in weather cold,
Into what a state he'll get;
How he'll fuss and fume and fret
And stamp and bluster round and storm and scold!

Some point to Job with pride,
As an argument for their side!
Why, it was so rare a patient man to see,
That when one was really found,
His discoverers were bound
To preserve for him a place in history!

And while I admit it's true
That man has some patience too,
And that woman isn't always sweetly calm,
Still I think all must agree
On this central fact -- that she
For central all-round patience bears the palm.


Now in confusion I am in market, 
Many brands are available are new, 
Oil I take usually is not available, 
Which oil I shall take for cooking? 

I have asked my son, he has clarified, 
For getting nutrients daily perfectly, 
We shall take varieties in exchanging, 
Taking oil through food is necessary.

Sunflower oil is energy booster we see, 
Anti-inflammatory properties this has, 
Heart health is improved with immunity, 
This balances cholesterol in body also.

Mustard oil relaxes and rejuvenates, 
Improving skin this treats gum diseases, 
This acts as pain balm and this shines, 
This protects from Bactria and Fungus. 

Olive oil holds monounsaturated fats, 
This contains antioxidants and vitamins, 
Preventing strokes and heart diseases, 
This has strong anti-inflammatory values. 

Son says to bring all types of oils sure, 
In kitchen time to time we should change, 
For good health and happy lucky living, 
Taking different types of oils is good. 

i felt you touch my heart
again deeper than you think
if your word is whole cake
i will slice it so thin
barely floating on my tongue
then i close my lips gently

i will close my eyes, dream
of you with your sweet smile
longing for a long soft kiss
i can feel your finger nails
rising along my ribs, very sharp
it tickles to slight pain, cruel


While the west is paling
Starshine is begun.
While the dusk is failing
Glimmers up the sun.

So, till darkness cover
Life's retreating gleam,
Lover follows lover,
Dream succeeds to dream.

Stoop to my endeavour,
O my love, and be
Only and for ever
Sun and stars to me. 


I watch you as you sleep, 
Feel a warming breeze pass your cold, still lips; 
An essence of florals, and my eyes affix, 
On the bleeding heart draped upon your silk, blue gown.

A string of pearl rosaries intertwine alabaster fingers; 
The Crucifix looks down on you with venerating passion; 
A single ivory rose finds peace beside your breast; 
Reminds me of the one you pressed in that paperback of Poe.

And, oh, those abhorrent catty-cornered torchere lamps, 
Juxtaposed and rigid as Buckingham Guards.
You used to say ''Why must parlors insist on their presence? '' 
I despise them too, and for you my love, I command their removal.

'Tis nine at night, prayers of closure fade to eerie silence; 
I exercise temperence with amorphous expression; 
Masking wired nerves,  depressed veins in migrain; 
Handshakes of pestilence acknowledge unknown faces.

Woke up this morning to the sound of rain, our final day will cry.
Alone now, kneeling before you; so many thoughts, so little time; 
Instead, I kiss your powdered cheek, and whisper in your ear: 
''l await the day i'll place an ivory rose on you, again''. 


After many years of experimentation
I have found no reliable method for 
imparting magic to my words.
Just like you, however
every once in a while
and in spite of myself
the magic just happens. 

As I write
the poems
I would seed drop
the clouds
with them
so they would
fall to earth
as rainbow hued
sun showers. 


Between the departing day and the descending night
      If it suddenly rains as a bolt from the blue
      With no umbrella to shield our heads
How I wish to walk with you
My hands twined around your waist
And no one around but only you and me

As the sun hides behind the Western gats
Bleeding red and waxing pale
How I wish to ramble hand in hand
      Along the sea shore under the canopy of the sky
Sharing silent thoughts and counting the waves
Lost in our private world, just you and me

On a clear day when the Southern Bay 
Like a voluptuous maid lies draped in blue
And its placid surface dotted with sailing boats	
How I wish to get into one 
And drift afar to some unknown destination
With no one else but you and me

On a silent morn, standing on a rocky precipice
How I wish to proclaim aloud to a world, 
Slowly emerging from the haze of mist
That you are mine and mine only 
And to its rebounding echo, a spectral form from far 
Responding- ‘We are one, you and me'

Somewhere in a sheltered nook, 
Screened from the buzzing crowd, a river winding by
With clear waters snoozing on the white sand
In a small sequestered cottage, 
Where nightly winds flute on the window panes
How I wish to build a life with just you and me

As we stand in a tight warm embrace
When my hot breath falls on the nape of your neck
And as you pant with passion like a frightened deer
How I wish to get enrobed in your mystery
And sail down to the abyss of an unknown experience
When nobody else matters, but only you and me! 
----------------------

When life takes an obliterating course, 
When suddenly the night closes over
And dangers prowl around us like carnivores beasts, 
How I wish we could still remain one in spirit and soul
And the vagrant fate or the wanton death
Could never separate us, you and me

Windowpanes and shattering shades of curtain 
Dancing in tune with blowing winds 
Tingles of doorbells, a misnomer 
No more waiting, some one is there 
Shivering lips, hardly a whisper 
Yet, to recover, lonesome but muddled with 
Fragrance of lost smile and 
Rhythm of chuckling, 
And woman at poolside 
Gaze to glare with raze 
Ravish and relinquish, water marks in your eyes   
And the ability to explore dreams in my eyes 
Don’t swallow the big burgeoning blushes 
Trackers do carry milestones 
Do count lamppost of dusk and hammer strokes needed 
Rigmarole, you may say, 

Scrap to scintillate a new odor, to epitomize a new fragrance 
Roses all the way, cozy to deal with hallucinating elegance 
We walk across, scrawling memoirs, crumbling prejudices 
Legs moving in harmony, you in my arms, your head lying and tumbling over my shoulders, 
My whistling lips, and your half open- half closed eyes 
Under whimsical surroundings, 
Curvy moon trying to peep in from clouds, 
Trees trying to usher in to growing bounds, 
Clones and pulsating sounds of rose teasing 
Lull ness, but music in thoughts and clutching, 
My hands, you cynosure of my feelings, 
Closed eyeballs and your shivering lips, 
Sky falling over beloved lush-green land 
Shrinking horizon in my eyes, 
Sequencing through dreamy experience, 
Winds to mould and to feel ecstasy of changing realms 

 

for little less than free, 
crack the whip, my skin is bare to thee, 
Crimson drips from the gashes upon my back, 
Losing sight. .. 

vision is what I lack.
Fall asleep upon this Crimson drenched earth, 
Forever to sleep, lets see what my soul is worth.
Harder she continues, 
I fall to the ground, 
Im at a loss for words, I cannot mumble a sound, 
Pain consumes my insides, 
Crawling within me, 
I feel her presence, 
harder she whips me, 
pain embellished upon my body, 
Not only my body drips crimson, 
so do that of my bleeding words. 

I am maddened by the
Death-knock.
In a frenzy I run, 
for the many chores to be done. 
From the stillness of mountains and lakes
to hear ancient songs, 
to unravel mysteries of tales from the past, 
of trees to enquire after
the business of growth, 
to watch the ever-changing
shapes of clouds, 
through sweet-voiced, goodly birds
seek the source of divine fruits, 
touch flowers of a blushing creeper, 
make conversation
with doorways and walls.
So many visitors still wait; 
a long list of unseen vistas
beheld in the eyes, pounds
in the veins, 
exploding them any moment, 
but I am busy, 
in a flurry to carry out the chores. 
The ocean calls, 
islands and coastlines
for aeons have longed for me.
They haunt me, the fishermen
singing songs as they return
to their abodes; 
some day I'll pay them a visit. 
Enchanting lands
restively wait
to reveal their many treasures; 
paths are not unknown to me, 
in the old wooden trunk, lie safe
the maps; 
I can also discern the melody of gods, 
but I am busy. 
So much to be done for the children.
Books and notebooks, 
school uniforms, new bags, 
toys, bats and rackets
and so much more that is
yet unsaid, 
will make them happy
if I buy for them, 
but I am busy, 
have to see through so many chores. 
Faster now, blood rushes
through the veins; 
life is possessed by the frenzy of Death.
Busy I am, 
hurriedly scribbling poem after poem, 
maddened by the Death-knock.


Who are you? 
I am the whirlwind 
which stirs on this earth, 
my eyes keep watching
for solitude and calm, 
I see love and freedom
walking parallel to life, 
as teenagers romance
everywhere, anytime
without any restrictions.
I see rules standing on the sidewalk
while reality gets entangled
in the firework of admittance
as lovers seek compatibility 
in each other's harmony; 
while mothers and fathers  
grant liberty silently 
to their grown-up children
to live independently. 
They as parents  themselves
have to re-build their lives
re-structure their minds, 
their strength, 
when sons and daughters leave home
in search of prospects and posterity.
And, as age permits youth 
to sing and dance, drink and dream
suddenly manhood, womanhood appears
and changes the color of their illusions.
No stealer of hearts
no thieves of money
no robbers of propositions
in that game of love; 
so, none condemned, none punished 
as lovers willingly offer compliance
and reciprocation of feelings 
in anticipation of companionship
and continuity of togetherness.
Love, a relationship, an union 
that rolls  minds,  hearts
thro' the marketplaces of compatibility
as one bargains with another
for wishful thinking to be realities.
I am the whirlwind watching 
life raving, love accelerating, 
until finally, in the anti-climax of time, 
old age dis-integrates
men and his accomplishments
into a box of dust.
In that short span of life
spent on  earth, none realize 
the whirlwind is their own heart
which is impulsive, meteoric 
in its velocity, its intensity, 
it travels  thro' fears and tears
thro'  mysteries and redemption
to connect to another heart  
with all its fury, with all its desire, 
spinning and swirling vertically
to reach to the centre of passion
and in that landfall of time
it reaps thro' the devastation
his own heart has created
by that whirlwind called love. 


Whisky poet! After eating a cold supper, 
the crowd Pat used to associate with 
when she was still at high school 
no longer want to hear you read your poems — it’s after 
eleven o’clock on a hot December evening, and you 
are a little sore-head. Yet from Vegas 
I finally came to your rescue. 
         I hadn’t slept long when I 
awoke, a few miles under the table, sinking 
slowly into everything had come down 
with a faint crash. I’d make up my 
mind later, I thought, should there prove 
to be a reason to do so. Meanwhile I had plans 
to get laid, as in plots to hatch, so I bestirred 
myself from the futile picnic and rang 
to be continued. Mr Penny, who lived in 
my pocket, had a chute I used to slide down 
while fishing for odd jobs: wherever it led to 
told me what I wanted. I didn’t want 
whisky, but I did want the whisky poet 
to read me one of his poems. I’d step 
to the edge of the precipice and signal. Sometimes 
I’d see Pat and her school friends signalling back 
to thank me — clearly they thought I too was
untanked — as I entered the back of the ambulance 
and the whisky poet began declaiming, and his name 
went up in lights, and I blanked out 
as we left the kerb. 


All alone
(I’ve been betrayed) 
Wrapped in fear
(Shouldn’t have stayed) 
Blinding tears
(How I have paid) 
Love is gone
(I have been played) 
Shattered heart
(Lost in this raid) 
Many things
(I had not weighed) 
Distant life
(Will not be made) 
Far untouched
(Dead as a shade) 
Crumpled down
(Stay where I laid) 
Given up
(I’ll make this trade) 
Life is lost
(It will be stayed) 
Dripping blood
(I bless this blade)


Passing through stages of life
We have reached in to new phase
Age of faith to age of illusion
We only witness and forget soon.

But coming age does whisper here
Be attentive and hear its sound
This calls to learn and train
Values in life draw beauty love.

Wonderful whisper is done to build
Paradise we shall see again, again
Father comes to teach secrets more
We are followers of his kingdom.

Now let us sing his songs of truth
Only he can take us in lovely path
Eternal bliss we need we need peace

When Love I bestow, it shall be upon thee, 
My love like my life are yours, can't you see? 
Your love more valuable than anything to me, 
Your beautiful smile, 
Your heart warming touch, 
Your simple words, I love so much.


You can say nothing, and I can still hear you, 
your heart whispering, telling me of its love, 
It tells me its mine, forever and always, 
carressing such beauty, I should count myself lucky, 
Beauty can decieve but within you no lies I see.


Beauty unsurpassed, that is you, 
so sweet, my sweet tooth cannot resist, 
Your love so divine, This calls for intervention, 
I'm becoming weaker, I've let you in, 
You shall remain in my heart, 
To this day. . forever.
Even upon entering death, 
our love shall remain. 


Snowfall, snowfall. 
With  white  roses. 

Snowfall,  snowfall. 
 With white  dreams. 

 Snowfall,  snowfall.  
The angel has arrived. 
 
Snowfall,  snowfall.  
With white wings.  

Snowfall.  snowfall 
 silent song was  bringing

  Snowfall,  snowfall.  
Silently he  began to sing.  

Whispered sweetly he.  

Snowfall, snowfall
 White- roses falls on  me. 



I whisper softly in the direction that is yours, 
will you listen? 
would you be able to hear? 
whispers so faint their hardly there, 
left to the mute, they speak of the deaf, in whispers, 
tell me mute friends, 
and listen then follow, 


This unseen, and unheard whisper shall within, reside and wallow. 


Whispers from a shadow
follow me through the street
shades of light from the moon's glow
follow my wiery feet
whispers from all around
quiet voices without a sound
footsteps following me 
from people my eyes cannot see

Wherever i go
voices i do not know
wherever i go
whispers from a shadow

Whispers from a dark place
invade my open mind
from strangers with no face
deaf, mute and blind
whispers from far and near
filling my listening ears
glaring eyes following me
from the branches of broken trees

Wherever i go
voices i do not know
wherever i go
whispers from a shadow

whispers from the shade of night
swallowed into my brain
whispers from the left and right
whispers from the sidewalk drain
wherever i go
voices i do not know
wherever i go
i hear whispers
Whispers from a shadow

In dreams I see
those stars 
laid bare for me
deserts large 
and ocean drops
universes in my eyes
even though succinct, 
when thou playest god to me

Remake me again
See thou my  puerile heart of gold
Sculpt me as thy will
With hands 
like  Michaelangelo's
Paint me 
with myriad hues 
of the rainbow

The ecstasy I want
honey or nectar
your oblation, 
like rivulets of Eden
flow from thy heart
the musky fragrance of love
so divine so pure
lingers on and on
never to evanesce.

Dost thou remember
those looks, 
a longing of a mute child.
Those gifts 
when hastily snatched, 
as diamonds 
from the caverns of the mines, 
so were the tears from my eyes
that fell to become the stars
in that distant sky, 
when playing hide ad seek
in the game of solitary love

Hush I hear
thy many whispers in my ears
And blush
i feel, the feel of those fingers
the silken strands of my hairs.
hide my face on thy bust will I
That moments desire so seraphic
I canst never forget that my love





the whispers still tangle the web in hide
across the green of  the deep cornfield
waking the upkeep by the voices over the years 
jingling tone on the rungs of awful grin yet heard

night when dying deep by the rain of silence
wordless words of innocence never be despised
Pretext of love yet reasons all the blue entwined
hiding all the clouds averred from the purple plume

Oh it is dazzling here again in long night
I come away in a heartbeat
thought ingenious flows onto the yonder pane

like rain water into the memoirs of the night
the moist darkness over the green leaves
the rain drops sleeks away from the leaf tip
yet it bestirs the clenching hand to bow down 


the green meadow smooches with the wet shadow
I still remember the gone bye days hanging over swing
sky when blazes the glory of rain by the songs from core
the gleams of love overshadow the morn intoned



Whistle from
Chasm of Nova
Illuminates cute cova.

Carmine call from
Earth's magma  
They're arche mamma
For Aurevoir 
Our dwelling decor.
 
Don't refute
Rebut confute mute.

Though rapturously mystic 
Yet magnanimously majestic!   




. 

when my father had been dead a week
I woke
with his voice in my ear 
                         I sat up in bed

and held my breath
and stared at the pale closed door

white apples and the taste of stone

if he called again
I would put on my coat and galoshes


On a white blank paper
I'm writing the chronicle of a tormented soul
Reality and dream are two different things
Can't achieve the same goal

On a white blank paper 
I'm putting the pieces of my broken heart
Vanquished & overpowered by the joy of sorrow
Relinquish to the power of thought of a new start

This white blank paper
Witnessing the commotion of another love story
Love brings tears love creates pain
But only painful love gets the imperial glory


White clouds 
Morphing wonderfully 
Watch those bears 
Changing into 
Rows of elephants 
Shaping like 
A frail old man standing 
Rearranging into children 
Playing with balloons. 

White clouds 
Sway on cradle of the wind 
Occasionally shrivel 
With toil and sadness 
At times inflate 
With joy and gladness 
Never forget 
Heaven nor earth 
They lie pendent 
Between the two worlds. 

White clouds 
Strolling since eternity 
Telling strange fables 
Of grand olden dwellings 
With a world of ancient souls 
When there was nothing, but 
A fluid of light, 
A landscape of mist 
And a suspended caravan 
Of several ages. 

White clouds, now 
Moulding into sombre faces, become 
Storms sulking on the horizon. 
Thousands of maladies thrive 
Above and underneath the land. 
White clouds 
Course through hearts, 
Surging in 


By a white witch,
Wid white magic
An white lies,
Branded by a white sheep
I slaved as a whitesmith
Near a white spot
Where I suffered whitewater fever.
Whitelisted as a whiteleg
I waz in de white book
As a master of white art,
It waz like white death. 

People called me white jack
Some hailed me as a white wog,
So I joined de white watch
Trained as a white guard
Lived off the white economy.
Caught and beaten by de whiteshirts
I waz condemned to a white mass,
Don't worry,


I shall be writing to de Black House. 

The beauty and stillness of untamed country side
Emitting crowd and noise instead of concrete mountains
And the tall trees reaching skies attracts everybody
The joy and silence of a white dove easily spilled. 

moon in the night 
illumines silvery light 
and looks on the earth; 
finds the fallen stars 
stuck on the white flower trees


What lifts the heron leaning on the air 
I praise without a name. A crouch, a flare, 
a long stroke through the cumulus of trees, 
a shaped thought at the sky - then gone. O rare! 
Saint Francis, being happiest on his knees, 
would have cried Father! Cry anything you please	

But praise. By any name or none. But praise 
the white original burst that lights 
the heron on his two soft kissing kites. 
When saints praise heaven lit by doves and rays, 
I sit by pond scums till the air recites 
It's heron back. And doubt all else. But praise. 



Where run your colts at pasture?
  Where hide your mares to breed?
'Mid bergs about the Ice-cap
  Or wove Sargasso weed;
By chartless reef and channel,
  Or crafty coastwise bars,
But most the ocean-meadows
  All purple to the stars!

Who holds the rein upon you?
  The latest gale let free.
What meat is in your mangers?
  The glut of all the sea.
'Twixt tide and tide's returning
  Great store of newly dead, --
The bones of those that faced us,
  And the hearts of those that fled.
Afar, off-shore and single,
  Some stallion, rearing swift,
Neighs hungry for new fodder,
  And calls us to the drift:
Then down the cloven ridges --
  A million hooves unshod --
Break forth the mad White Horses

Girth-deep in hissing water
  Our furious vanguard strains --
Through mist of mighty tramplings
  Roll up the fore-blown manes --
A hundred leagues to leeward,
  Ere yet the deep is stirred,
The groaning rollers carry
  The coming of the herd!

Whose hand may grip your nostrils --
  Your forelock who may hold?
E'en they that use the broads with us --
  The riders bred and bold,
That spy upon our matings,
  That rope us where we run --
They know the strong White Horses
  From father unto son.

We breathe about their cradles,
  We race their babes ashore,
We snuff against their thresholds,
  We nuzzle at their door;
By day with stamping squadrons,
  By night in whinnying droves,
Creep up the wise White Horses,
  To call them from their loves.

And come they for your calling?
  No wit of man may save.
They hear the loosed White Horses
  Above their fathers' grave;
And, kin of those we crippled,
  And, sons of those we slew,
Spur down the wild white riders
  To school the herds anew.

What service have ye paid them,
  Oh jealous steeds and strong?
Save we that throw their weaklings,
  Is none dare work them wrong;
While thick around the homestead
  Our snow-backed leaders graze --
A guard behind their plunder,
  And a veil before their ways.

With march and countermarchings --
  With weight of wheeling hosts --
Stray mob or bands embattled --
  We ring the chosen coasts:
And, careless of our clamour
  That bids the stranger fly,
At peace with our pickets
  The wild white riders lie.

	.	.	.	.

Trust ye that curdled hollows --
  Trust ye the neighing wind --
Trust ye the moaning groundswell --
  Our herds are close behind!
To bray your foeman's armies --
  To chill and snap his sword --
Trust ye the wild White Horses,

I was pushing the laden trolley

when I saw him - flying low
with long outstretched wings
and something blue
like a parachute
trailing behind.


A white ibis! 

He dropped out of the air
close to me
and staggered
drunkenly
into the Safeway loading bay.

I crawled after him on hands and knees.

He was utterly helpless
helpless and ridiculous
wearing that silly plastic bag
like a necklace.


A moment of hesitation
- as I perused the long curved bill -
then I lunged quickly
and held the bird tight
(Mum used to keep chooks)     

His trembling body felt warm
and fragile beneath my hands
and his beak wasn't sharp at all -
but rubbery when he pecked me.
It didn't hurt a bit.


I removed the bag
and the bird flew away
leaving me strangely elated. 

Many of us have seen from far, 
White leaves fall from tree star.
Who watches with full of care? 
Few plan  not to be in the stare.

Ripen fruits, dried leaves they see, 
Wet flower cries too comes bee, 
Decorating in minds of many fly, 
Flower leaving fragrance does dry.

Modern time people plan do think, 
Behind matter run, in pleasure sink.
Link their minds to money more, 
They forget how to cross life's shore.

Service to parents forget children, 
In happiness they do sorrow rain.
Pain many feel pleasure to dry up, 
Some plan to drink shiny star cup.


Wonder, wonder is affection to dust, 
White leaves can be green in top tower.


Nor lit the candles, 
You don't know, don't care, 
That tired I haven't the strength 
To decide to go to bed. 
Seeing the fields fade in 
The sunset murk of pine-needles, 
And to know all is lost, 

That life is a cursed hell: 
I've got drunk 
On your voice in the doorway. 
I was sure you'd come back. 

Wrapped in reflective pleochroic
white paper with etched horse heads.
Stone bridge covered in the
center by the black soot of
thousands of trains.

Over ripened watermelon
heated in the mid-day sun
until it bursts open its viscus
red innards.

Footsteps into a lonely forest
path as dusk darkens the
shadows of twisted branches.
and you.



Teenagers of Chang’an pitied spring late, too
Rushed to the fore to know the purple peony in Cien Temple
There was another like a jade plate bearing the weight of cold dews
But nobody got up to see it in the light of moon





White poplar flowers
When the wind blew they crossed the river
Let the palace trees lose colors
Waved sights and sounds of spring thousands of miles
It’s a long autumn under the vast sun at the dawn
Sorrow song continued and the crows flew up from the city walls


In the middle of nowhere
On the new national highway
Transfixed I stood
With a broken down car
An April sun fumed above

I had just passed a board
Which named the place White Rock
There wasn’t anything white around
Just a small village of scattered huts
Looming black granite hills
Surrounded by desultory woods

Perhaps a pearly rock hill white 
Had stood there before
An extreme singularity
And unwillingly given way
To the tapering highway
A geological marvel
A prehistoric volcanic spit 
Or a meteor that landed with a fiery thud

No one knows
And in moonlit nights
It might have resembled from above
A domed UFO hidden in the woods
Lovers of the village had sat on it
Shared their sweet aches in tight embrace

Or in the morning sun
Cobras had mated at its foot
Their moist mouths in rainbow hue
Hooded bodies coiled like vine
In sublime dance of ecstasy

It has vanished without a trace
A keyhole to prehistoric past
The Sun sprang illusory pools
On the unending asphalt tape
That fumed and ran further down
Into an unknown future
Sans any link to the past

White Sheep Wine

You're the one who saw us as two white starlings
in that weaving with two white birds in it 
we brought back from Crete and hung 
behind our bed. In your myth of white starlings 
I walk around to your solid white back 
and stretch over your thrashing tail feathers
to kiss your beak from behind you, 
kiss the scarlet beak 
of your white starling.  

In my myth I saw the two of us 
as a button and a half.  Sometimes 
I was the button, sometimes the half.
A couple times you were the half. 
Once in a while both buttons 
were whole, but unmatched. 
I spent more time than you
as the half. You said I even 
looked like the half.  

Hell with all that. I ride 
a white starling down to the shore, 
I live in your myth in a house between 
sea rocks buffed by the grind 
of white surf. Raised on a hem 
of the sand, clasped from behind 
by my wing― a white starling rides you.


Your myth is better. 

Listen sweet Dove unto my song, 
And spread thy golden wings in me; 
Hatching my tender heart so long, 
Till it get wing, and fly away with thee.

Where is that fire which once descended
On thy Apostles? thou didst then
Keep open house, richly attended, 
Feasting all comers by twelve chosen men.

Such glorious gifts thou didst bestow, 
That th'earth did like a heav'n appear; 
The stars were coming down to know
If they might mend their wages, and serve here.


The sun which once did shine alone, 
Hung down his head, and wisht for night, 
When he beheld twelve suns for one
Going about the world, and giving light.

But since those pipes of gold, which brought
That cordial water to our ground, 
Were cut and martyr'd by the fault 
Of those, who did themselves through their side wound, 

Thou shutt'st the door, and keep'st within; 
Scarce a good joy creeps through the chink: 
And if the braves of conqu'ring sin
Did not excite thee, we should wholly sink.

Restore this day, for thy great name, 
Unto his ancient and miraculous right.


Who Am I


All of the words I want to say
Some other poet has said 
In such a stupendously marvelous way
That they just cry out to be read.
So many beautiful poems
Express what I want to express; 
For me to say it again
Would be mere presumptuousness.
My words would be a regression
In the light of their thorough address, 
Yet my thoughts cry out for expression; 
I'll just have to say them I guess
And hope that beside the great masters
My efforts will not be in vain, 
And somewhere in the ages hereafter
Someone will read them again
And see the need through my prism
And somehow recognize why
Those words were torn from the bosom
Of one so unworthy as I. 

I am me, a walking talking living human
I, caged in my brain myself in command 
Always thinking carried by my train of thoughts, 
Stopping at stations of life rebounding with kindness
 Aggression laughter and sadness in life’s situations.
Expelling feelings of all kinds, I one of
Billions on earth each with their own
Concerns naturally for their own family, 
Concern for a happy life to be born free.
I expel my thoughts that we all should
Live in the kingdom of freedom.
I am me, I am free, not so for many 
In this world with human conflict.
Love fills my heart, love is the start
For a world of the free, yes, 
For you and I, thru the eye of wisdom.
Unification of giving by everyone to feed 
The starving of the world, 
Who am I, I am one who wants to sell the wisdom
Of kindness for the poor without food without dignity, 
It all just makes sense for us all to give.


‘What a piece of work is a man! '
---           ---
And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? '

From Shakespeare, through Hamlet
It rings down to generations
And falls heavily on my ears too
 
In vain, I attempt to probe into the mystery
Nay, the enigma called man
Both in the silence of my solitude 
And in the learned circle of pundits

(Fool
.
Unable to find who you are
Can you venture to say who the other man is?)   

Man, a jumble of contradictions, 
I know


A hard nut to crack! 
So unfathomable, so mysterious
At once a Satan and an angel


To the outer world I am someone
But in the well guarded cellars of my privacy
Aren't I different? 
Hiding my innards to light
As every other man

At times, I feel so proud 
Excessively in love with my own image
Like Narcissus, the poor hunter boy
Fated by gods to languish 
On the bank of a pond, 
Over his own floating image! 

However with all my strength within
Do I not feel as helpless as Prometheus bound? 
Waiting for a Hercules to come
And save me from my plight
Mine is self willed-! 

Is the difference so very crucial? 

Sometimes I feel I am Janus
Looking backward and forward
Into my past and my future
Never living in the present	
Or am I more a Sisyphus
Eternally rolling a rock over to the cliff
From where it keeps falling down

Sometimes I wonder
Amid the splendour, do I not starve? 
Like Tantalus of Greece in the pool
Beneath the tree, with the low lying branches of fruits
Constantly eluding his grasp
And the water, ever receding before
He could take a drink! 

As a poet how I wish I could
Equate myself with Calliope
Carving my mind on the wax tablet
With stylus, my pen and coloring it with my fancy
Or Orpheus, so skilled in music
That with my sad musings
I can make even Hades weep
And the rocks fall in line


I shudder to be a Medusa
Turning everyone to a stone
With my sinister glance! 
Instead, I want to be one of the Graces
And never one among the Gorgons

Pitched in this gallery
Of queer mythological entities
I wonder how I appear to others
And whom I resemble more



Who am I
I don't know
I know what I am, 
what labels others apply to me

 I am human
or so they say
But tell me something
what is so humane about our species
something found in no others, something humane

I am a lesbian
Yes, a lover of women
but I now choose very selectively
though weary of trust, I am starved for love

 I am a crone
Old, and withered by life
I feel so aged, and weary at times
I am sickened by what I see that others do not 
Even though I seldom see what is right in front of me

I am a child
I look about myself in wonder
society constantly baffles my mind
I find happiness in the small things of life
I have experienced so little, but seen so much
I still believe in love, so naive in matters of the heart

I am an author
I write many stories
of loving, living, understanding
though I do not yet understand these things

I am a poet
at least that is what i am told
My pen hardly touches the paper
and I think of what's important, in my heart
My feelings flow freely in verse and sometimes not

 I am a pacifist
I abhor anger, and violence
it destroys love, lives, and souls
I think there is always a peaceful solution
if one is willing to search their heart and soul
Though it may be harder,  let go of your pride and try

I am a survivor
Many battles I have faced
Somehow I always come out of them
but never whole, for it is not that simple
Along the way I have had to make sacrifices
but here I stand, in quiet defiance and always will 
Though I am tattered, battered, and occasionally shattered

 Who am I
I think above all
I am an individual


Who can joyfully dance and sing
When the bells of death do ring

Who can stand and stare
 When daggers are drawn to tear

Who can slumber in peace
When danger at the door step waits to seize

Who can reel upon the toe
When waves do roar and winds do blow

Who can hide a tear
When the heart with sorrow smear

 Who can plough the field
When the crops never give any yield

Who can sing a tune
If the sun has set at noon

Who can tend the flock
If there is no wool to cloak

Who can feast on the beauty around
when the sad note of a dirge rings aloud

Who can continue to smile
At someone so full of vile

Who can pour out songs in rhyme
When all your dreams are burnt in time

Who can feel delighted and glad
In a cage, though its bars be made of gold

Who can stick to truth
When Death threatens you like a brute

If you can’t, you are a man
If otherwise, you are a superman



How I wander who could walk with me in the white sand.
In the afternoon, watching a lovely sunset ‘til the twilight, 
I wander who could be with me at the evening dark.
In front of the bonfire with the cold breeze of night; 

I wander who could be with me sitting in the dark and stars.
Staring the sky wishing all stars be fortunately mine.
That willing to shares and accepts my craziness and loneliness; 
Take heart my happiness as well, until the morning shines.

Could find me when I’m nowhere and out of place; 
Could tell my innermost feelings, stories and memories; 
Who could dance with me through the rain and sun? 

I wander who could be with every time I’m alone.
Who could understand me as I am with my weaknesses? 
And could notice my existence even I’m just a tiny one.
Who could dares to teach me to be strong when I’m down.

How I wander who could held my hand to fight and strive.
When times come off, I fail to reach my ardent dreams.
Who let me stands still if I lost my courage once.
Who could be with me through everything was gone


So who could benefit in what I will write? 
Does common good remain insight? 
What is good to the evil? 
What is happy to the sad? 
Can't everyone be pleased by the same thing? 
Good is good happy is happy, 
If someone frowns, you broke their rules, 
If they never smile they are fools, 
Who are they, anger trippers.? 
They trip on anger.
So trip on good and pleasantness. 

Pray, why does it rain
On Independence Day? Hey-
Freedom fighters cry-


The love of a woman is killing me. 
My heart is inflamed, it is craving. 
poisoned by a potion of sweet love, 
and blinded by sweet lips & kisses, 
who dare to save me? 


I’m entraped in a cave, deep under, 
Entangle in webs of sweet influence
Of love which lay snares & beams.
I Baffled love, I do not comprehend, 
rustling in its memories & mysteries.. 

My heart rises for the unknown.
Something deepen then the ocean
And as Stronger as first love, that
caged my mind in the wilderness, 
Cloud me with doubts day & night. 

How I wish to undo these spells
Unlock my heart from these bondages.
And how strong, these radiance of love, 
And how mighty those glorous eyes.
Who dare to save me


Who does he Love

Oh, how I heard him cry
deep into the night
singing his lullabies
to the midnight wind, 
among the billions of stars 
that shines from far
twinkling like little flashes 
of candlelight, 
But just then I heard him
calling out my name! 
Saying, please remember me
In all my dreams; 
Come back to me, 
I would hear him cry another time, 
then I started remembering his voice
But from where? 
before long it was time to wake up, 
that's when I see him looking back at me.





I asked the Zebra:

Are you black with white stripes?
Or white with black stripes?

And the zebra asked me:

Are you good with bad habits?
Or are you bad with good habits?
Are you noisy with quiet times?
Or are you quiet with noisy times?
Are you happy with some sad days?
Or are you sad with some happy days?
Are you neat with some sloppy ways?
Or are you sloppy with some neat ways?

And on and on and on and on
And on and on he went.

I’ll never ask a zebra

About stripes

Again


It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is overruled by fate.
When two are stripped, long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should love, the other win;

And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
The reason no man knows; let it suffice
What we behold is censured by our eyes.
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever loved, that loved not at first sight


WHO will go drive with Fergus now,
And pierce the deep wood's woven shade,
And dance upon the level shore?
Young man, lift up your russet brow,
And lift your tender eyelids, maid,
And brood on hopes and fear no more.
And no more turn aside and brood
Upon love's bitter mystery;
For Fergus rules the brazen cars,
And rules the shadows of the wood,
And the white breast of the dim sea
And all dishevelled wandering stars. 

Who has seen the wind?
Neither I nor you.
But when the leaves hang trembling,
The wind is passing through.
Who has seen the wind?
Neither you nor I.
But when the trees bow down their heads,
The wind is passing by. 

As violets so be I recluse and sweet, 
Cheerful as daisies unaccounted rare, 
Still sunward-gazing from a lowly seat, 
Still sweetening wintry air. 


While half-awakened Spring lags incomplete, 
While lofty forest trees tower bleak and bare, 
Daisies and violets own remotest heat 
And bloom and make them fair. 

Who I am is a girl who cries.
Who never seems to be happy
with whom I am.

Who I am is a girl that is beaten.
Not physically, but emotionally.
Whatever I do, it’s not good enough.
Self esteem down so far, for anyone
to bring it up.

Who I am is a nice girl.
To nice for anyone to take seriously.
To nice to stand up for myself
when others bring me down.

Who I am is a girl in pain.
Always being put down by family
and friends.
Nobody appreciates anymore what 
People do. 
Being laughed at, made fun of
just because you were a little different.
Not what the popular girls were like, 
or everyone else, so you had to suffer.

 
Who I am is a girl who is laid back.
Like an ocean on a bright sunny day.
as it looks so peaceful, 
and you just want to look at it all day.

Who I am is a girl who fights
in what I believe in.
Never down for the count.
Always there by your side. 

Who I am is someone you can trust.
I will never give up on you, 
and I will never lose faith in you. 




Who in a Million Loves Me? 
Heavens above, my friend do you really need to ask? 
Or for just a moment even think you are alone, Well do you? Do you? 

In moments dark and dismal view love as a Mammalian Drive.
Not much better than  a nagging hunger or an un-quenchable  thirst.

Attraction being plain just as the nose upon your face.

Mating epilogue to Lust but we have no need to even venture there.
In Love there comes a time in Life beyond  the three overlapping stages, 
Lust turning to attraction and glory be Attachment, hopefully for Life.
Love and Attachment is the marital bonding that promotes relationships.
In Love the Brain will constantly release the chemicals  essentially required, 
Only then my, Friend will you understand, who in a million loves you.
Next time that question comes to your brain, rush to the mirror I pray.

Look in the reflection and say to yourself, I love you, I love you, I do! 
Virtues you gather in all of Life Paths will serve your irresistible urge.
Ennobled with self love, and the Father the Son and Holy Mother and all.
Seek no longer who in a million Loves Me. Who needs my Love? Is the course.

Make way in the world  convey Love endlessly, to every one that you chance to meet.



A friend is someone
To call upon
During times—
Good and bad.

A friend is someone
Who understands
What you need.

A friend is someone 
Who knows
What you are going through
At all times.

A friend is someone 
Who is happy for you—
When things go well.

A friend is someone 
Who tries to
Cheer you up
When you are feeling blue.

A friend is someone 
Without whom
You are incomplete.

A friend is –
An extension of your self.


Remember who we are
We are the dead men
With black horizontal breath
Rolling on life in pressures of crime.

Remember who we are
We are the murderers
With weight of cultural deaths
Destructing all norms of life.

Remember who we are
We are the dead mask men
With blood of kith and kin
Roaring on our ancestors peace.

Remember who we are
We are the sinners of life
With perishing the values and morals
Living in submerged blood of almighty.


He is: 

A poor man’s riches
A hungry man’s bread
A sad man’s joy
A sick man’s health
A crippled man’s legs
A deaf man’s ears
A blind man’s eyes
An tired man's rest
A troubled man’s peace
A foolish man’s wisdom
A defeated man’s victory
An insane man’s sanity
A dead man’s life
A lost man’s salvation


Who is mother? ? 
The most beautiful blessing
On the sky, 
The brightest star
Having a heart 
Softer than cotton
With lots of love and care
Flowing like a river
Castle of forgiveness
Minaret of happiness
Knows just to give and share

Who is mother? ? 
The one who bears
Pain for her child
For her child, 
Ready to face 
The game of death
The one who knows
What her child needs
And what doesn't
The one who brings
Everything for her child
Not thinking about herself even

Who is mother? ? 
The elegance of the house
The illumination of the Moon
In a dark night
The enchantment and refreshment
A model of sacrifice
A way to paradise

Who is mother? ? 
The one who cries
When her child cries
The one who smiles
When her child smiles
The one who sews
Without any price
The one who stitches
Without any demand
Whole day
Whole night
The one who can only feel 
Going on our mind
The one who teaches
How to speak
The one who admonishes
How to walk
Holding the finger


Who is mother? ? 
A very sacred relation
An embodiment of patience
An example of modesty
A shadowy tree
In a hot day
A warm blanket 
In a chilled night

Who is mother? ? 
The one who doesn't need
Any reason to pray 
For her child
The one who prays everytime
While waking
While sleeping
The one who starves
When her child starves
The one who eats
When her child eats
The one who advises 
To choose right
To deny wrong
The one who undersatnds
That her child wants

Who is mother? ? 
The one who calls
With a voice
Sweeter than cuckoo
The one who is a shelter
For the torture and trouble
From the people of the world
The one who spends
Sleepless nights for her child
The one who worries
When her child is ill
The one who is anxious
When her child is late
The one whose lap
A place of relief
The one whose dignity
Higher than the Jannah

Who is mother? ? 
Ink will be dried
Bundles of papers will be written
The universe will be perished
Myself will be expired
But I'll remain
Unable to explain

Who is mother? ? 
Who is mother? 


May-be one is now reading this who knows some wrong-doing of my past
         life,
   Or may-be a stranger is reading this who has secretly loved me,
   Or may-be one who meets all my grand assumptions and egotisms with
         derision,
   Or may-be one who is puzzled at me.

   As if I were not puzzled at myself!
   Or as if I never deride myself! (O conscience-struck! O self-
         convicted!)
   Or as if I do not secretly love strangers! (O tenderly, a long time,
         and never avow it;)
   Or as if I did not see, perfectly well, interior in myself, the stuff
         of wrong-doing,
   Or as if it could cease transpiring from me until it must cease.   
   They resented his words for he loathed you, 


The heads of the crowd were smelling like nectar, 
But we objected to the crassness of this somewhat 
Lurid topic of discussion.

I have watched the witchcraft and the birthday, 
I see music ready to roll down hills like water, 
As the contests have been designed and won
After the crowds disperse in this rioting world.

Always the discussed one reads to us aloud, 
Wearing us to the point of illness, 
Like swearing masses and leadership of swearing
And lost reason, the understood one of this age.

They say he matters to the rich among us, 
Between you and me he is a coward of 
Vile munching, eating the foods and drinks
At everyone's expense. 


Who is there? Who does whisper? 
Why do we gather with prosper? 
Why do not we know our coming? 
Why are we around world in roaming? 

Who is the leader? Who is the ruler? 
Who is the farmer? Who brings tiller? 
What are our causes that bring us here? 
Why do we search for happiness and cheer? 

Why is this world so much wonder? 
Why this creation is made for thunder? 
Why do we feel thirst and run fast? 
Where is our beginning? Where is the last? 

Where do we go after death in mystery? 
Why do we born and we grow in history? 
Who does control this time invisible? 
What does that exactly make us unable? 

Why do not we escape from birth and death? 
Why do not we know life's far depth? 
Where do we move? What do here we do? 
Why has this entire Earth turned in to zoo? 

Who is there still in unknown far place? 
Who exactly wins and dandles the race? 
Who takes care of us? Who does fare? 
Where does he whisper? Who is there


I came out alone on my way to my tryst. 
But who is this that follows me in the silent dark? 

I move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not. 

He makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger; 
he adds his loud voice to every word that I utter. 

He is my own little self, my lord, he knows no shame; 
but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company. 


All are born
All are perished
Only one has not
People may change
People may range
Only one cannot change.

You may wage wars
You may run in cars
But you can't reach the stars
You have ignored
You have adored
Only one is matured.

They have gained
They have lost
One has remained static
They play with it
They respect it
They sometimes follow it.

He is the king
All are at it
Many are against it
Many love it
Some hate it.

Can you tell me
Who is this


Everybody needs friends, we all have friends
Some friends are closer to us than our families
If we happen to fall, there are friends to pick us up
What will our life be without friends? 
There are many categories of friendship
There are casual friends, bad friends and good friends
The question here is – who is your best friend? 
Friends who can turn your tears into laughter
Is your wife your best friend? 
I mean the friend you go to
When you need honest advice
Is your husband your best friend? 
I mean the friend who knows you 
More than you know yourself
Is your brother or sister your best friend? 
I mean the friend who always assists you
To solve difficult personal problems
Is your father or mother your best friend? 
I mean the friend you feel safe to keep secrets
Are your in-laws your best friend? 
I mean the friend you can tell anything
Is your boss or co-worker your best friend? 
I mean the friend who can cover you up at work
Is your son or daughter your best friend? 
I mean the friend you use as sounding board
For all your confidential and private thoughts
Is your former classmate your best friend? 
I mean the friend who cheers you up on bad days
Whoever may be your best friend, remember that
A friend in need is always a friend indeed


Who knows what is going on on the other side of each hour?


    How many times the sunrise was
there, behind a mountain!

    How many times the brilliant cloud piling up far off
was already a golden body full of thunder!


    This rose was poison.

    That sword gave life.

    I was thinking of a flowery meadow
at the end of a road,
and found myself in the slough.

    I was thinking of the greatness of what was human,
and found myself in the divine. 


Who'll  be  there  to  hold  my  hand? 
                Who'll  be  standing  by? 
            Will  any  shed  a  tear  for  me
                   As  I  prepare  to  die? 

          Who'll  be  there  to  pray  for  me? 
                 Who'll  be  there  to  sing? 
     And  who'll  be  there  to  kiss  my  cheek
                    If  I  go  in  the  spring? 

     Who  can  say  these  things  for  sure? 
                 Guess  I  should  not  care.
                I  wouldn't  if  I  knew  my  love
                    Was  certain  to  be  there.

                 So  as  the  day  draws  closer, 
                     Guess  I'll  dare  to  deign
         To  ask  if  she  would  care  to  come
                   And  see  me  once  again.

          Should  she  come, I'm  sure  to  leave, 
                       Calm,  without  a  care.
              Joyful  for  all  of  those  who  came, 
                    No  matter  who'll  be  there. 


Who made hell
Beautiful land, mountain, rivers and ocean
Wonderful creatures, plants, birds, animals, 
Day and night, air; to subsist lot of materials. 

He created human, to protect this heaven, 
Then why human is perturbing his creation? 
Why he is making weapon, gun and canon? 
Why creating hatred and killing the human? 

To show power, forces others to succumb, 
To fill own desire make few of them numb, 
For own pleaser causes others to suffer, 
For own richness he grabs wealth of others? 

To answer the profound question, can you tell
It was a heaven, who made the earth hell? 





Who must I be, 
For you, to be with me? 
Must I be the Taxi Driver, 
So I can take you around the globe? 
Must I be the Plumber, 
So I can repair your bathtub? 
Must I be the Surgeon, 
So I can give you a younger face? 
Must I be the Mason, 
So I can build you a mansion, 
A pool - a really exquisite place? 
Must I be the Teacher, 
So I can prepare you for tomorrow? 
I am plunging in a deep sorrow.
Must I be the Preacher, 
Like the one on the TV screen, 
The sweet talker, who can really be slick and mean? 
I simply want you to be mine, 
So I can chat with you day and night, 
So I can always be on sight, 
So you and I can play together, and dine
In the best gourmet restaurant, 
Among the stars that really shine.
I am inviting you to visit my tent
Tonight, before the sun sinks in the ocean, 
Before the swans and the peacocks depart, 
So I can reveal the content of my heart.
It is well known, when you’re near me, I’m in heaven, 
Where flamboyant rainbows decorate the sky; 
I am imagining that you are my favorite apple pie, 
The woman I honestly love, 
The summer wind which carries me above 
The clouds that cruise very far in eternity, 
And yet very close to a newly sustainable reality. 


Like, the deer runs after the mirage
soul wanders to satisfy the desires.
Thirst remains, ever unquenched
as it thinks shining sand, true water.

It flies branch to branch like a bird
finds no place, to have complete rest.
Skipping here and there soul forgets
where’s the correct address of its nest.

Unending desires lead to the causes
of whole worry that soul has to bear.
If needs are kept to the minimum and
felt contented, worries get disappeared.

Who’re devoted to god; need nothing.
Who need nothing, they are the kings


Who paints on this vast canvas
tall trees and fresh green grass? 
Who paints the lucid blue sky
and makes below grey clouds fly? 
Who paints the colorful flowers
 huge ocean, filled in, the water? 
Who paints falling drops of rains
pretty lakes and high mountains? 
Who paints the flowing rivers
flying birds, moving creatures? 
Who paints bed of snow white
shining days and dark nights? 
Opaque rock, transparent glass, 
who paints on this vast canvas? 
To hold red green blue colors
such a huge pots are where


Who peeps on the peeper? 
Who else keeps the peeper peeking, 
Who doesn't get a wink of sleep. 
As those who seek to take a peek.
Believing what is done they do, 
Is out of sight.
Thinking lessons learned.

There's always talk about. 
The getting of sex.
There's always talk about. 
An innocence to protect.
And there's always talk about. 
What children will do next, 
If they don't ignore temptation. 
And practice abstinence.

Who practices abstinence. 
When the meaning's lean on doing.
And who practices abstinence. 
When we're marketed to be teased, 
To please. 
The senses, 
With a pleasure to release.

What possibly could be in the mind of someone, 
Who says and does things with intent.
And not be prepared to deal with the consequences? 

There are those who psychologically maim others.
And expect forgiveness with a forgetting done.
Who prepares the marshmellows roasted by these nutts? 

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. 
And what goes around comes back means nothing to them.
And the older they get, 
It seems the nitwit in them seeks validation! 

What possibly could be in the mind of someone, 
Who says and does things with intent.
And not be prepared to deal with the consequences? 


Who prepares the marshmellows roasted by these nutts

Who’s for the game, the biggest that’s played, 
The red crashing game of a fight? 
Who’ll grip and tackle the job unafraid? 
And who thinks he’d rather sit tight? 
Who’ll toe the line for the signal to ‘Go!’? 
Who’ll give his country a hand? 
Who wants a turn to himself in the show? 
And who wants a seat in the stand? 
Who knows it won’t be a picnic – not much- 
Yet eagerly shoulders a gun? 
Who would much rather come back with a crutch 
Than lie low and be out of the fun? 
Come along, lads – 
But you’ll come on all right – 
For there’s only one course to pursue, 
Your country is up to her neck in a fight, 
And she’s looking and calling for you. 


Depends on if the judge is fair,
Depends how high the heels you wear,
Depends on if they count the hair,
Depends if they allow the chair.


I used to think nurses
Were women,
I used to think police
Were men,
I used to think poets
Were boring,
Until I became one of them. 


Who said.  .. 

This is poetry? 
Who said.  .. 

That the words are free? 
Who said.  .. 

This is you and me, not us or we? 

Tell me! ! ! 

Who said. .. 

Better safe than sorry? 
Who said. .. 

This is my life story? 
Who said. .. 

Don't you hurry, don't you worry? 
 
Tell me the story! ! ! 

Who said. . 

Things I say have been said before? 
Well they can just walk right out the door
Who said.  

Let me say no more? 

Who said. . 

She is just a friend? 
Who said. . 

Please don't pretend? 
Who said. . 

This is where forever ends? 

Who said. . 

And I qoute, 
Things that people wrote, 

Who said. . 

Things that other people say? 
Who said. . 

Words are here to stay? 
That they are for me to say
That I love you everyday? 

Who said. . 

Let my people go? 
And who said. .. 

No? 
Not so long ago.

Now I see some nodding heads
others smiling in the croud
But whom of you had the courage to say:

No, out loud? 
Those of you who did should feel proud.

Let me say. . 

Smiles worth wearing are words worth hearing

That said.  . 

The best sound I've ever heard
Were when no one had said a word.

So who said. . 

The people have spoken? 
Who said. 


This on a Simba chip token? 

Who said. .. 

The past is the past? 
Who said.   

Nothing good will ever last? 

Who said. .. 

Who said. . 


Who said. . 

Who said. . 


Who said. . 

Everything unto thee? 
And finally
Who sai

All of this to me



That heaviest weight of all to bear, 
Inalienable weight of care.

All others are outside myself;
I lock my door and bar them out
The turmoil, tedium, gad-about.

I lock my door upon myself, 
And bar them out; but who shall wall 
Self from myself, most loathed of all?

If I could once lay down myself, 
And start self-purged upon the race 
That all must run ! Death runs apace.

If I could set aside myself, 
And start with lightened heart upon 
The road by all men overgone!

This coward with pathetic voice 
Who craves for ease and rest and joys

Myself, arch-traitor to mysel ; 
My hollowest friend, my deadliest foe, 
My clog whatever road I go.

Yet One there is can curb myself, 
Can roll the strangling load from me 
Break off the yoke and set me free


Who teaches-
the song bird to sing
its chirping song
of wonderful things
who teaches-
the mighty lion to roar
its proud dominance
as it rests on all fours

Who teaches the creatures-
their special abilities

Who teaches-
the earth worm to crawl
on its slimy stomach
as it burrows through the soil
who teaches-
the peregrine falcon to dive
as fast as a hurricane wind
as it soars through the skies

Who teaches the creatures-
their amazing talents

Who teaches-
the blue whale to echo
its voice across the ocean
in its private orchestral show
who teaches-
the arctic tern to migrate
across the span of earth
and reach the Antarctic plate
(it's truly amazing don't you think)  

Who teaches the creatures-
their beautiful skills-
who teaches the creatures-


Who to blame but myself? 
I did not even know 
I was not doing alright.
Who to blame but G-d
For before I was myself 
Who to  blame 
When life does not work out 
As we wanted it to? 
Ourselves? 
Who knows? 
I am just one small person 
In a universe of billions of living things
Billions already dead. 
Why is it so important
What I have done or not done? 
Why do I care so much now 
When I know I too one day 
Perhaps sooner than I expect
I will also not know and care? 
What is to be done about all this


Where is the  spirit of nationalism.
Humanity is no where near humanity.
On the contrary people are busy in fighting for meaningless cause.
Terror for falsehood is growing among masses.
Over of honesty almost finished.
loyalty of measurement is buttering.
Desire of dream  India is simply for selected people only.
Yet another voice for right is on its peak
Our wisdom required to be overhaul.
United  spirit of well being of India is the need  of  the hour. 


I owe my success to you
I am indebted on you, 

On things lost I have no repentance
You are the reason for my existence, 

My words of solitude 
Is interpreted well only by you, 

Let me hold my breath handful
As I do not want to lose you, 

Your gentle and soft touch 
Takes my breath away, 

Why did the breath I exhaled 
took me away! ! ! ! far away.  




They turn the water off, so I live without water,
they build walls higher, so I live without treetops,
they paint the windows black, so I live without sunshine,
they lock my cage, so I live without going anywhere,
they take each last tear I have, I live without tears,
they take my heart and rip it open, I live without heart,
they take my life and crush it, so I live without a future,
they say I am beastly and fiendish, so I have no friends,
they stop up each hope, so I have no passage out of hell,
they give me pain, so I live with pain,
they give me hate, so I live with my hate,
they have changed me, and I am not the same man,
they give me no shower, so I live with my smell,
they separate me from my brothers, so I live without brothers,
who understands me when I say this is beautiful?
who understands me when I say I have found other freedoms?


I cannot fly or make something appear in my hand,
I cannot make the heavens open or the earth tremble,
I can live with myself, and I am amazed at myself, my love, my beauty,
I am taken by my failures, astounded by my fears,
I am stubborn and childish,
in the midst of this wreckage of life they incurred,
I practice being myself,
and I have found parts of myself never dreamed of by me,
they were goaded out from under rocks in my heart
when the walls were built higher,
when the water was turned off and the windows painted black.
I followed these signs
like an old tracker and followed the tracks deep into myself
followed the blood-spotted path,
deeper into dangerous regions, and found so many parts of myself,
who taught me water is not everything,
and gave me new eyes to see through walls,
and when they spoke, sunlight came out of their mouths,
and I was laughing at me with them,
we laughed like children and made pacts to always be loyal,
who understands me when I say this is beautiful


WHO WANTS WAR? 

Who wants war? 
Who wants more dead people? 
More injured people writhing in pain? 
Who wants war? 
Our enemy who would kill us all
And try with all they have 
Forces war upon us-
We don't want war 
They do-
And we must fight to protect ourselves
Who wants war? 
We don't
They do
So there is War. 


Vile base words though flung at me
utterance will never affect my dignity.
Inside my spirit guarded from harm
unaffected by any other's charm
though perhaps lacking praises sung
or be it unheralded by anyone
if but that lone intrinsic voice can sing
with dignity intact I crown me king


At the end of the day when all is still
I've earned my pay, like I always will
My job is done, no more wells to fill

But who will be there for me? 

I have chosen a path that is long and hard
My mind is spent, and my soul is scarred
I've learned that I never let down my guard

But there's nobody there for me; 

It's a difficult task but I do my best
To comfort those who are weak and stressed
The nightmares come and I find no rest
  .
Is there nobody there for me? 

Perhaps there's a place where the soul finds peace
At the end of this road when the trials all cease
And the spirit soars high with a sweet release
.
I'll be free if you're there for me.



WHO WILL OUR ULTIMATE HEIRS BE? 

Who will our ultimate heirs be
Will they even look like us? 
Will they tolerate us 
In all our backwardness? 
Will they be known to us? 
Will we be capable of understanding them? 

Or will they just be strangers in the distance
Who if we are still here and after we are long gone 
Remember us 
As we remember 
tree- shrews and bacteria

A child should always say what's true 
And speak when he is spoken to, 
And behave mannerly at table; 
At least as far as he is able. 


Whole Gulfs -  of Red, and Fleets -  of Red - 
And Crews -  of solid Blood - 
Did place upon the West -  Tonight - 
As 'twere specific Ground - 

And They -  appointed Creatures - 
In Authorized Arrays - 
Due -  promptly -  as a Drama - 
That bows -  and disappears 

-A wholesome number is nine
Ten minus one- a function
Who wants to test a conjunction? 
When one has in hand a ten


In order to tranquilize our mind
We need good environment, 
Saints and nuns pass time in abbey
They abdicate edifice and attachment.

Unhealthy environment brings agony
And creates inquietude, 
Healthy environment becomes wholesome
It generates good aptitude.

Where there are divine families
There the kiddies are divine, 
 They like quietude always
They have their character refine.

That develops the mind to study, 
It is a wholesome environment
Often advice are given by daddy.

Polluted air, water and sound
Pollute the environment easily, 
People inadvertently lead life here
They do it in busily.

To have an all round development 
It needs wholesome environment, 
Beautiful garden, fresh air and refine water
Neat and calm atmosphere brings peace and achievement. 


Sometimes I wonder
If there is a better species than me
But I found after so much search and hard work
Human being is the supreme
Whom I belong to

Then how I could do the deeds
Which can be done by the lower species.
I have the great responsibility and duty
To uplift the human dignity
As I belong to the same community.

How could I believe in those ideas
Where my humanism is wishfully lowered? 
I could not bow down to any thing, to any one
The planets,  the stars,  the moon and  the sun
All are suppose to serve the purpose  of mine


I have the intellect 
I have the language
I have the dream
All are the entities-supreme  
So I belong to
Super human being.

To believe in this 
Fits the things
Makes me high
Puts me on top
Explain the idea of humanism best
No other things than the human being is the greatest.
Whom I belong to

For all these super speciality
I am the supreme
I belong to 

Super human being. 


Once I was lost in the world confusion
And could not decide the right direction
Should I stay put or make a call and go
And prepare a list of friends who act like a foe
First I met with a miser as friend in dire need
He gave but pretension and quickly he fled
Next with whom I made friendship was a liar
Like mirage made distant things appear near
And nearer things made to visualize too far
That folk must be a fool as by me though he stood
But did a great harm in spite of his intention, good
Lately I became friendly with a person so vicious and wicked
That our friendship he sold at the cheapest market. 


Back when I was in Sunday School, 
this kid put a whoopee cushion 
on the pastor’s chair and 
the pastor sat on it during the service. 

Do you think that kid will go to hell 
for doing that? And will I go to hell 
for laughing so hard I nearly passed out? 
I mean, there was no harm in it really. 
Sure, the pastor was steamed. 

But the congregation got 
a good chuckle out of it, 
and it took the excessive solemnity 
out of the service 
and lightened things up – a good thing, 
don’t you think? 

By the way, I’m really enjoying 
having these theological discussions 
with you. Sometimes you seem baffled 
by my questions. That’s okay, 
because we both know 

I’ve already asked him 
about the whoopee cushion thing. 
He hasn’t answered yet 
(I think I’m pretty far back in the queue) , 
but I’ll let you know what he says. 


She strutted about in her knickers
yelling maledictions at the passers-by
not caring who would be offended
by such a crude inturpretation
of improper rebellion. 

Frolicked skipped and we played.
Smiling innocent kids waylaid.
Village paths that were our own.
Where we scampered had kites flown.

Mundane bustle of commoner’s lives
Naively we thought all could thrive
Yet to grow in strength and height.
Oblivious to this satanic blight.

Ghoulish winds have blown us bye.
Thrown in darkness to silent sigh.
The horrid day our way was blocked.
And our life so cruelly rocked.

Used to trail the MP’s car.
Just to touch, now driven so far.
Now we can’t even look up straight! 
For a genuine smile our parents wait! 
O’my you leaders! Have you seen? 
How from innocence children wean.

In carefree time of childhood days.
Barely grasp what the criminal says. 
in wildest dreams had never thought.
Would have to live a lifelong blot.

Begged with pleas and our cries.
To innocence there, said good byes.
Hung upside down in deathly wells.
Felt the shudder of crushing knells.

Shadows crept and the days slipped.
Slowly the curse our smiles sipped.
Now forced to live a tainted life
In broken bits by a thrust strife

O’where the law to secure our land? 
O’whence the law to free our hand? 
Whom shall we blame for our hurt? 
Why our lives now trampled dirt? 
Woe to you leaders! Have you seen? 
How from innocence children wean. 

Whose Pink career may have a close
Portentous as our own, who knows?
To imitate these Neighbors fleet
In awe and innocence, were meet. 



Sparse and bare the trees 
A pleasant morning in the hottest time of the year-


My task here is no more- 

The man I took care of for one year and one half is in his grave
His kind and good wife said goodbye
With a gift for my daughter and her child
And a compensation check for me. 

What Promises are there for me to keep now? 
In these last years
Before I too fade and die? 

The woods are light and small 
And the Developers will soon be here-

I look up out at the Hill of the Holy city
A soft calm wind blows-
Never have I been so still inside-
And miles to go before I sleep? 
The City sad and light and deep. 


Whosoever plants a tree
Winks at immortality.

Woodland cherries, flowers ablaze,
Hold no hint of human praise;

Hazels in a hidden glade
Give no thought to stake or spade;

London planes in Georgian squares
Count no patrons in their prayers;

Seed and sapling seek no cause,
Bark and beetle shun applause;

Leaf and shoot know nought of debt,
Twig and root are dumb— and yet

Choirs of songbirds greet each day
With eulogies, as if to say:

‘Whosoever plants a tree
Winks at immortality!


Why? 
My human eyes gaze at the sky, 
The Beauty imprisoned by the lie, 
My tormented soul wishes to fly, 
My body aching, begging to die.

Why? 
Beauty sleeps in the heart, 
True infinity in everyone's hope, 
Reality and serenity so far apart, 
Oblivion promised at the top of the slope.

Why? 
Constrained by man's domination, 
Twisted by vanity and frustration, 
Fearful of the only solution, 
Absolute peace in emancipation.

Why? 
The dreamer refuses to live a lie, 
Impossibility no matter how hard he may try, 
His broken wings, the final sigh, 
Again Beauty slumbers, humanity's cry.

Why? 
Goodness has fled, Beauty stumbles, 
The truth is red, away life tumbles, 
Cruelty is lead, wickedness rumbles.

Why? 
We are blind, we can't see, 
Our kind is extinct, we must flee, 
Hope we cannot find, so let us be, 
No solace of mind, never again peace. 


Why I am like a raining sky? 
Why I care for those, 
who say to me goodbye? 
Why I am so sensitive and shy? 
Why on little things, 
i start to cry? 
Why everyone thinks me as a toy? 
My mam advises me to be bold, 
and strong like a boy
Because there is no place, 
in this world for a coward guy
I should act upon this advice, 
otherwise no one will say to me 'HI'


Why? 

I feel shame
I killed her
her body weak, tender,  
poor being was petite.

I, brute, with a fist
smashed her made one piece
fly far into sink
while the rest could speak: 
"Did I harm, commit sin? "

Poor cockroach in the cold
hungry and ignored
and yet killed


WHY 

Dark Angel do you put me in chains? 
why do you want to give me all your pains? 
Why do you love to see me cry? 
Oh, please tell me ''WHY.''
In the night I do cry out in so much pains
don't anyone care? 
Why is life so unfair 
Don't you hear my chains shackle in the nights? 
Oh ''WHY, '' do you like to see me cry? 
In my soul I hold the truth to what I know 
In my eyes I see the Visions of Life 
some don't think that is right in their own eyes, 
But when it comes face to face 
my own haters can see I am telling the Truth, 
Dark Angel backed me up in between 
a cold wall of pains and rains 
and a love that never came 
His old agony words eat deep within my soul 
a damped room he keeps me in 
he caged me up like a lion 
I remain in a darken place 
a place of darken dreams that makes one scream 
but within in time of Dark Angels lies 
I became numb in despair
the chill engulfs deep within my veins
holding on too so much pains
Dark Angel only knows his own games
he hold shadows of dark notion 
that holds lies and angers that drat the minds
eloquence of darkness casting away truth of love, 
that makes the hearts ache 
it levels a pain so deep crushes out the free
that leaves the soul to weep
with a doomed faith that leads to hate
Pain's invention, admonish of true love, 
darkness preys behind my own eyes 
Now I see what it is I never wanted to be
I feel the cuts deep into my gut
I can feel the emptiness running deep within my soul
oh how this darkness is making me almost lose control.
I almost felt I will never be free 
Dark Angel ''WHY, '' do you want to hurt me? 





I had an idea in my head 
I pictured this going differently
I meant every word that I said
You should have spent more time listening
All the things that I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a 'hold on'
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long

Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show? Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show? Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love

I had an idea in my head
I pictured this going differently
Even when you sleep in my bed
I know you're not mine officially
And all the things I put a hold on
All for you to hit me with a 'hold on'
What makes you so ready right now
After I waited on you for so long



Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show? Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love
Why you wanna be my love, is it just for show? Why you wanna be my love, my love, my love, love

why you want to, tell me why you want to


why? is man or woman chosen to be
or do we create our own destiny? 
   if man sits idley by
and does not even get up to try.
will he be the chosen one
or will he be the earths scum.

why?  is the question that we must ask
or will we be put to a task.
    if a person is born blind. why? 
are they and not i? 

we must all be put to a test
to try to create or do our best.
and if we do not try.
the question will always come up- why? 

why? should be the key
for it may hold our destiny.
   now you may understand what i am saying
and 'why? ' so many people are praying

and asking the LORD up above
    'why? '  can't we understand love.


American Detectives
Never remove their hats
When investigating murders
In other people's flats.

they always appear
Bare-headed


Why has the flowers withered and gone.
why was she not the one for me.
Why does the sun revolve around the moon.
Why does the lonely man still have no one.
Karma does bite the soul of him.
 Him vs her where is this name begin.
But as he ventures forward.
not a sound in the garden


Why cant i sleep at night? 
why must i watch mom cry? 
why couldnt i be a child? 
why must my emotions hide? 

why do you yell? 
why wont i cry? 
why am i so messed up? 
why cant i die? 

why am i miserable, 
just to make you happy? 
why cant the pain go numb? 
why do the bad feelings trap me? 


why was i born? 
why must i be stronger? 
The answer is you, 
my 'loving' father. 


Ever, ever
Stir and shiver
The reeds and rushes
By the river:
Ever, ever,
As if in dream,
The lone moon's silver
Sleeks the stream.
What old sorrow,
What lost love,
Moon, reeds, rushes,
Dream you 


i asked myself why? 
i have no answer
i asked people why? 
they did'nt have the answer either
i'm waitin
i'm still waitin
when will i get the answer 
but i'm waitin anyway
why it have to be like this-
there's somethin i need
don't know what
i tried to find it
don't know where to go
i feel tired and numb
i asked myself again
'what's this'
Lil voice in my heart tells me
'THIS IS LIFE'you and i fight, 
a lot
i dont know why, 
we were just talking and out of nowhere, 
a line of profanaties aimed directly at me, 
you broke up with me, 
so why do you keep coming back, 
you said i was a rebound, nothing important, 
then you said you loved me, 
now you take it back, 
why are you so confusing, 
why cant you just make up your mind, 
ive moved on this time.
Now you come back and ask for me to love you, 
 if at least for a day, 
like the idiot you pegged me for i did.
i dont regret it, you dont either, 
im glad of that, 
but still afterwards you said you hated me, 
i was naive and immature, 
 to think anything we had had meant anything, 
you threw it all back in my face, 
thanks for that, 
im glad to know what you think, 
it helped me get over you, 
To find some love until World`s end.



He looked at us from Holly Sky
And wanted know why people cry.


The Angels passed through our mind, 
They didn`t know if love they find-
A lot of loneliness and pain
They saw all pictures from the brain.

But could not find our hearts` warm
Just saw an influence of corn, 
Just felt the doom of our dread, 
They saw all dreams we`ve ever had.

They saw all people were just weak, 
They just existed, didn`t seek
To find the light, because blind eyes
Could not in heart it recognize.

The angels though they won`t us leave, 
Because in saving we believe, 
Because we needed them at all, 
They did not wait for our fall.

To stay in love, with angels dance, 
To give us warm we`ve lost in fear, 
They promised Him of us take care.

So, now all people are not slave, 
They reach all dreams their souls crave.
And if they`re lonely, live in tear, 
They should remember Angels near. 


Life is cheerful, life is light
Why are not you feeling bright? 
Night gives you fear, oh my dear
You are in stress, put your gear.

Year or day here do not you stay? 
For every action price you do pay.
Say you not why? Problem what is? 
Remain fearless you are son of his.

Own doings come back as reaction.
Why are you breaking in this stress? 
Feel life more you feel stress less.

Press your pain dress love wisdom, 
Yes, yes very fine get life system.
Suppress you sorrow and surrender, 

Tender life feel remove your pain, 
You live in light, light it does gain.
Do not break in stress, soon do nod. 



Why bother being kind to those, 
who seem to treat you bad? 
Those who drive you crazy, 
and make you feel so mad? 
Without the blanket coverage, 
of all Folks in the loop, 
Someone, someday, may miss out, 
and that would never do

Why did baby die, 
Making Father sigh, 
Mother cry? 
Flowers, that bloom to die, 
Make no reply 
Of ‘why?’ 
But bow and die. 


Why did I laugh tonight? No voice will tell
Deigns to reply from heaven or from hell
Then to my human heart I turn at once:
Heart, thou and I are here, sad and alone,
Say, why did I laugh? O mortal pain!
O darkness! darkness! Forever must I moan
To question heaven and hell and heart in vain?
Why did I laugh? I know this being's lease
My fancy to it's utmost blisses spreads
Yet would I on this very midnight cease
And all the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds
Verse, fame and beauty are intense indeed
But death intenser, death is life's high meed.


‘Why did you choose me Mummy’? 
I might ask you the same
‘Why did YOU choose me? ’
 I muse in quiet contentment. 


Across the years I waited. 
You gave me no clear signal you were coming, 
yet something in me knew.
The vague sense of distant footsteps, 
that the steady pulse of my life 
beat in time, with another’s rhythm.


You came.

My door’s bright light catching a startled baby rabbit.
Piercing Romany eyes gazing out from the gloom, 
staring from the passageway, 
panicking, paranoid with uncertainty.
A bath, to warm and soothe 
and you just scream and scream and scream.
You are afraid of everything.
The car wash, strangers, even new shoes

At bed time always I must close your door, with lights out.
And you never, never, never leave your bedroom
until I come to find you.
Floppy baby boy, not used to being held.
Two precious birthdays gone, 
finding no comfort in my embrace.
I search for tight, breath held connection.
Though you have never allowed kisses 


Then you started to dance, in your own unique way. 
Eye contact optional, gaze often turned inward. 
Inviting brief companion, 
although measured with solemn, mute composure. 
A quiet observer, 
cautious holding hands.
So we shadow danced through tantrums, 
 Well meant ‘professional opinions’

We seek support for an application to love you. 
While all the time working, to find that single link
you could hang your trust upon.
We meet ongoing intrusive investigation.
That we loved you seemed inadequate 
‘How can you meet his ethnic needs’? 
What does ‘dual heritage’ mean, 
in the context of our love? 


‘Why did you choose me Mummy’? 

Heartfelt explanation-
‘Hearts come home. You have returned to where you were grown, 
where you were sewn and nurtured’.
‘You were in me from the very beginning.
A whisper of a seed
I  would reap; my special harvest.
My darling son; you grew in my heart.
And hearts are the same colour. 

Why do I hate my homework? 
It is a pest like a brother
Or a sister of another
It is like a very boring book
Or like my mom’s disgusting cook
It is a creature of its own
The kind that makes me gag and moan

Why do I hate my homework? 
I really hate my homework
It makes me want to go berserk
I don’t want to do my homework today
Nor tomorrow or the h of May
Homework is like poisonous snakes
Or the mystery meat my cafeteria makes

I rather listen to my Ipod
Then write an essay about Cape Cod
I rather spend my days staring at the sun
Then do my homework that needs to be done
I rather swim in a pool with a shark
Then learn fractions with my math teacher, Mr. Clark
And this is why I hate my homework




Why do I love?
Is it for men to choose
The hour of the hushed night when crowned with dews
From its sea grave the morning star shall wake?
Lo, while we drowsed, it rose on our heart's ache,
And all our heaven was red with the day's hues,
And glad birds chaunted from the trees above.
So was it with my heart that might not choose
But woke to love.


Why do I love?
The aureole of lost days
Is on thy brow and unforgotten face;
Faith's guiding light, the same which of old time
Sent men on knightly quests to deeds sublime
And the high prize which was their lady's grace.
Thither I follow, careless what shall prove,
So only at thy knees a little space
I too may love.

Why do I love?
The paths of life are steep,
And dark the issues and the gulfs how deep!
This wayside shrine invites my knees to kneel.
Thou, dearest Saint, in witness of my zeal
Biddest me walk in joy who only weep,
And fare forth comforted who vainly strove.
See how my steps in thy sweet service leap!
See how I love!


Why do I love?
There is a dream that stirs
My soul to its last depth of lost desires,
Music of waters in a thirsty land,
A step, a touch, the lingering of a hand,
Fingers that are the soft Spring's messengers,
And lips that to my kisses part and move
With passionate words which yet--how strange!--are hers,
Pleading for love.


Why do I love?
If one had told me this,
When I erewhile in the world's wilderness
Wandered uncertain or of Heaven or Hell,
How had I laughed as at a time--worn tale!
To--day, behold. I too speak prophecies,
And hang my votive garland in the grove,
And supplicate my god, and kneel and kiss
Her feet for love.


Why do I love?
Ah, love, I will not make
A longer reasoning even for thy sake;
Be it enough that I am pleasure's thrall.
Tell me thy will, in song or madrigal
Or word unspoken. Bid me bend or break,
And brave all wraths of Earth or Heaven above,
But not thy wrath. Ah! bid me not awake.
Bid me still love. 


Why do i love you I ask myself lover? 
What have you done so unique from another? 
Your physical beauty of which you could boast
Is kept subtle and secondary which I prefer most

Your true beauty though you dare not to hide
Are the thoughts and the feelings you don't keep inside
You share them with me and i feel each day better
I'd eat junk mail all week just to get to your letter


When i hold you and feel you its more than a touch
It's a movement and a symphony you love me so much

So why do i love you? I 've tried to discern
Living without you would give me heartburn

Why do i love you? I have tried and tried to say
It grows yes it grows more with each passing day

Why do i love you?  you dared set me free
Well i know one more reason, 
I know you love me



Why do I love you? 
let me count the ways.

I love you
Because you're you..
My heart sees what my eyes can't
You accepted me for who I am and who I'm not
You believe in a way I can
You take me out inside the shell
And greet the world with a smile..
You bring out the best in me
But take nothing in returned
You showed me how to love and be loved
You  guide  me in every step I make
And catch me whenever I fall..
Whe


I'm feeling down and blue.
You make me laugh those corny jokes of yours..
Kiss away my tears and wipe away my sorrow..
Most of all
You love me like you do


"Why do I love" You, Sir?
Because—
The Wind does not require the Grass
To answer—Wherefore when He pass
She cannot keep Her place.

Because He knows—and
Do not You—
And We know not—
Enough for Us
The Wisdom it be so—


The Lightning—never asked an Eye
Wherefore it shut—when He was by—
Because He knows it cannot speak—
And reasons not contained—
—Of Talk—
There be—preferred by Daintier Folk—

The Sunrise—Sire—compelleth Me—
Because He's Sunrise—and I see—
Therefore—Then—
I love Thee—because people always forgive them
again and again and again and again and again and again.

Knowledge is the light knowledge is the might, 
While we fumble knowledge we don't fight.
Some fumble in darkness is like just ignorance, 
It is not so right way but they loss their chance. 

Oh dear people, please tell why do we fumble? 
We do search more and keep things in jumble.
We stand up; we sit down and also do tumble, 
Without getting anything suddenly we stumble. 

We do tremble in fear sometimes in jerk, 
In happiness we wander in pressure we work.
While a person fumbles some say him berk, 
While he delights in knowledge he stays in perk. 

Inside matters some fumble for money and wealth, 
However they do forget about mind and health.
Those are wise fumble inside values and purity, 

We are souls conscious we are ever eternal, 
We forget our qualities and wander in external.
Our vision should be fixed surely for divine light, 
Bullets whizing past, bombs hail their unmerciful blasts, 
Clouds of dust plume, darkness on the battlefield looms, 
Men taking their last breath awaiting their impeding death.


For what grievance do they owe this horror? 
People on both sides lost their lives, 
And for what honour? 
To be forgotten by those they died for? 
To be permanently lost to their families, what were those tears they cried for? 

Bodies lie mangled and rotten, 
All their cries of pain, forgotten, 
Lifeless testaments to Man's great shame, 
Killing the innocents of our time, 
These are our Brothers and Sisters that must suffer this horrid crime.


Men disappear in a flash, 
Letters from loved ones lost in the crater, 
This futile conflict, a circus of human frailty, 
The blood is on those who so vehemently oppose these natives.

Such hatred they breed fuelled by their heartless greed, 
Bloodlust and revenge are Man's modern creed, 
True Patriotism is lost, at such a cost, 
Replaced with a lie for those who wish to kill and die, 
For a country unworthy of their blood. 


Why are ye torturing me, O desires of my heart? 
Torturing me and paining me by day and by night? 
Hunting me as a poor deer would be hunted on a hill,
A poor long-wearied deer with the hound-pack after him
There's no ease to my paining in the loneliness of the hills,
But the cry of the hunters terrifically to be heard,
The cry of my desires haunting me without respite,—
O ravening hounds, long is your run! 
No satisfying can come to my desires while I live,
For the satisfaction I desired yesterday is no satisfaction,
And the hound-pack is the greedier of the satisfaction it has got,—
And forever I shall not sleep till I sleep in the grave. 


Why does a person fear? 
Why does he or she loss cheer? 
How does a person achieve? 
How does one get mischief? 

What is the aim of a life? 
Is the age sixty of a person ripe? 
Why does a person miscarry? 
Why does a person speculate fairy? 

How to survive in this earth? 
Can a person avoid rebirth? 
Many questions arises in person’s mind, 
What are the solutions have to find? 

A person fear for his or her unjust work, 
Telling a lie leads him or her to murk.
Virtuous qualities like truth and nonviolence, 
Bring a person peace, bliss and silence.

Noble works, hard labour bring ascent for person, 
Meditation brings calmness and righteous action.
Aim of life should be to do good for nation, 
And to do for soul will always be the notion.

Night comes after day and vice versa is sure, 
Rebirth must come after death, action should be pure.
Let’s meditate him and save life from hood’s tale. 


When the sun shows off its yellow teeth
In my eyes full of sleep
I laugh
And tie up all my sufferings in a knot
To put them in my heart's almirah.

When darkness and silence together
Knock on my window
I laugh
And birds resting on my lips
Fly away.


When for the sake of a handful of water
Empty and hypocrite hands
Fill up with prayers
I laugh
And in the rain of my laughter
Dry lakes quench their thirst.

But when in my wisdom filled silence
She does not acknowledge my existence
I laugh
And laughing, I start crying.  


It gets so unbearable
It never is fair
Nor is it right
It makes us cry in the middle of the night
Always seems to give scary thoughts
Makeing people want to die
Everyone always asks why
You will spend your whole
life wondering why
I wish I could say other wise
But for now


I just can't
Please know in time
It will be alright


Jilted Love

Do you think of me sweet heart? 
In your life, do I still have a part? 
Now if you see me cry? 
Will you just pass me by? 
Do you know that I love you so? 
Know that I need to with you go? 
Do you remember the day? 
Together when we used to pray? 
Weren’t we so happy and gay? 
Have we really parted our way? 
Do you still hear the songs? 
Where did you see any wrongs? 
Dear do you still love my laughter? 
Do memories linger of the day after? 
Remember when we kissed my dear? 
Did the world we see have any fear? 
Sweet heart may I come back again? 
Or will I hear the usual refrain? 
Won’t you dear be little more caring? 
Would you the void, stop now staring? 
Does your core moan and bleed? 
Why won’t you then, dear me heed? 


If there was a chance in hell
That you could save us -
Why don't you try? 

If your words could ease the pain
That hangs between us -
Why don't you try? 

If you love me as you say 
Beyond tomorrow -
Why don't you try? 

In my silence lies the truth
It's up to you now -
Why don't you try? 

I guess I have my answer then.


Why drive? 

Body hurts
From toes to my head
And to arms, legs and tail.

And still I drive, in hands wheel.

Yes money is needed
But isn't all the deed.

I look and learn; seeing
Take photos, reserving
Memories in changing


Walls and shops, streets and repairs
Here, there, the cars and bicycles
The people in and on and behave, 
And artworks, and paintings everywhere.

Driving is hard and dangerous
But still is a source, precious
Doing right, doing wrong
Observing what goes on.

Driving as I find is my source
And is root and trunk, inspires. 


Why east wind chills and south wind cools
Shall not be known till windwell dries
And west's no longer drowned
In winds that bring the fruit and rind
Of many a hundred falls;
Why silk is soft and the stone wounds
The child shall question all his days,
Why night-time rain and the breast's blood
Both quench his thirst he'll have a black reply.


When cometh Jack Frost? the children ask.
Shall they clasp a comet in their fists?
Not till, from high and low, their dust
Sprinkles in children's eyes a long-last sleep
And dusk is crowded with the children's ghosts,
Shall a white answer echo from the rooftops.

All things are known: the stars' advice
Calls some content to travel with the winds,
Though what the stars ask as they round
Time upon time the towers of the skies
Is heard but little till the stars go out.
I hear content, and 'Be Content'
Ring like a handbell through the corridors,
And 'Know no answer,' and I know
No answer to the children's cry
Of echo's answer and the man of frost
And ghostly comets over the raised fists. 


Why fear? 

When comes pains
Come like rain
Of all sides, all aspects
Life and wife, also child
From friends, in and out
Enemy; if any.

When seat is on the nails
Is engulfed with flames
Or on waves, in thunder
Say: "Good bye" to fear
Take the deepest breath: 
"What can be beyond death? "

Now roll up the sleeves
Take steps cautiously
Do not add to the mess
Yourself first for address: 
"Go easy."


Open knots one by one
Slowly, very wise.

You will face one of two
May fail or, see success.


Why fear

Why hack my mind? 
I can be bare and nude.

Why do hush-hush eye scallop? 
My chaste boobs
I can strip off veil for revel
Egressing 'no-bra-look'. 

Why scope scoop tangently lips?    
Lend red from beguiling xx blood 
To satiate you lip hunger.


Why itch psychically in
Nibble nimble thighs and triangle 
                                  in between? 
Dive dip deep in horripilant 
River Ganga Yamuna
I can lay bedecking billow bed. 

Stop hacking
Stop itching
Stop scooping
Stop scoping. 

Hey come  
Bare nude
Together for sure 
Flush all impure
Into unmarred pure
Make us yours

Why then hack my She? 



Why have you destroyed
All the flowers? 
Were the flowers your enemies


Once there was spring all around
With plants and blooms in shade and scent abound
Butterflies from here and there and places unseen
Flitted back and forth in colorful sheen

Birds sang tuneful songs of contentment
Squirrels and bunnies hopped in spirits buoyant
But all along now I see trees, leafless and bare
Nakedly shivering in winter’s chilly air

Even when the Earth adorns in full glory
Here I bide alone, so dull and dreary
Oh! Dear! Why have you hurriedly left me? 
Was it to make me drift aimless in this turbulent sea? 


We were once a happy pair of doves
Seeking warmth under each other’s wings
By sundown, we flew to our evening nest
Under temple spires, we sought easeful rest

We walked the meadows, gathering spring flowers
We roamed aimless through ocean strands
We watched life’s ceaseless ebb and flow
We waited eager to grab life’s evanescent glow

We knew sorrow’s depth and worth
Each morn, for us, was love’s rebirth
We walked close to paths supernal
And lived ever in love eternal


Now I have lost the rhyme n’ rhythm of life
I see the world around with sorrows rife
I am a broken reed far beyond repair
With no songs to be played now or ever

Once we danced to the rising and lilting measure
Each synchronized step, we took with such pleasure
Oh! I hear from far, your anklets rhyme and chime
They ring in my ears through the time

Each wayside flower to me recalls your lovelorn face
The wind swayed lilacs reflect your grace
Deep in silent night the odor of your flowing hair
Comes wafting, and for a while, I feel you near

A boundless emptiness often fills my space
The question –‘What next’ stares at my face
Yet never shall I yield, but shall bravely sail
Hoping, we together shall meet at the Golden Dale


‘Why I am doing this
That I know
And I am sure.
Yes I can  say
I am here
And I am pure.
And with my words
You can be cured. 


Why I am driven towards you
What I see that none can see
The wonderful beauty treasure
The unfathomable pleasure
Why none but you
Knock the door of my heart
I feel and I do see
The science of life in art
The emotion that I can't resist
Your unfolding charm does persist
Why I want to explore
The hidden art and texture
Why I want more and more
Love and unquenchable pleasure
I can't wait for you in queue
Why I am driven toward you



It was an Essay 
An effort to perform or attempt 
A French Word
In writing

That was an official motto 
In USA replacing In Revolutions
Bravely speaking out

But he was also against 
Mass production
Globalization
Slavery

The world’s need for needle
Is limited so if. 
The question was 
What if. ? 

What if machine fulfills
A year’s need
In a day
What then? 

Unemployment
Jobless machine
He said and.  

And? 
His comment fell on deaf ears


Ownership of wealth is
 holding one percent 
And One percent  
Get ready for disaster.  

I am not a painter, I am a poet.
Why? I think I would rather be
a painter, but I am not. Well,

for instance, Mike Goldberg
is starting a painting. I drop in.
"Sit down and have a drink" he
says. I drink; we drink. I look
up. "You have SARDINES in it

"
"Yes, it needed something there

"
"Oh

" I go and the days go by
and I drop in again. The painting
is going on, and I go, and the days
go by. I drop in. The painting is
finished. "Where's SARDINES?"
All that's left is just
letters, "It was too much," Mike says.


But me? One day I am thinking of
a color: orange. I write a line
about orange. Pretty soon it is a
whole page of words, not lines.
Then another page. There should be
so much more, not of orange, of
words, of how terrible orange is
and life. Days go by. It is even in
is finished and I haven't mentioned
orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call
it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery
I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES.

A breath of fresh air for life. 


Why I love

In Chaco some tree looks a vase
"He was man-" locals say 
"-was lazy, sat at home; never worked, 
saved water



"Black bird was a girl-" 
the same is for others-

Oruro is the best
everything was a man; 
hills and sand
the mountains, and the rest.

This is why I love them
and their ways-

They are me in childhood
wandering in alleys and plains
the muddy birthplace, 
everyone was part of 
near, far, family
relative changing forms


Did I mean why I love writing poems? 
Nevertheless, I love writing poems or poetry: 
To simply have fun, make others happy, 
Inspire and defend others; to fan the flames
Of fairness, and to seek justice for the weak, 
The innocents, the underprivileged, and the sick; 
I can go on and on until I lose consciousness.
I love expressing myself with elegance and neatness.
Ordinary jerks always make fun of the Poets, that's not new; 
And the Poets know darn well how to take care of them too.
Poets have thick skin; they are Heroes without fears.
They struggle, fight, write, raise hell and wipe their tears.
Sorry, if I am going astray, that's what I do best, 
Sometimes, like any human being, I like to make a mess.
That's why I love writing essays, poems or poetry: 
To simply have fun, and to make others happy.
At the same time, I want others to criticize, and castigate.
I make my own decisions, and can determine my own fate.
Poets have thick skin, and by nature have no fears.
Please swallow your frown, your smile, and wipe your tears. 


You give to me hope
And help me to cope
When life pulls me down
You bring me around

You teach me to care
And help me to share
You make me honest
With kindness the best

From you I learned love
With grace from above
It's for you I live
And I want to give

You are the reason
That fills each season
When I hear love I think of you
You are my world and best friend too


I love you because you are so kind, thoughtful and caring
I love you because you are so pleasant, lovely and sharing

You made me the man I am
Thank you

You may ask, 
Why am I conservative? 
Shouldn't you be a democrat? 

That is not a question for many, 
Well, not even for a few, 
The problem is that it may not be even a question for you! 

However, this question is still here, 
Therefore, I will explain, 
It didn't all happen in a short period of time. 

The first myth is, 
All conservatives are well off, 
This can't be true, 
No one has been worse managing money than I do. 

The second myth is, 
All conservatives are in the religious right. 
This can't be true, 
No one has worse church attendance than I do. 


The third myth is, 
If you work for a living you are poor, 
If your are poor you are then a democrat. 
Now, this is one statement, 
I would love to take back. 
I have worked all of my life, 
Laid off jobs, 
Been fired too, 
SIgned up for Food Stamps, 
The whole nine yards, 
All the time, 

When I worked in the steel business, 
Their answer was another weeks of unemployment, 
When I work in sales, 
Their answer was another weeks of unemployment. 
After the events of  
What was their answer? 
A resounding democratic cry, 
'weeks of employment! ' 

I believe, 
I now know what to do, 
Let's give the Congress the answer, 
Give the democrats what they like 
The Unemployment line


Once I was sitting under the tree. 

The sun sit in a muddy spring.
The flowers were crying beside me. And a bird wounded his wing. 
I raised my sight, awh what I see.  A storm and great thundering.
I worried, what will happen to me. I was lost in a mysterious ring.


All my grief got into my mind. 
I felt the importance of life.
And I felt that I became blind. 

I've cut pain through a knife.
I thought to walk against the wind, 
and put an end for that strife.


I said why am I sad? Why I care about that grief, while others are happy.

I pray for the following in the prosaic manners below; 



Think for a while, this is our sovereignty here, we are enjoying.

I pray for my mother, language and land and people at large


Was ever a maiden so worried?
I’ll admit I am partial to Jim,
For Jimmie has promised to wed me
When I’m old enough to wed him.

But then I love teacher, too, dearly,
She’s always so lovely to me,
And she’s pretty and kind and sweet-tempered,
And gentle as gentle can be.

I wouldn’t for worlds hurt Jim’s feelings,
For he never would like me again—
But there was my dearest, sweet teacher,
And I’d die if my words gave her pain.

'Two plus two equals what?' was the problem.
And I knew teacher thought it made 'four';
But Jimmie said 'six,' and maintained it
As long as he stood on the floor.

And I saw I must soon choose between them,
For I was the next in the line.
Should I side with my teacher or Jimmie?
What a sad situation was mine!

And just as my heart with that problem
Of friendship was so sorely vexed
I was called on to answer the other,
For teacher had said, sharply, 'Next!'

It was then that the brilliant thought struck me,
That by compromise I could contrive
To hurt neither teacher nor Jimmie,
And that’s how I came to say 'five.


'Give not anything
If it is yours
And you do not want
To give to anybody
But give not anything
In this higgling ways, 
And who are you to give
Asked yourself at this time
And who are you
How you got what
You should know first and
You should clarified
Before all openly
The relation of thing with you.      


Why is Life (Your Humble Coat of Many Colours)                 
          

           From whence you started out.
To survey the unique position you are in today.
Perhaps you find your plate so piled high with doubt? 
A  Paragon of words abound, use them how you may.
Be not set with vitriolic gremlins misery plagued.
I would rather stare into space than take much time to say.
If your humble fate is in your own hands anyway? 
Rewarding Mothers of Invention throughout every live long day.


You are Alive and to the Manor born.
The moment you discovered words and phrases.
To rhyme and rhythm, your lot to thrive upon.
Your transport vehicle to a thousand places.
Embroider each and every line you write.
The monument can ride out of mystic phases, 
The ticket on this journey, yours by right.
Identity hidden by a million Poet faces, 
True colour to your verse within the woven traces.

But my Poet Friend just be aware lest you be forgetting
The body that you inhabit is but a cloak to gain your entry, 
To a position of great power one that up to date has had you guessing.
Your mission in this Life is to be revealed sometime, eventually.
But until the Masters are both satisfied, please watch your P`s and Q`s
As a youth you have an impatient way about you, 
Forget your thoughts of death, seeds planted to serve just to confuse.
My advice to you my dear to stop acting as a Fool.


Why is this age worse than earlier ages?
In a stupor of grief and dread
have we not fingered the foulest wounds
and left them unhealed by our hands?

In the west the falling light still glows,
and the clustered housetops glitter in the sun,
but here Death is already chalking the doors with crosses,
and calling the ravens, and the ravens are flying in. 


Love is a river
In our life it flows
A small seed that grows
A flower without beauty
A beauty without a face
Ageless without origin
Sweet like sugar
Bitter like liquor 
A supernatural force 
That causes hearts to attract 
To another half.
To form one part.

 
When this river stops
The flower will die
Sometimes our eyes cry
Sugar turns to salt
Sometimes it's not our fault
Now our lives are bitter
Two hearts design forever 
Divided, It hurts! because
Love was meant forever. 


When the hopes are hassled
And relationships are rattled
                                        Naïvete asks, why me? 
 When wishes are whacked 
And dreams are dashed
                                        Naïvete asks, why me? 
When fantasies are fettered
And blessings are battered
                                         Naïvete asks, why me? 
When desires are demolished 
And ambitions are admonished
                                        Naïvete asks, why me? 
When temptations are traumatized
And passions are pulverized
                                         Naïvete asks, why me? 

Strangely, 

Naïvete with influence
And naïvete with affluence
                                      Never asks, why me? 
Naïvete with name
And naïvete with fame
                                     Never asks, why me?  
Naïvete with health
And naïvete with wealth
                                     Never asks, why me? 
Naïvete with fiefdom
And naïvete with wisdom
                                     Never asks, why me? 
Naïvete with beauty 
And naïvete with booty 
                                     Never asks, why me



Why? They fall into the lovers feminine boudoir trap
‘Cos their lovely with their soft silky smile, 
Some wiggle when they walk man raises his cap
Some giggle when they talk just to release a net of beguile, 

Perfume and powder wafts into their nose
Makes em' dizzy an' they run off to the shop, 
To buy a beautiful flowering rose
This love bug will never stop.

Sky high heels and very short skirts
Sets the pace to reel em' in, 
It catches hundreds of love struck flirts
That's when falling in love doth begin

No way a good man will live in sin
So they buy a huge diamond ring an'
There in love ding a ling ding.
Let the wedding bells begin! 

Woman that's why man falls in love
The cause is surely a sign from above, 
So now I'm off to a woman to meet
Then firstly remove my tongue from it's cheek


Why must love be so very hard
How come it makes us cry
What makes it so very good
Why do we waist our time
how come you can't say why
What made it so very hard
I never want to love again


The morning that the world began
The Lion growled a growl at Man.

And I suspect the Lion might
(If he'd been closer) have tried a bite.

I think that's as it ought to be
And not as it was taught to me.

I think the Lion has a right
To growl a growl and bite a bite.

And if the Lion bothered Adam,
He should have growled right back at 'im.

The way to treat a Lion right
Is growl for growl and bite for bite.

True, the Lion is better fit
For biting than for being bit.

But if you look him in the eye
You'll find the Lion's rather shy.

He really wants someone to pet him.
The trouble is: his teeth won't let him.

He has a heart of gold beneath
But the Lion just can't trust his teeth.


Rain drops blended with tears
Fell on her cheeks
Wind wiped out those drops
To find a solution for her sanctity

The agony in our life
marked unto pebbles
Conveyed the message
Not to cry again

Wipe out tears of fear
And raise out questions of justice
Why not capital punishment
To whom those who indulged

Remember the sacrifices
To all whom lost their lives
for the cause of women hood
to maintain their sanctity. 



Why not TV? 

He was young, very young; words were carved in depth of his dark eyes
His look talked before tongue; I cautious and afraid.

I was not an Afghan, I opposed rulers’ line, but
Read books; book seller had informed and betrayed; I was called.

Prepared with the names that friend had given I knew Baraki Barak.
I hid the illegals, my passport being corrupt; I gave names, relations.

Questioner knew names; I was saved.

Things went well and too fast; I ended in safe hands; 
These young men, devoted and honest, were handsome.
Trusted, I joined them for the lunch after talk with their boss.

Spread table cloth on the floor, Dastar-Khan, meant lunchtime. 
Two came to set the things according to Islam; poured water, we washed hands.

Generous they were and, I was guest; served me well

My skin kettle’s led, was heated with fever of questions, yet controlled.
Weak prey in their hands, I was a powerless chick or hen, and afraid.

I could see in man’s mind cooked something; I saw eyes: 
"We share much, but still no trust."

In my heart I heard him: 
"I am one, single one, a member to a whole, the whole is Taliban, but not I."
I could see a writing in his eyes: 
"You are dumb, stupid, do not understand. You call me, plural-Taliban." 

Carefully, cautiously, I mentioned the TV, sought reply: 
"We want it but experts betray us; so we wait to right time, our own men."



"Why do people not put me in their mouths? 
Am i not tasty? 
do i not make them have a nice feeling? 
do i smell? 
please tell me why O why! 
am i the only one thats going to not be eaten
i feel so sad
so left out 
Does anyone like me


Why  flames of violence has erupted all  around
Who has poisoned the minds of these budding hearts
Is it anguish of  some witnessed  inhuman tragedy 
or  hatred  of some society’s misconduct
Whether  these hands are devoid  work of choice
or carried away by the satans of caste, religion and divisive acts.

Why this noble woman has picked  weapons for destruction
Till yesterday was an embodiment of love  peace and affection
Why  today her hands are colored with strains of violent  blood
limit of her  tolerance might have  been broken
By these feudal and the traders of mankind


Why these youths are playing with explosives and hand grenades
Why they are too passionate towards bullets and guns
Childhood might have been devoid of  play, toys and  love of mother 
Left out humanity might have been exploited
By their employers and the crooked masters.

Mankind should be saved from this curse of violence
Elite, civilized and the good governance has to come forward
Every hand has to be engaged with the work of  choice
Every heart has to be loved. respected and given the rightful place.

Terrorism and violence  may  pull the last curtain on the life of kalyug.
Considering  creation of  men before making  the new world
Or may remain contented with amoeba, plants and animal kingdom. 


You can find many detesting
On one protesting
When men beat women
Nothing has changed for them
Loopholes in the legal and administrative system
Perpetuates the prevailing bad system
Culprit are not punished
Good person who fight for a cause
Behind the bars, they are pushed
Power, position and wealth
Safeguards for erring youth
If you want to bring a change
Fight at all level and age
You may not be able to see the change
But change will come only when you change


Didn't you like the way the ants help
the peony globes open by eating the glue off?
Weren't you cheered to see the ironworkers
sitting on an I-beam dangling from a cable,
in a row, like starlings, eating lunch, maybe
baloney on white with fluorescent mustard?
Wasn't it a revelation to waggle
from the estuary all the way up the river,
the kill, the pirle, the run, the rent, the beck,
the sike barely trickling, to the shock of a spring?
Didn't you almost shiver, hearing book lice
clicking their sexual dissonance inside an old
Webster's New International, perhaps having just
eaten out of it izle, xyster, and thalassacon?
What did you imagine lies in wait anyway
at the end of a world whose sub-substance
is glaim, gleet, birdlime, slime, mucus, muck?
Forget about becoming emaciated. Think of the wren
and how little flesh is needed to make a song.
Didn't it seem somehow familiar when the nymph
split open and the mayfly struggled free
and flew and perched and then its own back
broke open and the imago, the true adult,
somersaulted out and took flight, seeking
the swarm, mouth-parts vestigial,
alimentary canal come to a stop,
a day or hour left to find the desired one?
Or when Casanova took up the platter
of linguine in squid's ink and slid the stuff
out the window, telling his startled companion,
'The perfected lover does not eat.'
As a child, didn't you find it calming to imagine
pinworms as some kind of tiny batons
giving cadence to the squeezes and releases
around the downward march of debris?
Didn't you glimpse in the monarchs
what seemed your own inner blazonry
flapping and gliding, in desire, in the middle air?
Weren't you reassured to think these flimsy
hinged beings, and then their offspring,
and then their offspring's offspring, could
navigate, working in shifts, all the way to Mexico,
to the exact plot, perhaps the very tree,
by tracing the flair of the bodies of ancestors
who fell in this same migration a year ago?
Doesn't it outdo the pleasures of the brilliant concert
to wake in the night and find ourselves
holding hands in our sleep



Marriage sanctifies sex, 
sex consummates marriage.
But why prefer sex before marriage, 
is there one or more reasons to consider? 

Virginity: 
Maybe its still men's quest, 
a priority test for him as the best.
So that the mating could be marked, 
as something worth experience to  take.

Sensuality: 
The best part in sex is sensuality, 
that each mate could get from sex.
The manner a partner performs well, 
is much desired by almost hot lovers.

Sexuality: 
Science could enhance state of sexuality, 
cosmetology can recreate the transformation.
By sex before marriage a person can discern, 
is the smart way to test the true lover's affinity.

Compatibility: 
Sexual compatibility excites much pleasure, 
Aside from love it is where both are in tune.
And to know what degree of zest it can set, 
through sex before marriage is the gauge. 

Why should I care for the men of thames 
Or the cheating waves of charter'd streams 
Or shrink at the little blasts of fear 
That the hireling blows into my ear 

Tho born on the cheating banks of Thames
Tho his waters bathed my infant limbs 
The Ohio shall wash his stains from me
I was born a slave but I go to be free. 


Why should I
Remember the dead? 
Why should I write
The words that are
Of no use? 
Why should I go
There when I know
There is no truth.
Still I am with you, 
And I love you, 
I know you are
The only person
Who can only
Comes to my rescue. 

I must sing
I know singing is life
Life is a song.

Go on singing
My dear I said myself
And you hear
You gave me this song. 

Why should I stay aloof
When I know I have nothing
And I am in no way with anything.
I am also  a witness like You
My dear, here, see me
And accord permission to express.
By expressing myself I might
Get freedom to some extent.
It is my innate consciousness
That I know You here as absolute truth. 




WHY should not old men be mad?
Some have known a likely lad
That had a sound fly-fisher's wrist
Turn to a drunken journalist;
A girl that knew all Dante once
Live to bear children to a dunce;
A Helen of social welfare dream,
Climb on a wagonette to scream.
Some think it a matter of course that chance
Should starve good men and bad advance,
That if their neighbours figured plain,
As though upon a lighted screen,
No single story would they find
Of an unbroken happy mind,
A finish worthy of the start.
Young men know nothing of this sort,
Observant old men know it well;
And when they know what old books tell
And that no better can be had,
Know why an old man should be mad. 

Why should one read poems
If it involves neither
One's welfare nor of the world.
Why should one read poems
If it is conducive neither
To the service of the family
Not to self-realization, 
The Ultimate Truth. 
Poems are also illusion
That attached to thoughts, 
To read poems is just to
Waste time and cause harm to
Oneself and it is a downfall
If one knows not ABC of life. 




So I slit my wrists
What do you care? 
So I'm ruining my life
I'm not in your hair.

I write depressing poems
about deep depression
and suicide attempts.
It's better than repression

I stay to myself, 
I hide my tears
and cover my cuts.
I'm the least of your fears.

So why do you care? 
Why do you watch me? 
Why do you stalk me? 
Leave me be! 


Im my own person
I'll do what I want
and if I kill myself
Your not the one I'll haunt

If you dont wanna hear.
Dont worry about me
I dont care if you care. 


Why the tears I shed? 
Hunger is around, 
I'm well fed.

Why the tears I shed? 
The fire has gone out, 
Warm is my bed.

Why the tears I shed? 
Love is without sense, 
On me lies her head.

Why the tears I shed? 
The living is on alms, 
Aplenty is my bread.

Why the tears I shed? 
Life seeks mercy, 
More blessed is the dead. 

From father to son

Why ugly? 

The news called me an
"Ugly fish"
It also says much more

"Also known as elfin sharks, "

"Evolution. "
Darwin called
"Behavioral, biological changes of character, "

I too was simple shark
Survival ordered me to adjust
In reply to changes in climate

That is all caused by you


'Why was Adam driven from the garden?'
The pupil asked his master. 'His heart was hardened
With images, a hundred bonds that clutter the earth
Chained Adam to the cycle of death following birth.
He was blind to this equation, living for something other
With his mortal body's cover his soul was shriven.
Like a moth shrivelled by the candle's flame,
Into history which taught mankind shame.
Since Adam had not given up his heart
For Adam in paradise where the only friend


Why was Cupid a boy,
And why a boy was he?
He should have been a girl,
For aught that I can see.

For he shoots with his bow,
And the girl shoots with her eye,
And they both are merry and glad,
And laugh when we do cry.

And to make Cupid a boy
Was the Cupid girl's mocking plan;
For a boy can't interpret the thing
Till he is become a man.

And then he's so pierc'd with cares,
And wounded with arrowy smarts,
That the whole business of his life
Is to pick out the heads of the darts.

'Twas the Greeks' love of war
Turn'd Love into a boy,
And woman into a statue of stone--
And away fled every joy. 

why was it me
What did I ever do
How could you do that to me
You left without a goodbye
Didn't you love me at all
Why was it me dad
Why did you hurt me so
all I ever wanted was for you to care
I guess thats a wish that will never come true



"To set this country free,
You'll have to whip 
And chase them o'er the sea


Oh, very well," 
"I'll do the best I can.
I'll slam and bang
And whip them to a man


Said Congress to George Washington:
"The people all complain;
Why don't you fight? You but retreat
And then retreat again

"
"That can't be helped," said Washington,
"As you will quite agree
When you see how the novelists
Have mixed up things for me


Said Congress to George Washington:
"Pray make your meaning clear

"
Said Washington: "Why, certainly --
But pray excuse this tear.
Of course we know," said Washington,
"The object of this war --
It is to furnish novelists
With patriotic lore


Said Congress to George Washington:
"Yes! yes! but pray proceed

"
Said Washington: "My part in it
Is difficult indeed,
For every hero in the books
Must sometime meet with me,
And every sweet-faced heroine
I must kiss gallantly


Said Congress to George Washington:
"But why must you retreat?"
Said Washington: "One moment, please,
My story to complete.
These hero-folk are scattered through
The whole United States;
At every little country town
A man or maiden waits


To Congress said George Washington:
"At Harlem I must be
On such a day to chat with one,
And then I'll have to flee
With haste to Jersey, there to meet
Another. Here's a list
Of sixty-seven heroes, and
There may be some I've missed


To Congress said George Washington:
"Since I must meet them all
(And if I don't you know how flat
The novels all will fall),
I cannot take much time to fight,
I must be on the run,
Or some historic novelist
Will surely be undone


Said Congress to George Washington:
"You are a noble man.
Your thoughtfulness is notable,
And we approve your plan;
A battle won pads very well
A novel that is thin,
But it is better to retreat
Than miss one man and win


Said Congress to George Washington:
"Kiss every pretty maid,
But do it in a courtly way
And in a manner staid --
And some day when your sword is sheathed
And all our banners furled,
A crop of novels will spring up
That shall appal the world





Why we drape in black funeral clothes
is not that black is the colour of death
neither is black the colour of evil - far be it! 
 
Adios, Dumega Hunnour T. 


"Papa, hede nyui, ya wor odwogbaa"! 

When a giant shady tree dies birds sing 
 not for the demise of an ample bosom
their mournful cries are always in blithe

so in our grief we learn new joyful dirges
for when a tree dies its stump grows back
that is why we must stifle our grief with joy
beneath our sombre faces lurk elation
as funerals become a celebration of life-
a life well spent to complete a full circle
to see a war veteran’s wardress adorned
with arrays of great-grandchildren as a legacy

when in funeral processions  we drape in black
it is not because it is the colour of death, far be it
the colour black is enigmatic like the magic of life 
and so black is required for all other colours 
to have depth and variants of hue – 
it's a dynamic trait that embodies ritual, 
dignity, force, reunion, strength –  
 it heals all wounds and misunderstanding
and above all, black is zero tolerance, and  endless
 
 life is a circle, never to be linear 
the present belongs to the living 
as the past is for the ancestors 
and the future is for the unborn –  
waiting for a turn to start another circle



your befitting burial is a festival of life
that spawn arrays of offspring to live on

the sun sets,  here comes the voyager at last
Papa, as you are going to that grand home
greet all the ancestors waiting to be reborn
greet Mama Adzinor, Freda Awusi Akwetey for me
please tell her that, her parting words are evergreen
like a tiny bell with an echoing chime in my heart
"my son, be like a tree planted by the rivers of water"


 

For Linda Foster


I
Because we used to have leaves
and on damp days
our muscles feel a tug,
painful now, from when roots
pulled us into the ground

and because our children believe
they can fly, an instinct retained
from when the bones in our arms
were shaped like zithers and broke
neatly under their feathers

and because before we had lungs
we knew how far it was to the bottom
as we floated open-eyed
like painted scarves through the scenery
of dreams, and because we awakened

and learned to speak

We sat by the fire in our caves,
and because we were poor, we made up a tale
about a treasure mountain
that would open only for us

and because we were always defeated,
we invented impossible riddles 
only we could solve,
monsters only we could kill,
women who could love no one else
and because we had survived
sisters and brothers, daughters and sons,
we discovered bones that rose
from the dark earth and sang
as white birds in the trees

Because the story of our life 
becomes our life

Because each of us tells
the same story
but tells it differently

and none of us tells it
the same way twice

Because grandmothers looking like spiders
want to enchant the children
and grandfathers need to convince us
what happened happened because of them

and though we listen only
haphazardly, with one ear,
we will begin our story
with the word and


We write to run, we write to fly, 
To soar above the world, 
We cry to feel, we cry to lie, 
To escape the hidden sword.

I pain to live, to breathe again, 
To heave in breaths of light, 
I gasp for air, I seek the men, 
Those few free who fight.

The sorrow slays, the sadness seeps, 
Into the bones of night, 
Where none but I, in solitude weeps, 
With the forsaken gift of sight.

We fall to flee, we fly to fall, 
To land amongst the clouds, 
Above the sobs, above the crowds, 
Where the Dream Realm welcomes all. 

In the dark is were I'll be
I can't stand being me
here I go around the bend
I want this to just end
I dont want these's thoughts any more
This is what goes on behind the door
I cry all night long
Everything is so very wrong
I think about dieing
Why why why
whats so very wrong with me
I hate this feeling deep inside me
Its so unfair 
why doesn't any one care
I'm hurting inside 
And you could care less
Why why why
whats so very wrong with me


Ay poets
Ay people 
Toronto, Canada
Continents, Africa, Asia

I am a camera, microscope
I am a typewriter, telescope

I have and I shall write
Write of leaves and grass
Write of gold, of bronze and brass
Write of the drop, sea-sun as mass

As a poet with grip
I am in charge and will
Write of hate, write of love
Write of snow and the cloud
Write of peace and the wars

Oh I shall and I will
Write of breast
From being a pin-sized
To chestnut and walnut
All the way to the time
That you liked, so did I
And the time that a child
Sucks the milk for the life

I shall leave what I write
For the time as the guide
"This is life in our time.




"He lies wide eyed.

The opaque stream reflects no sky
betrays no emotions
nothing is impressed on the canvas anymore.

‘Wide eyed’
that’s how he was described by all
as he gave everything a riveting look
stopped on the way of his routine chores
lost in his own wandering thoughts
stealing and storing on those orifice
the wonders that often pass as mundane
letting not the smallest bit to escape
like a crazy collector on a wild run of filling his scrapbook.


He lies wide eyed.

His unblinking eyes still in awe of the stored marvels
and silently pleading the approaching fingers
not to shut them

Wide lies Australia! The seas that surround her 
Flow for her unity – all states in one. 
Never has Custom nor Tyranny bound her – 
Never was conquest so peacefully won. 
Fair lies Australia! with all things within her 
Meet for a Nation, the greatest to be: 
Free to the White Man to woo and to win her: 
Those who'd be happy and those who'd be free. 

Free to live fully and free to live cleanly, 
Free to give learning to daughter and son; 
Free to act nobly but not to act meanly, 
Free to forget what the old lands had done. 
Free to be Brothers! Our hymn and our sermon 
To keep for the White World the balance of Power, 
Welcoming all, be they British or German, 
All come to help us – we'll wait for the hour. 

Out in the West where the flood-water gathers – 
Out in the drought on the sand desert lone – 
Went the brave English and brave foreign fathers 
Fearlessly facing the fearful unknown. 
Gemmed with their names lies the great past behind us. 
Dark lie the storm clouds before us today, 
Let us so live the future shall find us 
Facing the danger as dauntless as they. 



A Man, Who, 
Looks for beautiful wife
Never switch off lights
In the Night, 
If he is wise.

A Man, Who
Switch off lights 
In the night, Never 
Looks for beautiful wife, 
If he is wise. 

For years
Years and years and years
He lived in Asia
A master.  (Somehow)  
Much he did not write 
But to soldiers "Stand-up"
(As patriot, nationalist)  
For the ‘Great War’
But for Wigan
(Poor of the higher race)  
And against ‘The others’
He became trumpet. 
Blown voice to space. 

What a shame.

Enchanted Wil-O-The Wisp Wanderer
    You cannot escape his sea-blue
                           Eyes  View
For set in water they are
    Upon this beautiful form
                            Of  You
Cladden In White Chantilly Lace
     A flowing gown of floral crochet
But somewhat sheer in certain light
     Seen in his eye near the bay
You walk along the sands O' time
     Upon the shorelines 
                          Passing  Scene
O' enchanted Wil-O-The-Wisp Wanderer
     You are the woman of his dreams
His sea of blue eyes come calling
     Beckoning you away from the shore
Perhaps, anew, A Mermaid borne
     And a Wil -O- The- Wisp Wanderer
                          No   More


There's a breathless hush on the freeway tonight
Beyond the ledges of concrete
restaurants fall into dreams
with candlelight couples
Lost Alexandria still burns
in a billion lightbulbs
Lives cross lives
idling at stoplights
Beyond the cloverleaf turnoffs
'Souls eat souls in the general emptiness'
A piano concerto comes out a kitchen window
A yogi speaks at Ojai
'It's all taking pace in one mind'
On the lawn among the trees
lovers are listening
for the master to tell them they are one
with the universe
Eyes smell flowers and become them
There's a deathless hush
on the freeway tonight
as a Pacific tidal wave a mile high
sweeps in
Los Angeles breathes its last gas
and sinks into the sea like the Titanic all lights lit
Nine minutes later Willa Cather's Nebraska
sinks with it
The sea comes over in Utah
Mormon tabernacles washed away like barnacles
Coyotes are confounded & swim nowhere
An orchestra onstage in Omaha
keeps on playing Handel's Water Music
Horns fill with water
ans bass players float away on their instruments
clutching them like lovers horizontal
Chicago's Loop becomes a rollercoaster
Skyscrapers filled like water glasses
Great Lakes mixed with Buddhist brine
Great Books watered down in Evanston
Beau Fleuve of Buffalo suddenly become salt
Manhatten Island swept clean in sixteen seconds
buried masts of Amsterdam arise
as the great wave sweeps on Eastward
to wash away over-age Camembert Europe
manhatta steaming in sea-vines
the washed land awakes again to wilderness
the only sound a vast thrumming of crickets
a cry of seabirds high over
in empty eternity
as the Hudson retakes its thickets
and Indians reclaim their canoes


Once ignited
Both these
Inherently, are capable of spreading themselves


Beautiful
In wild
Awful 
In vase


You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes, 
over the prairies and the deep trees, 
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in  the clean blue air, 
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, 
the world offers itself to your imagination, 
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting-
over and over announcing your place
In the family of things. 

What tree may not the fig be gathered from? 
The grape may not be gathered from the birch?
It's all you know the grape, or know the birch.
As a girl gathered from the birch myself
Equally with my weight in grapes, one autumn,
I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of.
I was born, I suppose, like anyone,
And grew to be a little boyish girl
My brother could not always leave at home.
But that beginning was wiped out in fear
The day I swung suspended with the grapes,
And was come after like Eurydice
And brought down safely from the upper regions;
And the life I live now's an extra life
I can waste as I please on whom I please.
So if you see me celebrate two birthdays,
And give myself out of two different ages,
One of them five years younger than I look-

One day my brother led me to a glade
Where a white birch he knew of stood alone,
Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves,
And heavy on her heavy hair behind,
Against her neck, an ornament of grapes.
Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last year.
One bunch of them, and there began to be
Bunches all round me growing in white birches,
The way they grew round Leif the Lucky's German;
Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though,
As the moon used to seem when I was younger,
And only freely to be had for climbing.
My brother did the climbing; and at first
Threw me down grapes to miss and scatter
And have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack;
Which gave him some time to himself to eat,
But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed.
So then, to make me wholly self-supporting,
He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earth
And put it in my hands to pick my own grapes.
'Here, take a tree-top, I'll get down another.
Hold on with all your might when I let go.'
I said I had the tree. It wasn't true.
The opposite was true. The tree had me.
The minute it was left with me alone
It caught me up as if I were the fish
And it the fishpole. So I was translated
To loud cries from my brother of 'Let go!
Don't you know anything, you girl? Let go!'
But I, with something of the baby grip
Acquired ancestrally in just such trees
When wilder mothers than our wildest now
Hung babies out on branches by the hands
To dry or wash or tan, I don't know which,
(You'll have to ask an evolutionist)-
I held on uncomplainingly for life.
My brother tried to make me laugh to help me.
'What are you doing up there in those grapes?
Don't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you.
I mean, they won't pick you if you don't them.'
Much danger of my picking anything!
By that time I was pretty well reduced
To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.
'Now you know how it feels,' my brother said,
'To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,
That when it thinks it has escaped the fox
By growing where it shouldn't-on a birch,
Where a fox wouldn't think to look for it-
And if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it-
Just then come you and I to gather it.
Only you have the advantage of the grapes
In one way: you have one more stem to cling by,
And promise more resistance to the picker.'

One by one I lost off my hat and shoes,
And still I clung. I let my head fall back,
And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears
Against my brother's nonsense; 'Drop,' he said,
'I'll catch you in my arms. It isn't far.'
(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)
'Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down.'
Grim silence on my part as I sank lower,
My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.
'Why, if she isn't serious about it!
Hold tight awhile till I think what to do.
I'll bend the tree down and let you down by it.'
I don't know much about the letting down;
But once I felt ground with my stocking feet
And the world came revolving back to me,
I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,
Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off.
My brother said: 'Don't you weigh anything?
Try to weigh something next time, so you won't
Be run off with by birch trees into space.'


It wasn't my not weighing anything
So much as my not knowing anything-
My brother had been nearer right before.
I had not taken the first step in knowledge;
I had not learned to let go with the hands,
As still I have not learned to with the heart,
And have no wish to with the heart-nor need,
That I can see. The mind-is not the heart.
I may yet live, as I know others live,
To wish in vain to let go with the mind-
Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells me
That I need learn to let go with the heart. 


You led me to the water
But you wouldn't let me drink

I stumbled over many fine
Dead and thirsty horses
Looking at your lovely hands
Cherishing the choke


I'm leaving all the seas to you
So you can wash your hands


Till dies down the music in our ears
Come let’s go back to the yesteryears
To those beaches of youth’s wild hunt
Run again with the wind and play truant.
Come let’s go get one more hold
On those duckback years that couldn’t make us old
Fly with them to where we dreamed to reach
The realm of youth’s sweated whiff adrift in saline beach.
Come let’s go back and ride the breaking waves
Dig out love’s fossil that our heart still craves
Retrace our imprints etched on the sandy shore
Till the music dies down and in our ears plays no more. 


What reason justifies our continuing existence daily? What power powers the energy of the Great old Sun of Earth to arise and shine bright daily? What keeps the waves of the seas from breaking it's bounds and disobey like everyone else? Daily? My body is old and weary of stress, the child that dwells within me is young and wild searching for wild adventure. I'm tired on the outside but restless desperation eats me from within. They say that someday when dawn sleep past her wake and the cheerful morning sun in his path is late to you awake. One can hear voices of long dead ones they knew some past days. 

The darkness is cold and rather unusually very long when your dawn awaits, then the grim reaper awakes, with his dreaded toy. I hear  voices of transiting souls of sheol, whisper saying lo, When it comes you begin to think like a boy, behold, Old lonely heart within the chest dies out, consumed by its unwholesome carnal desires. Suddenly like a tree in a storm, the steadfast winds of adversity blows then ur hidden roots shall be discovered. Alas this primitive pottery called body, suffers a crack when the golden bowls of clay tilts after the silver chord breaks above the spinal chord. Then the child(soul)     within leaks like water thru a broken cistern. 


I found answers by Wisdoms' counsel that LOVE rose the sun daily and powers it! I found LOVE to be the force that blocked the waves from flooding civilization! Thus confused as i am I found freedom in LOVE


Blandly mother 
takes him strolling 
by railroad and by river 
-he's the son of the absconded 
hot rod angel- 
and he imagines cars 
and rides them in his dreams, 

so lonely growing up among 
the imaginary automobiles 
and dead souls of Tarrytown 

to create 
out of his own imagination 
the beauty of his wild 
forebears-a mythology 
he cannot inherit. 

Will he later hallucinate 
his gods? Waking 
among mysteries with 
an insane gleam 
of recollection? 

The recognition- 
something so rare 
in his soul, 
met only in dreams 
-nostalgias 
of another life. 

A question of the soul. 
And the injured 
losing their injury 
in their innocence 
-a cock, a cross, 
an excellence of love. 

And the father grieves 
in flophouse 
complexities of memory 
a thousand miles 
away, unknowing 
of the unexpected 
youthful stranger 
bumming toward his door.





When the world turns completely upside down 
You say we'll emigrate to the Eastern Shore 
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore; 
We'll live among wild peach trees, miles from town, 
You'll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown 
Homespun, dyed butternut's dark gold colour. 
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor, 
We'll swim in milk and honey till we drown.

The winter will be short, the summer long, 
The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot, 
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong; 
All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all. 
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall 
Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.

The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass 
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold. 
The misted early mornings will be cold; 
The little puddles will be roofed with glass. 
The sun, which burns from copper into brass, 
Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold 
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold 
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.

Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover; 
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year; 
The spring begins before the winter's over. 
By February you may find the skins 
Of garter snakes and water moccasins 
Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.

When April pours the colours of a shell 
Upon the hills, when every little creek 
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake 
In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell, 
When strawberries go begging, and the sleek 
Blue plums lie open to the blackbird's beak, 
We shall live well -- we shall live very well.

The months between the cherries and the peaches 
Are brimming cornucopias which spill 
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black; 
Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches 
We'll trample bright persimmons, while you kill 
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.

Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones 
There's something in this richness that I hate. 
I love the look, austere, immaculate, 
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones. 
There's something in my very blood that owns 
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate, 
A thread of water, churned to milky spate 
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray, 
Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves; 
That spring, briefer than apple-blossom's breath, 
Summer, so much too beautiful to stay, 
Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves, 
And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death. 

Wild roses in the old garden 
of the broken hearted; 
by the old castle are ancient secrets
you could always see the gaze of pains
deep within their minds of that time, 
No one says a word 
they just walk on by 
legends of gloom will be in every dream
that will make the heart bleed 
the mind wish it has never known 
how this ancient sorry goes 
wild roses of angel dust 
casting spells on all who dreams.
 




Rune of passion when holds the mystery
sympathy never dries empty by the reeks
eloquence of love parades across  the bliss
the reason never seems to falter by the belief

trust still reels through the hidden dream
gleaming the pearl of  blue emblazoned
walks follows the path true by repentance 
enlightened by warmth as leaf rejoices in green  

silence yet blazes the mystery of love in hide
moon still whispers the heart by the grin deep
hope mingles into the blue when emancipated 
world wordless smiles faster by the redemption

yet the hours of the dark and light as all we need
clouds smacks of rain as the path of deliverance
love yet never follows foot prints of narrow endings
desire meanders into the wild streams by the eternity


Wild Water

Look at the left and right, looks same
Two strings come and go straight

Leisure heart elegantly floated outside the floating clouds
Elegant interest between wild water ups and downs



Noon

tall gunmen walking slowly towards each other down Mathew St.


And then he grabbed her 
And then 
He tied her up
And then
He lit the fuse to the dynamite
And then
And then

William H. Bonney alias Billy the Kid hitches his horse to a parking meter strides through the swing doors into Yates Wine Lodge. Barmaids slowly back away from the counter. Drunks rush out into Charlotte Street. He drinks a glass of Aussie White and strides out, silent as he came.


POEM FOR BLACK BART TO LEAVE BEHIND ON A STAGE COACH

I hope you ladies ain't afraid Of the wicked man who made this raid But I'm like nature quick and cruel Believe me, gals, I need them jewels.




      To Siegfried Sassoon 


My arms have mutinied against me -- brutes!
My fingers fidget like ten idle brats,
My back's been stiff for hours, damned hours.
Death never gives his squad a Stand-at-ease.
I can't read.  There:  it's no use.  Take your book.
A short life and a merry one, my buck!
We said we'd hate to grow dead old.  But now,
Not to live old seems awful:  not to renew
My boyhood with my boys, and teach 'em hitting,
Shooting and hunting, -- all the arts of hurting!
-- Well, that's what I learnt.  That, and making money.
Your fifty years in store seem none too many;
To help myself to this good air of yours!
One Spring!  Is one too hard to spare?  Too long?
Spring air would find its own way to my lung,
And grow me legs as quick as lilac-shoots. 

Yes, there's the orderly.  He'll change the sheets
When I'm lugged out, oh, couldn't I do that?
Here in this coffin of a bed, I've thought
I'd like to kneel and sweep his floors for ever, --
And ask no nights off when the bustle's over,
For I'd enjoy the dirt; who's prejudiced
Against a grimed hand when his own's quite dust, --
Less live than specks that in the sun-shafts turn?
Dear dust, -- in rooms, on roads, on faces' tan!
I'd love to be a sweep's boy, black as Town;
Yes, or a muckman.  Must I be his load?
A flea would do.  If one chap wasn't bloody,
Or went stone-cold, I'd find another body. 

Which I shan't manage now.  Unless it's yours.
I shall stay in you, friend, for some few hours.
You'll feel my heavy spirit chill your chest,
And climb your throat on sobs, until it's chased
On sighs, and wiped from off your lips by wind. 

I think on your rich breathing, brother, I'll be weaned
To do without what blood remained me from my wound.

madalam
chenda, idakka, 
And she danced through 
these silences of the brutalities.
Her angst burst out 
She is in the form of another male now
through that dark and light clouds
she dance through 
the Lightning in the crimson sky 
in the light of Kalivilakku
her face brighten 
her face brunt in saffron-
saffron-
She becomes the saffron faced Kathakali dancer
In her female strength she becomes male-
She becomes the Shiva 
the agni in her burns 
her face in red
colour of vermillion flows out..
red-
She becomes the red faced Kathakali dancer
And the devil in her worked too
In the war for peace 
in the spirit of demonic Durga 
Drunk in the blood of impurities
The colour of vermillion petrify
She becomes Shiva gulping down the vish 
Danced still amidst devils
Dance in taalam of the drums
Till another sun appears
Tearing through these darkness
black
A hamsasya
A godly everythings evolve out of her
She runs towards the green room 
Reddened in menstruating blood
She sighs
Again run 
in the beats of mridangum
run in male form and dance
with that strength to gulp down pain
She is burnt like sita 
in the agni of another war
The yellow fire becomes her Saree
Sheltering her from human gluttony
yellow
She becomes the yellow faced Kathakali dancer in woman
still dance on the fire 
The dancing man is the dancing wild woman 
And the wild woman is the Kathakali dancer
Till the motherness in her embrace 
the maness and womaness 
She becomes all and everything
Sathwika 
the hero
Kathi 
the villain
A complete female 
A beautiful woman is born 
And gives birth to a pious earth
And 
A motherly man protects the earth-
Surrounded by Human saints 

The dancing man is the dancing wild woman 
And the wild woman is the Kathakali dancer


And in the process of putrefaction-
And in the process of petrifaction-
Destruction, Devils and Death through these darkness 
Melts into this ocean of one another..
Then 
she becomes the universe of love and only love-
And the dancing man was the dancing wild woman
And the wild woman the Kathakali dancer


Life is love and love is life 
I hear it from every poet of this world 
But life is not there 
Until you are capable being wild 
No poet is born 
Until a wilderness is found in a poem 
This wilderness makes a song a true song 
A dance an actual dance 
Without wilderness in love 
Life does not get freedom 
And without freedom in love 
No life at all 
All rules and retractions are nothing but a boundary 
Limiting your life, your love, your joy and your creativity. 


Wilderness budded, wind swept past

Far enough from the reality of existence, 
Alone thee grows happy seeing sunlight everyday.
As rain falls thee calls it blessing from heaven.
Few learned thee appreciate too bounty.
Morning to night time thee looks upon the sky.
Thee loves to stare thing glowing at the dark sky.


Thousands of days past, thee learned to wonder.
Learned many things and starts to grow bigger.
Leaves and branches are harder and thicker.
As wind, heavy rains and even storm strikes, 
thee wounded and thee cries, but still stand.
Thee don't know why. But thee holds. 


With a bright day, big storm came unexpectedly.
Fears surround and noise everywhere.
Thee branches break, leaves fallen and its so dim.
Roots thee had no damage but had terrible pain.
Thee stood, close thee eyes and thee prays.
Thee holds until storms passes thee way.


Next day; after the big storm, Thee awakes.
With the sharp rays came from the sun, 
Pain.  

thee alone cries aloud for help.
Little birds come and dig-up thee branches.
Give thee water and sing thee not to surrender.
Thee got strength and fight again.


Thee have been brave and thankful for everything.
Thee find friends and thee is happy.
But thee were sometimes scared and hopeless. 
Thee got nothing to be proud and thee is small.
One day, thee saw beautiful butterfly at nearby.
Often it only flies far from thee each day.


For thee keeps wondering why, thee found out! 
Flowers.  

oh but thee had nothing even one.
Thee wishes everyday to find flower at thee branch.
Every night thee talks with the stars and hoping it heard.
Every night thee watches that glowing objects above.
Until thee didn't notice, thee was so into the certain star.



Each day, thee face the world with full of inspiration.
Do nothing except to be the best in every way.
For thee believes, thee can reach the star.
Thee blooms, branches become stronger. Leaves are greener.
One day thee realizes, thee had flowers and fragrance.
There are colorful butterfly flying beside thee.


Thee is too happy to see changes oneself.
But thee longs that the star could notice from far.
Every night thee wondered for same star.
Though its impossible, thee wishes to reach it.
Thee promise, thee stays a wild flower with no name.
Until the star fall and give thee name


for my long flight away from home for almost a decade now

He is alone, unhearted
self-exploring, self-discovering
self-searching, near to the frontier
range of aged time

Hi is young by mind
wildhearted, self-motivating
near to the farthest
corner of the city wilderness

He is ' I ', he is ' me '
he has crossed continent beyond
edges of ' my ' inner space

He has unlocked the chain
fettering on his flesh
being self-prisoned by self-convicted
guilt of a crime beyond arraignment
of not knowing oneself

He is refreshing with full humiliation
from the wildhearted disposition

He is now reconciling with himself
myself
for a dramatic flight back home
soon


Birds and possums, 
coons and squirrels
frequent my wife’s garden.

Dawn to dusk I spy on them
from an upstairs window
next to my computer.

They remind me of the city
poor foraging in Dumpsters.
This morning a coon dispatched

a possum that had 
frightened away two feral cats 
I feed every day at a. m. 


When I went out on the deck
and waved my arms to dispatch
the coon, he sat on his rump

and stared at me with a glare
I saw years ago in the eyes
of a girl who became a nun. 

She is still a nun today. 
She said cut it out back then.
As did the coon today. 


Hunter at night and a sleeper by day
A lonely coyote pounces on its prey
An old gray bat is zooming all around
Some sly foxes going out on the town

Hyenas laughing and fighting for the dead
Animals scurrying eyes filled with dread
A ferocious tiger goes out on the prowl
Sounds are echoing from a screeching owl

Lions roar cause they're king of the jungle
Catching their food is without any bungle
Noisy baboons hung freely from the trees
Disturbing the hives of sweet honeybees

Night is the time for some wildlife flings
Songs breaks forth as the cuckoo bird sings
A wide eyed cougar searching for its catch
Crossed path with a bear and met its match

Leopards sleeping or basking out in the sun
Waiting for the chance to make the nights run
A pumas large glaring eyes lights up the dark
Searching and crouching then leaps on its mark

Wildcats anxiously stalking some weary deers
Celebrating their catch without any kind of fears
A pack of hungry wolves hovering over their kill
Beware of dangers for night life is never still




(Deserters)
        There is a world outside the one you know,
              To which for curiousness 'Ell can't compare--
         It is the place where "wilful-missings" go,
            As we can testify, for we are there.

        You may 'ave read a bullet laid us low,
           That we was gathered in "with reverent care"
         And buried proper.   But it was not so,
           As we can testify --for we are there!


They can't be certain--faces alter so
  After the old aasvogel 'ad 'is share.
The uniform's the mark by which they go--
  And--ain't it odd?--the one we best can spare.

We might 'ave seen our chance to cut the show--
  Name, number, record, an 'begin elsewhere--
Leaven'' some not too late-lamented foe
  One funeral-private-British-for 'is share.

We may 'ave took it yonder in the Low
  Bush-veldt that sends men stragglin' 'unaware
Among the Kaffirs, till their columns go,
  An 'they are left past call or count or care.

We might 'ave been your lovers long ago,
  'Usbands or children--comfort or despair.
Our death (an' burial) settles all we owe,
  An' why we done it is our own affair.

Marry again, and we will not say no,
  Nor come to barstardise the kids you bear.
Wait on in 'ope--you've all your life below
  Before you'll ever 'ear us on the stair.

There is no need to give our reasons, though
  Gawd knows we all 'ad reasons which were fair;
But other people might not judge 'em so--
  And now it doesn't matter what they were.

What man can weigh or size another's woe:
  There are some things too bitter 'ard to bear.
Suffice it we 'ave finished--Domino!

  As we can testify, for we are there,
In the side-world where "wilful-missings " go.‘


’Will’’ makes a difference 
Between you and the rest - - 
When you will be taken into account 
The rest will go scot free


-I don't believe I will make it anymore
I don't really care now
It hurts so bad
I am so numb
I don't believe I will get better
All I am is ever nice
I'm tired of getting used
I'm tired of not getting noticed
I am so tired of sitting here alone
waiting
just wondering
if anyone will



Mist and clouds enveloped the Luoyang City
Saw you off far away by degrees in the flying boat
Think of the month of next year the peaches and plums in bloom
I’ll fete you on the bateau bridge in red flowers and green willows


Will Meet Again


A chance encounter met with a misfortune	once
After the vicissitudes, we will meet again
Ancient trees tower to the skies, listen to the Buddha's words
Pine shadows ask road, understand Zen


Your name is home of love; 
The porch greets
With Jasmine fragrance ; 
My thirst is trapped within
A tender coconut tree; 
Dreams are painted around the shelves
And freeze in ornate toys, 
My taste possesses warmth  
From the stove in the kitchen. 
The darkness and loneliness
Shared not only in bed
But Counting the stars too.
I could touch the 
Spilling water from the well.
Despite all, 
The WILL of the house is 
Not with me



How nice was to see the love of the pigeon! 
How tasty was the fruits of every season! 

Now the nature is not fresh but full of poison 
The earth has lost its beauty and acts like a prison.

Were the civilizations destroyed without any reason? 
Lots of better sense has been wasted out in the horizon! 

How much love still left to throw in the ocean? 
How much more blood will suck the religion? 

How long one has to endure the mental pollution! 
How long the blatant lie will tolerate the great sun! 

What punishments wait for us for the heinous treason? 
Will people still continue to sabotage their own mission?

One by one 
They were all called 

Including the vast ocean 
And the mighty hill 

They all refused 
To take will 

Will took man 
Or man took will 

That’s not the question 
But this tiny creature, man 

Became brave and intelligent 
With all self respects  

Took all the responsibilities 
Now full of self pride 

Full of proud 
Being a will powered machine 

Now he can show the door 
To the sun 

Oceans serve him 
He can raise finger against the moon 

The whole world stands aside
To let him pass 

As he knows
 Where he is going


will she ever notice me, 
does she notice i exist, 
would she ever love me, 
i gave her flowers once, 
she gave them to her mum, 
man i felt like such a loser, 
i thought i had found the one, 
the girl i am meant to be with, 
the girl that i really love, 
to me she is a vision, 
of beauty from above, 
the first time i ever saw her, 
i thought, 
shit, 
god has sent an angel, 
to condemn me for a sin, 
but then i realised, 
that she's mortal, 
and beautiful, 
i love her, 
but that was long ago, 
and i've met her again, 
and i still wonder if she notices me, 
because i love her. 


She sits there alone wondering why
Hoping she don't break down and cry
The love she has for him is ever so strong
Being without him feels so wrong
Nothing in life is ever so fair
All she wants is for him to care
As the story keeps on playing
As people keep on saying
She keeps on asking her self 'Does he love me? '
will she be able to wait forever to see


She sits by the window motionless
Looking at the sky getting darker
Inside her a sea swells, tides of memories
Beat her heart, the only keepsake she has

Like a thick shelled oyster, tightly spliced
He sealed his heart to her barring entry
She wonders what currents flow through his sinews? 
And what eddies churn and gyrate within? 

Do the thoughts of their love linger there? 
Does her image, to his memory ever return? 
Does he recall how they stood silent beneath the stars? 
How they then built an epoch in a glance! 

Once life moved with lilting measure
From goblets, they quaffed the bubbling liquid
Everyday a new song was thrummed upon life's harp
What passion, what youth, what thrill they shared then

They so loved  as no one had ever loved
Like a phantom she followed him behind
To him alone her heart, as offering she gave
Never suspected any force to tear them apart

But how Fate waited swift to smite
And how they had to part in anguish
Toppling down the sand castles they built 
Leaving a heap of debris behind


Will he once more open his heart? 
Will she again find entry and nest within? 
Will she be able to douse her smouldering pain? 
In her dark hours, she sees a star twinkling far


In trying to find the perfect words
to describe how I feel about you, 
I forgot to listen.
In trying to write the perfect lines, 
I borrowed your pen, 
But I forgot to touch your hand.
In trying to envision a future for us, 
I borrowed your glasses, 
But I forgot to look in your eyes.
In trying to buy you the perfect gift, 
I borrowed a Rand, 
But I forgot to be with you.
In trying to be the perfect gentleman, 
I borrowed a suit, 
but I forgot to be me, 
I'm sorry.

Now I'm trying to make it right, 
And I borrow your time; 
And this time, 
I will not forget to give it back.
I will forget about moving my lips
and try to kiss you.
I will forget my fancy lines
and try to be true.
I will forget about tomorrow, 
And focuss on you now.
I will forget about appearances, 
and try to be authentic.
I might even forget how to forget, 
And try to remember you.
But baby, if you try to change a man, 
well then
You can just forget about it. 


I write this letter
Hoping times will be better
When this war
Is through.
I'm a Tan-skinned Yank
Driving a tank.
I ask, WILL V-DAY
BE ME-DAY, TOO?

I wear a U. S. uniform.
I've done the enemy much harm,
I've driven back
The Germans and the Japs,
From Burma to the Rhine.
On every battle line,
I've dropped defeat
Into the Fascists' laps.

I am a Negro American
Out to defend my land
Army, Navy, Air Corps--
I am there.
I take munitions through,
I fight--or stevedore, too.
I face death the same as you do 
Everywhere.

I've seen my buddy lying
Where he fell.
I've watched him dying
I promised him that I would try
To make our land a land
Where his son could be a man--
And there'd be no Jim Crow birds
Left in our sky.

So this is what I want to know:
When we see Victory's glow,
Will you still let old Jim Crow
Hold me back?
When all those foreign folks who've waited--
Italians, Chinese, Danes--are liberated.
Will I still be ill-fated
Because I'm black?

Here in my own, my native land,
Will the Jim Crow laws still stand?
Will Dixie lynch me still
When I return?
Or will you comrades in arms
From the factories and the farms,
Have learned what this war
Was fought for us to learn?

When I take off my uniform,
Will I be safe from harm--
Or will you do me
As the Germans did the Jews?
When I've helped this world to save,
Shall I still be color's slave?
Or will Victory change
Your antiquated views?

You can't say I didn't fight
To smash the Fascists' might.
You can't say I wasn't with you
in each battle.
As a soldier, and a friend.
When this war comes to an end,
Will you herd me in a Jim Crow car
Like cattle?

Or will you stand up like a man
At home and take your stand
For Democracy?
That's all I ask of you.
When we lay the guns away
To celebrate
Our Victory Day
WILL V-DAY BE ME-DAY, TOO?
That's what I want to know.


Will you lay down beside me? 
Will you promise me the moon? 
Will you caress my needy skin? 
Will come to me very soon? 
Will you gently take me
To another place-another time? 
And will you then embrace
This shattered heart of mine? 
Will you tenderly undress me? 
And run your fingers everywhere? 
Will you touch my longing breasts
And remove my hidden despair? 
Will you take me totally in? 
Enter you as one into me? 
Removing all doubts or questions
Of: ' If this was meant to be'
Will you truly  promise 
To return here for more? 
Raising hopes of my loving you
Who my heart completely adores


The rising sun has yet to glow
In his resplendent glory, 
The moon has not even begun her descent
But I’m here on the shore, 
Thinking about you, 
Coz its only you
That I can think of.

Through all the sorrows and pain
You will  be by my side, 
You said --You will be true-
That’s a promise you said, 
Till the sun loses his lustre 
 and the moon her glow.

Do you know how much I love you, 
You will never understand, 
Ill be there till eternity, 
YOU JUST HOLD MY HAND
AND LEAD ME ON


Will you? 


The light of the moon 
Appears more beautiful  

Then the grasses I see 
More green than before 

 mangoes  taste  sweeter
the heaven above I look   wider 

below I listen  the river 
flows more swiftly  with a song  murmur

the wind I feel 
more soothing and cooler 

though humidity is high atmosphere is dry 
could you tell me why? 
 
Look  how flowers laugh 
The road becomes cool enough 

To see us hand in hand jollier 
 side by side happier 

And they all promise to be  happier 
If you promise to walk with me like this forever.


Will you

Nearby you seem 

Now when I reach out and feel 

Smiles toss and tumble

Scatter all over me

Inhibition sets in way 

Discouraged you are not

Although many fail 

Realities scornfully say

How long you'd stay? ? 

Suppressing that thought you look away

Zeroing in that blurring endless ray of fate

Ask you shall I? 

Will you be there to heal? 

The wounds that have lifted their veils  

Will you be there? 

To ease the ever increasing pain

Will you be there? 

Or perhaps scuttle off to an event horizon 

Covering your sensibilities with fingers of sanity


Will you dance with me again? 
Like we danced beneath the stars
Swaying in each others arms
To the music of a thousand guitars.

Will you dance with me again? 
Like we danced the first time around
When breaths mingled and cheeks caressed
And all we heard was the heartbeat loud.

Will you dance with me again? 
Like we did when we kissed
Gently first, and then with passion
When two lives got woven into one.

Will you dance with me again? 
Just this one last time
For I want to feel loved
Before the end of lifetime! 


Will you still love me when I grow old
When life's problems have taken their toll
With secrets uncovered and tales unfold
From this day forward to have and to hold

We cannot tell how our life is going to be
Some things that are hidden from you and me
Bound together by love and tied like a knot
Two perfect individuals is what we are not

I'll still see your shadow when eyes grow dim
Feel your tender touch at each and every whim
Basking in the warmth of your gentle embrace
Loving you ever none can never take your place


The light of the moon 
The rain of the cloud 
The stars from the sky 
The green of the hill
The music of the river 
The roaring of the ocean 
One by one the whole earth
Just give me a little place in your heart 
And remember me  when I will depart. 


Stay the night with me? 
You ask 'what's the catch'
I say ' There's strings.  Their just not attached, '
Just lie in my arms.  I need nothing more, 
Please me mentally.  that's all I need, 
Stimulating conversations? perhaps Poetry to read? 
Physicality is lovely.  but with you there's more
Your the only person this dead heart beats for. 


White surf dances up
curtsies to the beach and
dances back again
again and again and again

He came to the desert of London town 
Gray miles long; 
He wandered up and he wandered down, 
Singing a quiet song. 

He came to the desert of London town, 
Mirk miles broad; 
He wandered up and he wandered down, 

There were thousands and thousands of human kind 
In this desert of brick and stone; 
But some were deaf and some were blind, 
And he was there alone. 

At length the good hour came; he died 
As he had lived, alone. 
He was not missed from the desert wide; 
Perhaps he was found at the throne. 


THIS is the place. Even here the dauntless soul,
The unflinching hand, wrought on; till in that nook,
As on that very bed, his life partook
New birth, and passed. Yon river's dusky shoal,
Whereto the close-built coiling lanes unroll,
Faced his work-window, whence his eyes would stare,
Thought-wandering, unto nought that met them there,
But to the unfettered irreversible goal.
This cupboard, Holy of Holies, held the cloud
Of his soul writ and limned; this other one,
His true wife's charge, full oft to their abode
Yielded for daily bread the martyr's stone,
Ere yet their food might be that Bread alone


anger
I told my wrath
my wrath did end

anger
I told it not
my wrath did grow.

anger
I water it in fears
and my tears

anger
i sun it with smiles
and soft deceitful wiles

anger
it grows till it
bores an apple bright

my foe beholds it shine.
and knows
it is mine

anger my garden steals
when the night
veils the pole


A scientist is suppose to do 
A scientific work 
And develops science 
For the betterment of mankind 

His contribution is treasured 
And venerated by all 
As he pushes up our knowledge 
On matter and life 
By leaving a legacy of 
Much better method and technique 


A poet is not in any way less 
If he is like William Blake 
And develops the branch of poetry 
Like a branch of science 

His method and technique 
Push up the art of writing poetry to a height
Equal to the invention of nuclear energy 
By the scientists  

To have a chain of reactions 
You need not any nuclear materials 
As his poetry is enough to set your mind 
To work like a reactor 

Inventions in the craft of writing poetry 
Centuries after centuries 
What mankind fails to achieve
In laboratories of art he invented those 
Like a scientist.

Blessed be the man that spares these stones,
And cursed be he that moves my bones. 


the world's a stage
for the men and women
exits and entrances

the infant
in the nurse's arms

.  the whinning schoolboy
creep like snail
unwilling to school

the lover 
sighing a furnace of ballad 
to his loving mistress

a soldier
full of strange oaths and 
bearded like the pard

the justice
in fair round belly 
with good capon lined

the sixth age shifts
in the lean and slippered 
pantaloon

his youthful nose
shrunk shank, his big manly voice
a childish treble

last scene
a second childishness
sans teeth, sans eyes, sans everything. 


And I grew up in patterned tranquillity, 
In the cool nursery of the young century. 
And the voice of man was not dear to me, 
But the voice of the wind I could understand. 
But best of all the silver willow. 
And obligingly, it lived 
With me all my life; it's weeping branches 
Fanned my insomnia with dreams. 
And strange!--I outlived it. 
There the stump stands; with strange voices 
Other willows are conversing 
Under our, under those skies. 
And I am silent.  

As if a brother had died.


It is a willow when summer is over,
a willow by the river
from which no leaf has fallen nor
bitten by the sun
turned orange or crimson.
The leaves cling and grow paler,
swing and grow paler
over the swirling waters of the river
as if loth to let go,
they are so cool, so drunk with
the swirl of the wind and of the river --
oblivious to winter,
the last to let go and fall
into the water and on the ground.


[HE.]  PRITHEE, pretty maiden - prithee, tell me true
(Hey, but I'm doleful, willow, willow waly!)
Have you e'er a lover a-dangling after you?
Hey, willow waly O!
I would fain discover
If you have a lover?
Hey, willow waly O!

[SHE.]  Gentle sir, my heart is frolicsome and free -
(Hey, but he's doleful, willow, willow waly!)
Nobody I care for comes a-courting me -
Hey, willow waly O!
Nobody I care for
Comes a-courting - therefore,
Hey, willow waly O!

[HE.]  Prithee, pretty maiden, will you marry me?
(Hey, but I'm hopeful, willow, willow waly!)
I may say, at once, I'm a man of propertee -
Hey, willow waly O!
Money, I despise it,
But many people prize it,
Hey, willow waly O!

[SHE.]  Gentle sir, although to marry I design -
(Hey, but he's hopeful, willow, willow waly!)
As yet I do not know you, and so I must decline.
Hey, willow waly O!
To other maidens go you -
As yet I do not know you,
Hey, willow waly O


I can’t stand Willy Wet-Leg, 
  Can’t stand him at any price. 
  He’s resigned, and when you hit him 
  he lets you hit him twice. 

Wilt thou take me for thy slave,
With my folly and my love?
Wilt thou take me for the bondsman of thy pride?
Thou who dearer art to me than all the world beside;
For I love thee as no other man can love.

Wilt thou take me to thy soul,
For the truth which thou shalt prove?
Wilt thou clothe me with the riches of thy care?
Thou who dearer art to me than gold and jewels rare;
For I love thee as no other man can love.

Wilt thou take me for thy king,
While the sun and stars shall move?
Wilt thou pay me back the homage I have given?
Oh thou dearer unto me than sun and stars and heaven!
For I love thee as no other man can love.


Whipping boy of Victorian days.
Weeping lonely Silent prays.
Dies an rises that uncouth.
The lash will pain as it rains.
Welts and wheals of those canes.
The rending howl is deeper yet, 
dwells profound an endless fret.
Chutes and lutes and em toys, 
goodies of life for those boys.
HE forgets to send me die; 
be beaten blue at every ploy.
Smell of cordite bitter sweet.
All the better taken neat.
Burn the orchard trample wheat.
Smoke em out with searing heat.
Distant mumbles turn to grumble, 
an in time a gun will rumble.
Crush a bone and pulp the flesh
in time shall geal to steely mesh



"Beautiful deceit", 
It’s what I like to call her
For deceit is what I’ve been given
And in her its manifestation.

Her beautiful deceit
When I lay down
And push
Knowing full well, 
Beauty is fleeting
But for now
It's mine to enjoy.

All the time
Fraudulent eyes
And in me
A willing accomplice, 
As if together
Two disconnected
Batteries
That once were fully charged. 

And I feel 
Perhaps rightfully so, 
That it is not me
Who deserves her.
For only do I have her
Which as an instance
Is less than I’d like.

But at one time
She was full time
And also, 
unappreciated.
A flower as such
may rise, 
But will never bloom
in certain conditions.

I should’ve known
When the women I knew: 
"she is beauty! ' and 'how lucky' 
I’ve only heard women
talk the same
of movie stars and models. 

Then winter came
And I lost my flower 
Who grew busy blooming
On another tree.
Now the remnants of what was mine, 
are finite and in partiality
often 
fleeting. 

Yet even partial
I will take her
until displays of passion are no more
Because when I’m in
it is certain

I have never seen such a 
beautiful deceit.  


Her ruddy cheeks grew pale
Her face like a dented kitchenware
Now a symbol of blighted loveliness
Sorrow buried in the recesses of her heart
She lets them cower and brood
Dormant fires, 
Anytime may grow into a conflagration
Dry sorrow sucks her blood
Her sleep poisoned by melancholy
She has been a Moon
Now veiled by mist
Once she glowed with radiance and beauty
Now there is a wintry chill
Inside and outside

In the shade of a giant oak, 
She grew from a tender tree, 
To the pride and beauty of the grove
Graceful in form
Bright in foliage
But struck by
An unexpected pestilence
It is withering
Drooping its branches down
Shedding leaf by leaf
To fall down and rot
Like that shady oak, abruptly cut down


Wanted & loved  by millions.
We shell have it at all cost.
Will power  always enjoy supermacy.
Widely omnipresent in every field.
With hardwork & devotion a road is created.
Where object egarly standing with open arm.
When object about to shake your hand.
While shaking hand, please keep in mind preservation.
Without preservation true sense of achievement is meaningless.
What is important maintenance & preservation of achievement for long


Why does death follow me? 
Never letting me out of its sight, 
Keeping me close, holding me tight
I can't struggle, I can't escape, 
Forever in an embrace, of a Skeletons hold, 
Listening to deaths every word, 
As if its that of a beautiful song, 
Death lifts his Scyth, to my throat, 
Tells me to 'stop, ' he says 'lets have some fun, '
Death like life is a game, so simple? 



wind
 
shrieks    cold pale light
strikes hawthorn trees
fierce beaks snatch fruit
red bristles poke from branches
 
wind rattles fragile panes
howls    buffets jays
drunk on spoiled berries
circling crazily    dazed
 
wind moans    maple leaves crowd down
still-green    scarred with black pox
thick raindrops fall
wash away dark scent of rot
 
useless to fear what's ahead
gusts come and go
bring on sedum's late blooms
then whirl away November's frail remains


This is the wind, the wind in a field of corn.
Great crowds are fleeing from a major disaster
Down the green valleys, the long swaying wadis, 
Down through the beautiful catastrophe of wind.

Families, tribes, nations, and their livestock
Have heard something, seen something.  An expectation
Or a gigantic misunderstanding has swept over the hilltop
Bending the ear of the hedgerow with stories of fire and sword.

I saw a thousand years pass in two seconds.
Land was lost, languages rose and divided.
This lord went east and found safety.
His brother sought Africa and a dish of aloes.

Centuries, minutes later, one might ask
How the hilt of a sword wandered so far from the smithy.
And somewhere they will sing: 'Like chaff we were borne
In the wind. '  This is the wind in a field of corn. 


Lovers, forget your love, 
And list to the love of these, 
She a window flower, 
And he a winter breeze. 
When the frosty window veil 
Was melted down at noon, 
And the caged yellow bird 
Hung over her in tune, 
He marked her through the pane, 
He could not help but mark, 
And only passed her by, 
To come again at dark. 
He was a winter wind, 
Concerned with ice and snow, 
Dead weeds and unmated birds, 
And little of love could know. 
But he sighed upon the sill, 
He gave the sash a shake, 
As witness all within 
Who lay that night awake. 
Perchance he half prevailed 
To win her for the flight 
From the firelit looking-glass 
And warm stove-window light. 
But the flower leaned aside 
And thought of naught to say, 
And morning found the breeze 
A hundred miles away. 


The door of winter
is frozen shut, 

and like the bodies
of long extinct animals, cars 

lie abandoned wherever
the cold road has taken them. 

How ceremonious snow is,
with what quiet severity 

it turns even death to a formal
arrangement. 

Alone at my window, I listen
to the wind, 

to the small leaves clicking
in their coffins of ice. 


As the trees play in the breeze
Do you wonder what it may mean.
Does the wind coming from a certain direction
Mean something we should heed.

North wind blows cold and dry
Originating from the elements of earth
Read as the wind of death, colour black
Time to abondon issues no longer needed
Heed the news from the North.

West wind blows moist and fertile
Elements of water, coloured blue
Soothing, sensitive and healing.
Touch the cleansing power of the West.

South wind blows hot and dry
Of element fire, colour red
Usethe initiative and passion
To boost the ideals
Haste to feel the southern breeze.

East wind blows from the orient light
Assaulting with cold dry feel
Symbol of air, coloured white
Trust new starts from the East.

North South East and West
Thus the world changes
From whence it blows
That is what it will show
Predictions blown around. 


No one can tell me,
Nobody knows,
Where the wind comes from,
Where the wind goes.


It's flying from somewhere
As fast as it can,
I couldn't keep up with it,
Not if I ran.

But if I stopped holding
The string of my kite,
It would blow with the wind
For a day and a night.

And then when I found it,
Wherever it blew,
I should know that the wind
Had been going there too.

So then I could tell them
Where the wind goes. 
But where the wind comes from
Nobody knows. 


As the waves violently crashed against the white seashore
An invisible but quite ferocious wind still blows forever more
Its mighty power rises up and stretches like a rushing wonder
She held back her reckless visage then only seemed to ponder

Mariners, boaters and fishermen alike all brave that stormy sea
From the north, south, east and west or wither the gusty winds be
Relentless winds that never cease is out of the seafarers control

Seagulls soaring high up above searching the deep sea for fish
Winds whistling their woeful tunes as if they're making a wish
Its forces begins to diminish then the water becomes calm again
Wistful songs will always be heard but no one will ever know when



fury of nature untamed
by man

It blew so hard that it was hard
to understand

In circularity it was not full of
any hilarity

Creating concern it was coming into
town full of vulgarity

Blowing off roofs, uprooting trees, 
scaring all this night

Out they all went the substations, 
and the lights

Blowin in the wind was the soul of
nature's chant

Dismiss me humankind at your peril
for I will overpower your cant


And a fresh breeze will draw your attention
Rustle of silk at the front door
Welcome the pool of light inside then
It will bring with it 
Some snatches of conversation
Deep murmurs, laughter
Vows made; the ones we made, once! 
Follow that light
May it lead to sudden revelations? 
Moments; turned into immortal memories
Shared by two travelers
-
Some evening 
When every night will be a starry night
And all the year it will be spring
You will know, we will know
How two travelers came close
So close to be called ONE. 

Windows open vistas for us
Windows - of hearts, of minds or of eyes
Windows - which might open outward
Or inward
They bring the light on the other end to this end.

Windows converse
They open the alphabetical locks of our lips 
When night weaves nets of darkness on windows
Life-spans speak out in whispers from abysses of pain
Windows then perforce remain silent
Suffer days of tongue-tied laws
Nights of oppression
And epochs of tyranny

Windows are self same stories of dreams
Of centuries
Mute testimony of chasms
Court yards and ruined houses
Evidence of rusted eons rattling with exhaustion
in tyrant time's primordium continuity

Windows have the heart of a woman
They open their body's wings of each clime
With a little waft of wind
With fragrance, sunlight, rain or moon beams.
They blow away paper-light images
And waste away life in uncharted desires.

When butterflies fly in front of windows
Eyes glued to window panes become tearful
With noontide memories.
Evenings look forward to a wayfarer passing by
When they're covered with climbers
holding forth red and white flowers
They fill closed fists with the touch of fire-flies.

Windows often insist on being kept open 
They're surprised to watch cloud, birds
And the blue sky's expanse
If they're kept shut
They're afraid of the life breath of 
Walls and rooms getting strangulated.
They're afraid of dwellers forsaking their houses
They also feel life's desertion
They also feel despondent
Windows are human beings! 



In a barren garden
Of repressed desires
Parched to the core
And in need of love
To rejuvenate its being

Blossomed at the very hint
Of the touch
Of the friendly West Wind
Trumpeting the arrival of Spring
In its seemingly eternal
Autumnal existence.

Imagine this, 
If a single hint of breeze
Could bring to life 
This long dead bud
What would an Eternal Spring
Do to it? 

Caress it out of its 
Vegetative existence? 
Fill it with fragrance? 
Promise that it would never ever
Let autumn set in? 
Or is it too early for the hopeful bud
To surmise the intent of Spring? 



Twilight declares its arrival

The waves crash against the rocks

The traffic moves slowly

The crowds buzz by

We can't look eye to eye.


 

The mood was light

Now silence hangs low

Thoughts create a tornado

From him to her and her to him

Suddenly melancholy spurts

And words follow.

 

The winds of depression

From the fathoms of the ocean

Swayed-

Our mood

Our talks

Our thoughts

Our love

For a while

And no more.

 

Lights glowed bright

Waves calmed

Traffic smoothed

Crowds did not bother

Luckily, 

Oceans have a shore

Winds changes course 

 

The winds died down

Depression sucked out

Eyes found the strength

To look at another of their kind

Only you were around

With a heart full of love.


Impassioned perturbed, I look at life.
At concrete jungles and their strife.

Rainbow’s promise shredded to naught.
Pouring shards on the weary path.

Bitterness stirs the vacant heart.
Blurry gaze at the apple cart. 

Smoke and smog suffuses through.
Spreading scourges of pain and flu.

The sun it hides in Stifling skies.
Truth, too, engulfed in deceitful lies.

Earth-tones once, that stood back blues.
Now like devils dance, to autumn hues.

Whence they riot, for whom they float; 
on embers Innocence, as they gloat! 

Sit on tombs and suppress their glee.
Interred the bones and set them free.

When roosting rooks are back at home.
To tell off giants, as pygmies, gnomes.

When shalt not stand, mounts and hills.
Only carmine ponds shall eke out thrills. 


Famed for contemptuous breach of sacred ties,
By headless Charles see heartless Henry lies;
Between them stands another sceptred thing--
It moves, it reigns--in all but name, a king: 

Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
- In him the double tyrant starts to life:
Justice and death have mix'd their dust in vain,
Each royal vampire wakes to life again.
Ah, what can tombs avail!--since these disgorge
The blood and dust of both--to mould a George. 


At my daughter's grave, thirty days
after her death:

        Windy fall--
        these are the scarlet flowers
        she liked to pick.




Oh! 
Wight of puny might 
Junk the junk food 
it’s dynamite 
Shun the Sugar 
it’s cyanide. 
Avoid drinks and give up smoke 
transform yourself into a nice bloke, 
And you wont have diabetes nor stroke; 
for depression cannot be 
hidden in whirls of smoke 
nor anxiety cannot be 
shrouded by a joint of coke. 
Nor Alcohol can dissolve the 
molecules of stress 
Nor amphetamine can 
give you an ace in race.

The body tyrannizes by deluge of desires 
bear the lashes of excesses diet 
insatiably taken day and night; 
It is attacked by army of trans fat 
and terrorist of cholesterol. 
The arteries are thickened 
and body is sickened; 
Diabetes and strokes becomes 
unwanted guest, 
A penalty of satisfying 
wanton tastes. 

But when a man of vision 
performs yoga in all seasons, 
that suffuses his cells with 
rejuvenating divine oxygen; 
Then hidden viruses 
on suicidal mission
gets trapped in 
fortified cellular garrison, 
And the bullets of oxygen 
punishes them for trespassing, 
with the charges of treason, 
And all pampered cell rejoices 
in unison without reasons.

Be considerate; Be moderate 
Be calm and cool 
Don’t be a damn fool 
Treat your body as a precious tool. 
Drink a wine of joy and peace 
or a wine of contentment and bliss; 
For they are wines of health- 
Nay all beings true wealth. 

When summer comes, bugs are aplenty
Especially if it has rained a day or two before
Beetles come whirring in
Through the open window rudderless
And hit on the walls like small pellets
They sometimes fall upside down
With their tiny legs tilted up 
And lie down awhile in their initial shock, 
Unable to take off immediately

If we are not quite careful
They get crushed under our feet
With a small explosive sound
Making us conscious of our inadvertent step
These innocuous winged visitors, 
Thus unwittingly are stamped to death
 
Know life can wither away quite abrupt 
By trespassing into unwelcome territory


Like a creature hibernating in its burrow
Waiting to come out with the first verdure of spring
The seed of a poem lay dormant in my heart
Through the long winter awaiting another spring

After staying torpid inside for long
At a time I expected it the least
Timidly came out the first word
As shaky as a calf getting up for the first time

Then another came and word after word in a row
Like pellets of rain on the window pane
I boiled them in the crucibles of my imagination
And finally dipping them in the ocean of my emotions

But rhyme came to set constraints
For the right alignment I struggled
I had to decide on its texture and format
Pondered if it should be a sonnet or an ode

I might have kept the door open for long
Alas! All my words and fancies flew away
Like birds taking on wings into the sky
From a cage where they were imprisoned for long

I stood so helpless with my mouth shut
Staring blankly out into the airy nothing
Like one lost in the doorway of his own threshold
Unable to call back those winged words lost in the void


Dark labirynth your snaky paths of sentiments.
How to orient exit's great stride
towards the world of measures and weights, 
world you never were fond of
so to have ready  access, coordinates! 
You hang your hope's courage on  winged words, 
free scattered on the market of impressions
by all sorts of candidates for an enchanting sceptre.
With their feathery offerings, you dream
effortlessly climbing up
to happiness lofts you are longing for.
You wander to your daedalic delusions
aimlessly spinning around your blind meanders, 
complicated by the feathery tentacles
your hopeless boldness armed your fantasy.
But it's the winged soul
which gives feathers to freedom from passions
not the empty promises, 
winged words. 


Reading Love Poems
fills my time
during these days which
usher Summer across the
threshold of Spring.
THERE is the possibility
of a Love Match: SPRING 
plus SUMMER.
            Why not cast
for the last days of Spring
VENUS, mature, beautiful, 
proud, impatient for 
some greater purpose. 
And for SUMMER that lithe, 
callow lad, ADONIS, he of
the innocent allure, who
makes all the girls
melt with tenderness. But
he is ready only to kill
whatever runs or flies, 
although not to face death, 
not the slow dying of his 
victims, from whom he averts
his eyes and ears, and waits, 
without patience or impatience.
- Adonis of the empty head
and the untouched heart.

'Oh, when will Adonis
grow up, so we can have 
some peace, ' cry the Wild Ones.
They look in vain for their
rescuer, Cupid of the Amorous Arrows.
'Is he so busy wreaking
havoc on humans and gods
that he ignores our plight? '
The Wild Ones are close
to despair. 'Oh, Cupid, 
you dazzling child, come
to aid us.  '

Cupid rests for a moment
on a ledge of rocks. He 
lets himself slowly slip
over the edge, and thus 
fall into flight, as
his wings immediately unfold.
Every day Cupid makes
gods and humans
fall in love as he falls
in flight. He strikes 
each victim with a single 
arrow, then pauses
to observe the passion 
and the pleasure he has
released. He dearly loves
to witness that moment
when they lose control.
'I caused that! ' He 
exclaims, delighted
by his mastery. 'I have
this power over them. 
It's as if they
do not live, have not lived
until I make them
love. Then, only then
do they know the fullness
of being alive. Ah, this
is such an immense world, 
still wet from birthing, 
and I cast the spells
in which the gods and
humans grow up and embrace
this destiny - THEIR DESTINY! '

Cupid calls no building
home. But everywhere
he is an honored guest. 
JOVE always welcomes
his visits to the GOLDEN
PALACE on Mount Olympus.
Jove smiles over Cupid, 
and strokes his head, 
and says for all to hear.
'I'm proud of you, 
little god, you bring
joy to gods and humans
alike. Sensual bliss
stretches both of our 
races to their full stature.
Long will you prosper! 
Now, fulfill my latest
wish: Center your arrows
on Venus and the lad Adonis.
Go swiftly, little god. 
and fulfill my wish.'

Cupid fulfilled Jove's
wish with astonishing
ease. Before vast Night
completed its task
of bringing to the world
darkness and rest, 
Venus and Adonis, 
our Spring and Summer, 
were lovers, mingled
in the spell of Bliss.

Venus and Adonis
in sweet sweating embrace
hovered just above the ground
of her grotto in a quiet woods.
'Dear Adonis, ' she began, 
paused, wondering in lingering
bliss. She smiled, there was 
no need for words: their 
cries of delight
had bonded them better
than words. She was folded
in a warmth that
resembled pure sleep
like the perfect content 
of the Fixed Stars
of the Firmament.

'Dear Venus, ' he began, 
paused, puzzled by
the bliss lingering in his limbs.
Never before had the scent
of flowers so stunned him
as they had this night
in Venus's bower.
                As he
tightened his embrace, 
she seemed to be the most
fragrant flower of all.
He felt an expanding tenderness
soften the rough edges
of his life and make him
think thoughts as high 
above his former life
as the Fixed Stars
are above the pale moon. 

Under the pale moon light, 
I shall kiss you a thousand times; 
Under the waxen clouds, 
Slowly walking on the blanket of stars, 
I shall hold you tight; 
Be your angel fallen from the skies.  .

I shall blessed the evening light
On its bold silvery smile
You'll find me there within your heart
Within your soul, within your psyche
Because I am you and you are me
We belong together in strings of memories
Even at times we diverge each other pitifully

Don't you see I am your shadow? 
Your other half, the wings of your mind
The feet of your consciousness
That goes in extreme polarity
In temperament's name
And obscure ringing conditions
Under the mind's game. 




Every step I want to walk
In illusion I do not trust
Only you are my mentor.

I want to read and write
Whatever you teach everyday
That winks life with joy
Truth is there in your tale.

You wink my path forever
In ink of light to write 
Let me shine in trust daily
Your wisdom is ever super.

No more I attach to matters
These do not last for long
I am eternal soul I love
I hold eternity in winking. 

In that realistic world
Exigencies you may face
Calamities may encounter
Crises you confront

Why worry, you got your weapons
Sting, flight, big eyes, 
Powered antennae
Camouflaged body

Use them aptly and sparingly
Know your limits
Know your boundaries
Hail your values
Gain your objectives
Never be arrogant

Be yourself, why surrogate
Be focused and determined 
A winner you'll be, at the end


Anger, hatred, anxiety, Jealousy, greed  et cetera
Attired in nice looking selfish clan outfit  
Come dashing to you, every now and then
To hug, embrace, kiss and warm you up

Kindness, compassion, empathy, altruism 
Do come far behind, at slow pace in haze
Who ever how ever comes need to wait 
Just a moment, till you open the gate

Sole key to the same is in your hand
Know ‘n recognize each, in advance
Hold on for a moment, ere you open
Consult the most sincere guardian, the conscience

Heed to guardian's faithful advice
Say no, an unwavering NO, very determined
To what it deserves and let in only that
In your judgment, the most desired and needed

Bubbling with enthusiasm, turning a game of
ordinary pool into an inventive game of 
rolling brains.
Excitement mounting as they send them into
pockets of winners. 


When icicles hang by the wall 
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail 
And Tom bears logs into the hall, 
And milk comes frozen home in pail, 
When Blood is nipped and ways be foul, 
Then nightly sings the staring owl, 
Tu-who; 
Tu-whit, tu-who: a merry note, 
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. 

When all aloud the wind doth blow, 
And coughing drowns the parson's saw, 
And birds sit brooding in the snow, 
And Marian's nose looks red and raw 
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl, 
Then nightly sings the staring owl, 
Tu-who; 
Tu-whit, tu-who: a merry note, 
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot. 


How large that thrush looks on the bare thorn-tree! 
A swarm of such, three little months ago, 
Had hidden in the leaves and let none know 
Save by the outburst of their minstrelsy. 
A white flake here and there—a snow-lily 
Of last night's frost—our naked flower-beds hold; 
And for a rose-flower on the darkling mould 
The hungry redbreast gleams. No bloom, no bee.
The current shudders to its ice-bound sedge; 
Nipped in their bath, the stark reeds one by one 
Flash each its clinging diamond in the sun: 
'Neath winds which for this winter's sovereign pledge 
Shall curb great king-masts to the ocean's edge 
And leave memorial forest-kings o'erthrown. 

Now that the earth has hid her lovely brood 
Of green things in her breast safe out of sight, 
And all the trees have stripped them for the fight, 
The winter comes with wild winds singing rude, 
Hoarse battle songs-so furious in feud 
That nothing lives that has not felt their bite. 
They sound a trumpet in the dead of night 
That makes more solitary solitude. 
Against the forest doors how fierce they beat! 
Against the porch, against the school-bound boy 
With crimson cheek bent to his shaggy coat. 
The earth is pale but steadfast, hearing sweet 
But far-how far away!-the stream of joy 
Outpouring from a bluebird's tender throat. 


Clouded with snow 
The cold winds blow, 
And shrill on leafless bough 
The robin with its burning breast 
Alone sings now. 

The rayless sun, 
Day's journey done, 
Sheds its last ebbing light 
On fields in leagues of beauty spread 
Unearthly white. 

Thick draws the dark, 
And spark by spark, 
The frost-fires kindle, and soon 
Over that sea of frozen foam 
Floats the white moon. 


Rocks cleft and turned to dust reveal
cleft shells to be as stone; and cricket skulls
in powdered light give your quick, analytic mandate:
Un-think these things. Gun-roused at dusk
a cock'll bugle 'Kyrie.' Get the geometry of event.
When your lungs failed at war
my mother pulse of dividends revived.
Other theorems of Truth; of Beauty, other corollary!


   As over water when a mill-sluice shuts
   film ice twitches between inverted
   tendril and frond, frond and tendril;
   your rushing brain lay still.
   Our bold-voluted immortality, fallen
                       is only rock
   -though proud in ruin, piteous in pride-
                        Ned. Ned.
   Snow on a dome, blown by night wind. 


Winter comes to withdraw 
Streams of hot thoughts
More powerful feelings again
And stay inside to burst out.

Birds built nests
Caravans coddles 
Behind the curtain
 Welcome spring again.

Leaves of trees turned into purple 
Sing the songs of nature
Behold warm feelings
And drop down all.

Procure pictures and turnouts
And new buds of thoughts 
Release again afresh mornings
And stay inside to burst out.

Mist is gone and murmurs
Fill the your hearts
New meanings for humanity
And sing the songs of love. 


Winter, winter, how I feel your icy touch
The earth is under your freezing clutch
I hear the roar of gales from far
The sky is overcast without a single star

 Icicles hang from the boughs of leafless trees
Nowhere can one spot the buzzing summer bees
Birds sit with wings drooping in their woody nests
From our sight, have departed all the beasts

Trees stand sleeping in the biting cold
And the sun has lost its sheen of gold
From nowhere comes the song of a single bird
On the slopes, none can sight the grazing herd

Roof tops are crusted with flakes of snow
Which the sun with sharp beams alone can thaw
Piles of snow lie heaped on the barren ground
And the entire Earth in a sea of ice drowned

Busy streets and pavements are now lying bare
People stay indoors and to go out, they hardly dare
      The rodents have gone into hibernation in their ditch
And life altogether has gone out of pitch


In the smiting chill of a dreadful wintry night
When even through our bones, we feel the cold bite
How we like to sit cocooned beside the hearth
Sipping a cup of steaming tea in rising mirth

In such quiet hours, one can peruse into the pages of tomes
That will transport you to enchanting magical zones
 Or engage in a hearty chat with friends and family
Thus turning even the bleakest hours, sweet and lively


Winter
Lonely, quiet
Raining, snowing, freezing
Day in, day out
Endless


Pain of loss hurting me within, piercing my mind through
times of remembering in past memories.

Alive and vibrant, touching upon the bittersweet memories
deep inside.

Your love having taken all mine with you, I have nothing
left to give another, you were my all in life.

Seasons come and go, but winter is always upon me, bleak
and saddened, even when the sun is shining upon the snow.

As it glistens, it is a reminder of tears that continue to
fall in memories, because I'm missing you so much, my dear. 


Why is it our NEW YEAR
begins just as WINTER enters
his old age? Must we always
drag that dotage with us
for weeks, even months? 
Why can't we shove it
against one of those snow piles
which will take five days
of sunlight to melt
into the cool blue air? 
Or spread it over the moist
morning lawn and let
yellow grasses drink it? 
Why do we feel responsible
for Father Winter when already
his burgeoning son stretches out
beneath ice and snow? 
Is there a hesitation in us
the year feels as a lack of welcome? 
Does the calendar itself shift
imperceptibly sensing a longer winter? 
Whatever it is, I'm sick of it: I want
the cheer, the uplift, the snap of time.
Or is it simply time to rev my faith
in the everlastingness
of the seasons? Words like immortal
and eternal occupy still
their niches in my mind.
Suddenly I realize this year will slip out of
its mortality the way a snake sheds 
its old skin and slithers into grass mounds
out of sight. Things are never as difficult
as they seem at first. I kick the discarded skin
aside, and we walk down a clear path together.


All day between high-curded clouds the sun
Shone down like summer on the steaming planks.
The long, bright icicles in dwindling ranks
Dripped from the murmuring eaves till one by one
They fell. As if the spring had now begun,
The quilted snow, sun-softened to the core,
Loosened and shunted with a sudden roar
From downward roofs. Not even with day done
Had ceased the sound of waters, but all night
I heard it. In my dreams forgetfully bright
Methought I wandered in the April woods,
Where many a silver-piping sparrow was,
By gurgling brooks and spouting solitudes,
And stooped, and laughed, and plucked hepaticas. 


Winter thoughts chilling my insides, 
freezing creative manners in time.
Flames of ice, causing ripples of excitement, 
as peace fills inner chambers with calming 
balms of essence. 


Spring is here, yet winter has not left us.
It's a time for blossoms to come forth - but they are freezing 
from the cold.
Look out a window and see the bright sun shining everywhere, 
see the warmth hanging in the air? 
Outside the door, I take a step, my breath I can see blowing 
in the wind.
It's cold against my skin and quickly I step back in.
Contented now to watch the warm looking sunshine from a window 
within my heated room. 


Watch the bullock carts filled with crops, 
The farmers bring after harvesting drops.
After long day wait time of harvest come, 
Farmers in winter do chant leaf fixes gum. 

Fields are filled with many vegetable plants, 
Busy in collecting grains you watch line ants.
Rats do jump in harvesting fields of paddy, 
They too hide and come and go calling daddy.

In mean while we watch and soon we do feel, 
Poor people do warm burning dusts, see in drill.
Winter festivals come children collect rice corn, 
Some move on and some do think to winter burn.

There is long path fallen through rice field we walk, 
Due to cold fever some for medication go to quack.
Winter blossoms with fragrance of flowers in street, 
Every day at morning sun comes winter we do meet.

Harvesting of paddy is a major part of our cultivation, 
Farmers cultivate vegetables and do soon motivation.
Winter is the season that comes with hope pleasure, 


Winter downpour - 
even the monkey 
needs a raincoat. 

Winter drips last grain
Shadows age by four thirty
Paired lives be; worthy


Dark frost was in the air without, 
The dusk was still with cold and gloom, 
When less than even a shadow came 
And stood within the room. 

But the three around the fire, 
None turned a questioning head to look, 
Still read a clear voice, on and on, 
Still stooped they o'er their book. 

The children watched their mother's eyes 
Moving on softly line to line; 
It seemed to listen too -- that shade, 
Yet made no outward sign. 

The fire-flames crooned a tiny song, 
No cold wind moved the wintry tree; 
The children both in Faerie dreamed 
Beside their mother's knee. 

And nearer yet that spirit drew 
Above that heedless one, intent 
Only on what the simple words 
Of her small story meant. 


No voiceless sorrow grieved her mind, 
No memory her bosom stirred, 
Nor dreamed she, as she read to two, 
'Twas surely three who heard. 

Yet when, the story done, she smiled 
From face to face, serene and clear, 
A love, half dead, sprang up, as she 
Leaned close and drew them near. 


I WATCH the great clear twilight
Veiling the ice-bowed trees;
Their branches tinkle faintly
With crystal melodies.
The larches bend their silver
Over the hush of snow;
One star is lighted in the west,
Two in the zenith glow.
For a moment I have forgotten
Wars and women who mourn—
I think of the mother who bore me
And thank her that I was born. 


To-night the very horses springing by
  Toss gold from whitened nostrils. In a dream
  The streets that narrow to the westward gleam
  Like rows of golden palaces; and high
  From all the crowded chimneys tower and die
  A thousand aureoles. Down in the west
  The brimming plains beneath the sunset rest,
  One burning sea of gold. Soon, soon shall fly
  The glorious vision, and the hours shall feel
  A mightier master; soon from height to height,
  With silence and the sharp unpitying stars,
  Stern creeping frosts, and winds that touch like steel,
  Out of the depth beyond the eastern bars,
  Glittering and still shall come the awful night. 


I

Winter without
And warmth within;
The winds may shout
And the storm begin;
The snows may pack
At the window pane,
And the skies grow black,
And the sun remain
Hidden away
The livelong day--
But here--in here is the warmth of May!

II

Swoop your spitefullest
Up the flue,
Wild Winds--do!
What in the world do I care for you?
O delightfullest
Weather of all,
Howl and squall,
And shake the trees till the last leaves fall!

III

The joy one feels,
In an easy chair,
Cocking his heels
In the dancing air
That wreathes the rim of a roaring stove
Whose heat loves better than hearts can love,
Will not permit
The coldest day
To drive away
The fire in his blood, and the bliss of it!

IV

Then blow, Winds, blow!
And rave and shriek,
And snarl and snow
Till your breath grows weak--
While here in my room
I'm as snugly shut
As a glad little worm
In the heart of a nut


The cascade resounds behind operetta huts. 
Fireworks prolong, through the orchards 
and avenues near the Meander,-- 
the greens and reds of the setting sun. 
Horace nymphs with First Empire headdresses,-- 
Siberian rounds and Boucher's Chinese ladies. 


A Shadow of hard stone
shivers in the soft water
Icy winter night.

A gentle door knock
Is it winter 's cool breeze
or a spring as a guest.

Womanly winter
fails to cool off 
smouldering passion


Blanket

Snow falls silently
Covering all in deep sleep
Spring is yet far off


Winter Fast Approaching

The leaves drift downward
The season is almost done
As North wind blows cold


Rest

Gentle flakes fall slow
Water hardens to crystal
The world goes to sleep



To find contentment in the little parts of life, the ones that
don't seem to matter.

Unimportant symbols filed under daily routines, unavailable in
the brightness of daylight.

Unapproachable from every aspect of decency and truth, yet
totally available to a soul of sorrow.

Laced, white, little tears of irony flowing down cheeks of 
innocent beginnings.

Soundless, adorable, forgotten in the midst of a winter 
storm.

Allowed no heat, no fire, to thaw a frozen heart, once
drowning in the tears of sorrow, laden heart held away from
life.

Thrown down a staircase, unrecognized, scarred by the 
heartaches of childhood.

Left to find contentment in an uncontented world, stepping
aside, capturing the little particles of life in a sieve, 
never held, even for a minute.

Unimportant parts, the ones that don't matter, stay with you
an eternity, never being able to turn them out. 



Life is not all for effort: there are hours,
When fancy breaks from the exacting will,
And rebel though takes schoolboy's holiday,
Rejoicing in its idle strength. 'Tis then,
And only at such moments, that we know
The treasure of hours gone-scenes once beheld,
Sweet voices and words bright and beautiful,
The loveliness of forms and thoughts and colors,
A moment marked and then as soon forgotten.
These things are ever near us, laid away,
Hidden and waiting the appropriate times,
In the quiet garner-house of memory.
There in the silent unaccounted depth,
Beneath the heated strainage and the rush
That teem the noisy surface of the hours,
All things that ever touched us are stored up,
Growing more mellow like sealed wine with age;
We thought them dead, and they are but asleep.
In moments when the heart is most at rest
And least expectant, from the luminous doors,
And sacred dwelling place of things unfeared,
They issue forth, and we who never knew
Till then how potent and how real they were,
Take them, and wonder, and so bless the hour.

Such gifts are sweetest when unsought. To me,
As I was loitering lately in my dreams,
Passing from one remembrance to another,
Like him who reads upon an outstretched map,
Content and idly happy, these rose up,
Out of that magic well-stored picture house,
No dream, rather a thing most keenly real,
The memory of a moment, when with feet,
Arrested and spell bound, and captured eyes,
Made wide with joy and wonder, I beheld
The spaces of a white and wintery land
Swept with the fire of sunset, all its width,
Vale, forest, town, and misty eminence,
A miracle of color and of beauty.


I had walked out, as I remember now,
With covered ears, for the bright air was keen,
To southward up the gleaming snow-packed fields,
With the snowshoer's long rejoicing stride,
Marching at ease. It was a radiant day
In February, the month of the great struggle
'Twixt sun and frost, when with advancing spears,
The glittering golden vanguard of the spring
Holds the broad winter's yet unbroken rear
In long-closed wavering contest. Thin pale threads
Like streaks of ash across the far off blue
Were drawn, nor seemed to move. A brooding silence
Kept all the land, a stillness as of sleep;
But in the east the grey and motionless woods,
Watching the great sun's fiery slow decline,
Grew deep with gold. To westward all was silver.
An hour had passed above me; I had reached;
The loftiest level of the snow-piled fields,
Clear eyed, but unobservant noting not,
That all the plain beneath me and the hills
Took on a change of colour, splendid, gradual,
Leaving no spot the same; nor that the sun
Now like a fiery torrent overflamed
The great line of the west. Ere yet I turned
With long stride homeward, being heated
With the loose swinging motion, weary too,
Nor uninclined to rest, a buried fence,
Whose topmost log just shouldered from the snow,
Made me a seat, and thence with heated cheeks,
Grazed by the northwind's edge of stinging ice,
I looked far out upon the snow-bound waste,
The lifting hills and intersecting forests,
The scarce marked courses of the buried streams,
And as I looked I list memory of the frost,
Transfixed with wonder, overborne with joy.
I saw them in their silence and their beauty;
Swept by the sunset's rapid hand of fire,
Sudden, mysterious, every moment deepening
To some new majesty of rose or flame.
The whole broad west was like molten sea
Of crimson. In the north the light-lined hills
Were veiled far off as with a mist of rose
Wondrous and soft. Along the darkening east
The gold of all the forests slowly changed
To purple. In the valley far before me,
Low sunk in sapphire shadows, from its hills,
Softer and lovelier than an opening flower,
Uprose a city with its sun-touched towers,
A bunch of amethysts.


Like one spell-bound
Caught in the presence of some god, I stood,
Nor felt the keen wind and the deadly air,
But watched the sun go down, and watched the gold
Fade from the town and the withdrawing hills,
Their westward shapes athwart the dusky red
Freeze into sapphire, saw the arc of rose
Rise ever higher in the violet east,
Above the frore front of the uprearing night
Remorsefully soft and sweet. Then I awoke
As from a dream, and from my shoulders shook
The warning chill, till then unfelt, unfeared. 



Came and passed the golden autumn in the forest's gloomy shade,
And the northern blasts of winter swept along the silent glade,

When the chilly night was over, once at morn the prince of fame,

Meek-eyed Sita softly followed with the pitcher in her arms,
Gallant Lakshman spake to Rama of the Indian winter's charms:

'Comes the bright and bracing winter to the royal Rama dear,
Like a bride the beauteous season doth in richest robes appear,

Frosty air and freshening zephyrs wake to life each mart and plain,
And the corn in dewdropp sparkling makes a sea of waving green,

But the village maid and matron shun the freezing river's shore,
By the fire the village elder tells the stirring tale of yore!

With the winter's ample harvest men perform each pious rite,

With the rite of agrayana pious men their sins dispel,
And with gay and sweet observance songs of love the women tell,

And the monarchs bent on conquest mark the winter's cloudless glow,
Lead their bannered cars and forces 'gainst the rival and the foe!

Southwards rolls the solar chariot, and the cold and widowed North
Reft of 'bridal mark' and joyance coldly sighs her sorrows forth,

Southward rolls the solar chariot, Himalaya, 'home of snow,'
True to name and appellation doth in whiter garments glow,

Southward rolls the solar chariot, cold and crisp the frosty air,
And the wood of flower dismantled doth in russet robes appear!

Star of Pushya rules December and the night with rime is hoar,
And beneath the starry welkin in the woods we sleep no more,

And the pale moon mist-enshrouded sheds a faint and feeble beam,
As the breath obscures the mirror, winter mist obscures her gleam,

Hidden by the rising vapour faint she glistens on the dale,
Like our sun-embrowned Sita with her toil and penance pale!

Sweeping blasts from western mountains through the gorges whistle by
And the saras and the curlew raise their shrill and piercing cry,

Boundless fields of wheat and barley are with dewdrops moist and wet,
And the golden rice of winter ripens like the clustering date,

Peopled marts and rural hamlets wake to life and cheerful toil,
And the peaceful happy nations prosper on their fertile soil!

Mark the sun in morning vapours-like the moon subdued and pale
Brightening as the day advances piercing through the darksome veil,

Mark his gay and golden lustre sparkling o'er the dewy lea,
Mantling hill and field and forest, painting bush and leaf and tree,

Mark it glisten on the green grass, on each bright and bending blade,
Lighten up the long-drawn vista, shooting through the gloomy glade!

Thirst-impelled the lordly tusker still avoids the freezing drink,
Wild duck and the tuneful hansa doubtful watch the river's brink,

From the rivers wrapped in vapour unseen cries the wild curlew,
Unseen rolls the misty streamlet o'er its sandbank soaked in dew,

And the drooping water-lily bends her head beneath the frost,
Lost her fresh and fragrant beauty and her tender petals lost!

Now my errant fancy wanders to Ayodhya's distant town,
Where in hermit's barks and tresses Bharat wears the royal crown,

Scorning regal state and splendoar, spurning pleasures loved of yore,
Spends his winter day in penance, sleeps at night upon the floor,

Aye! perchance Sarayu's waters seeks he now, serene and brave,

Rich of hue, with eye of lotus, truthful, faithful, strong of mind,
For the love he bears thee, Rama, spurns each joy of baser kind,

'False he proves unto his father who is led by mother's wile,'
Vain this ancient impious adage-Bharat spurns his mother's guile,

Deep in craft, hath brought disaster on Ayodhya's royal house!'

'Speak not thus,' so Rama answered, 'on Kaikeyi cast no blame,
Honour still the righteous Bharat, honour still the royal dame,

Fixed in purpose and unchanging still in jungle wilds I roam,
But thy accents, gentle Lakshman, wake a longing for my home!

And my loving mem'ry lingers on each word from Bharat fell
Sweeter than the draught of nectar, purer than the crystal well,

And my righteous purpose falters, shaken by a brother's love,

True once more to righteous purpose Rama's heart was calm and brave

Rama plunged into the river'neath the morning's crimson beam,
Sits, softly sought the waters as the lily seeks the stream,

And they sang the ancient mantra to the red and rising Sun,

With her lord, in loosened tresses Sita to her cottage came,
As with RUDRA wanders UMA in Kailasa's hill of fame


Hear the thunder echoing about
A sky with a green hue
The sign of hail on the way
Lighting giving a great show
Like a fireworks display.

And in the morning
Where once the plants 
Were dying from the heat
Now covered with a blanket of white.
Which many have never seen.

During the night
While most slept
Winter had stolen the Summer
And left a winter scene.

Nearly forget the devastation
With such a wonderous scene
The day in Summer
When the land down under
Woke to a Winter scene.



Little, little cold is arriving
With wings of coldness and snow
This will cover our minds sure
Pure heart will need warmness

You visit the light in life sure
Purity is sparking of life glows
That we feel coldness needs warm.

Blanket is ready to hold mind, 
We need to cover this and feel 
Warmness covers body and spirit
Winter adores seasonal wisdom.

Winter is coming slowly it sees, 
The breeze sparks light more 
Slow coldness is covered by leaves, 
Trees wear blanket of snow in day. 


Snow-covered mountains showing off their dusty white coats of winter to all who pass.
Looking like confectioners' sugar, sprinkled from heaven's realms to earth.
Beautiful winter landscapes sent to our sight as we travel over roads and cut through mountains and into the night. 


Within the circuit of this plodding life 
There enter moments of an azure hue, 
Untarnished fair as is the violet 
Or anemone, when the spring stew them 
By some meandering rivulet, which make 
The best philosophy untrue that aims 
But to console man for his grievences. 
I have remembered when the winter came, 
High in my chamber in the frosty nights, 
When in the still light of the cheerful moon, 
On the every twig and rail and jutting spout, 
The icy spears were adding to their length 
Against the arrows of the coming sun, 
How in the shimmering noon of winter past 
Some unrecorded beam slanted across 
The upland pastures where the Johnwort grew; 
Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind, 
The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag 
Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill, 
Which now through all its course stands still and dumb 
Its own memorial, - purling at its play 
Along the slopes, and through the meadows next, 
Until its youthful sound was hushed at last 
In the staid current of the lowland stream; 
Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned, 
And where the fieldfare followed in the rear, 
When all the fields around lay bound and hoar 
Beneath a thick integument of snow. 
To go upon my winter's task again. 


The tall trees are sad, pale and nude; 
And the leaves are dry. There is no more food
On the branches for the birds. Some hungry squirrels
Are inspecting the abandoned barrels, 
For left-over crackers, or hard-shelled mixed nuts.

Several wandering raccoons sneaked in the huts; 
They destroyed and ate away the antique chairs, 
And the sofa beds that the peasants left for the bears
To enjoy during their three-month sojourn in the city.

Winter must be around the corner; it is a pity
That all sitting and standing waters are now frozen and solid.
From afar, we can hear the wind whistling like a fresh kid.
Winter is not too far, and yet we’re praying for the return
Of spring, as the world incessantly continues to wobble and turn. 


Winter nears. Once more
the bear’s secret retreat
will vanish under mud’s floor,
to a child’s fretful grief.


Huts will wake in the water,
reflecting paths of smoke,
circled by autumn’s tremor
lovers meet by the fire to talk.


Denizens of the harsh North
whose roof is the clear air,
‘In this sign conquer’, set forth,
marks each unreachable lair.

I love you, provincial haunts,
off the map, the road, past the farms,
the more tired and faded the book,
the greater for me its charms.

Slow files of carts lumbering by
you spell out an alphabet flowing
from meadow to meadow. And I
found you always my favourite reading.

And it’s suddenly written again,
here in first snow is the spider’s
cursive script, runners of sleighs,
where ice on the page embroiders.

A silvered hazel October.
Pewter glow since frost began.
Autumn twilight, of Chekhov,
Tchaikovsky, and Levitan. 


It snowed and snowed ,the whole world over,
Snow swept the world from end to end.
A candle burned on the table;
A candle burned.

As during summer midges swarm
To beat their wings against a flame
Out in the yard the snowflakes swarmed
To beat against the window pane

The blizzard sculptured on the glass
Designs of arrows and of whorls.
A candle burned on the table;
A candle burned.

Distorted shadows fell
Upon the lighted ceiling:
Shadows of crossed arms,
of crossed legs-
Of crossed destiny.

Two tiny shoes fell to the floor
And thudded.
A candle on a nightstand shed wax tears
Upon a dress.

All things vanished within
The snowy murk-white,hoary.
A candle burned on the table;
A candle burned.

A corner draft fluttered the flame
And the white fever of temptation
Upswept its angel wings that cast
A cruciform shadow

It snowed hard throughout the month
Of February, and almost constantly
A candle burned on the table;
A candle burned. 


Dark cloudy days, 
Cold and chilly
nights, 
Winter is finally
here, 
It is now that
time of year to
wear warm winter
clothes.

The rain turned
to snowflakes, 
Creating a white
blanket all over
the green earth, 
Lakes turned to
thick ice, 
Trees covered in
White snow.

Make yourself a
warm cup of tea
or even a cup of
apple cider, 
Enjoy every sip 
that you take, 
While you feel
the warmth of a
fireplace.

carols, 
Sing along and
allow the music
to uplift your
soul, 
soon be near.

poem, 
movie, 
Allow the spirit
help soothe your
soul and to chase
away those winter
night blues. 


Solemn and withdrawn, living on edges of tomorrow, having 
knowledge of depths of another world beyond this earth.

Wonder and curiosity lighting up inner skyways of my heart, 
as I listen to melodies of interior rhythms.

Slipping, sliding across ice of intellect, watching as it 
glitters and gleams in the winter of my mind and heart.

Being resurrected within the fire of my soul, burning so
brightly in the ebony darkness.

Snowflakes falling silently upon earth, reminding us of 

Always letting us know somehow that He's protecting all
of us on earth. 


The wind is whistling
the clouds are crying
the trees are dancing
the sun left us
 because winter is visiting us


Tomatoes rosy as perfect baby's buttocks, 
eggplants glossy as waxed fenders, 
purple neon flawless glistening 
peppers, pole beans fecund and fast 
growing as Jack's Viagra-sped stalk, 
big as truck tire zinnias that mildew 
will never wilt, roses weighing down 
a bush never touched by black spot, 
brave little fruit trees shouldering up 
their spotless ornaments of glass fruit: 

I lie on the couch under a blanket 
of seed catalogs ordering far 
too much. Sleet slides down 
the windows, a wind edged 
with ice knifes through every crack. 
Lie to me, sweet garden-mongers: 
I want to believe every promise, 
to trust in five pound tomatoes 
and dahlias brighter than the sun 
that was eaten by frost last week. 


Washing thoughts with a winter rain 
falling upon us.  

Watching it's intensity fill earth 
with it's flooding waters.  

Flowing out onto our desert floor 
that cannot absorb it all. 


A winter rose is very rare 
Whose delicate petals weep 
As the bitter north winds blows 
Them fiercely off to sleep 
They awaken from their slumber 
Beneath a warming sun
 
And rise to stretch in glory 
As a new day has begun 
The winter rose has flourished 
Through the passing time 
A symbol of life's passion 
And love that is sublime 
 
A new beginning, never to end 
A life's passion, deeper than the sea 
Embracing this thirsty soul 
Never to be separated again 
By the north wind blows.. 

this winter rose


Outcast of the Winter wind
A Rose fights for life and lingers on
But a bitter chill-has cast it's fill
And most of the gardens Roses are gone; 
But there 'tis one that remains
With a spirit-fighting to the very end
A Rose amongst the snows of time
Embraces the warm of love you send; 
So, if you should find yourself missing me
Just look out at the Garden Of Stone
And in the chill of a Winters unforgiving fill
A single Rose stands all alone; 
That would be me-waiting still
For the spirit of your warm aura e'er true
Fighting this iced chill-but with a mighty will
This single Rose 'tis waiting for you;

I live under summer's mercy
but no matter how much my skin profits from sun's warmth
no matter how much heat which I have been adapted to

my heart longs for winter's cold
and the snow (how it seduces me to take a risk) 
and gentle bites and vapour breaths

but

the weather demands surrender (not payment) 
and until I accept the cost I will stay
afire. 


To take a peek at her watch
She exclaims 'It's time', and gently release 
The light mist, cascading a slow and chilly freeze
The auburn Earth decked with frothy frost
Then, the blooms of snow come waltzing down
All the way downstairs, right from heaven to town
Like it's raining dandelion seeds
Pure, jolly and free
The lakes are armed with clear crystal capes
The world now awash with nothing but white
The gems of snow reflecting the sun's morning light


WINTER'S SPELL

Ended, hence, the glorious time of the sun’s lifespan, 
The trees were fully clothed, in leaves
Resilient, they had sung merrily
But now, all had gone-
With deserts of sadness 
.
What can a ball of cheese do? 
Up from the sky-
If it cannot fill the tummy of a poor man. 
The Moon covers the Earth down
Looking down at the rows of naked trees
With only a memory of leaves
Nipped by the frost, they want to be freed-
Ended up in the desolate stretches of snow
Eyes begged to see a scrap of light
But what it touched was a bare white Earth
His pale hands overworked
With no snow dogs they grieved. 
And his legs were totally numb
With not even a sledge to slide through-
He was the only piece of life-
In the land of the white
With just a star to guide him north
 Who put a spell on his fortune? 
Who gave him this curse? 
He shoved himself through the ice
Bewildered of his unpleasant fate
And at last his eyes found it for him
And far across, from the spells boundary
Stood a welcoming light for him
He ran with all his might
The home emerged larger
Running for food and shelter
He ran and looked through the windows
Marvellously lit decorated
Sat there in an armchair, a woman, old
With shelves of homemade thoughts to dust through
He knocked to get in
Opened it was by the women, 
Bewitchingly beautiful, she was 
The smile made melt down the things around
And he got in, leaving behind the spell
To live with her forever and ever and ever
That was the end of his fate
And from the windows he looked, 
To see the moon smile
                                          




With Robins and with Turtle doves a-calling
With drummer boys and carol singers too

The very essence of this time of year
The time for joy and endless family cheer
Not lost are those who need support and then
Find solace in the angriest of men

Even though at times their cupboards bare
And even when the odds are stacked too high
They manage to make happy people cry

Samaritans of everyone they touch
With warmth and comfort, mean so very much
Sometimes their anger reaches fever pitch

On New Year's Eve, resolutions seem just right
They're usually lost in sleep within a night
But just the very nature of those schemes
Can be tomorrow's everlasting dreams

A winter wonderland with snowflakes on the ground 
With friends and family gathered all around
And plenty of discussion around the hearth
And the blessings of one god across the earth


Sandy feelings grinding against me as waves crash
beneath the boardwalk at Seaside Heights, New 
Jersey.

Realizing the astounding beauty surrounding my 
essence in it's presence of moonlight, shining 
whitely against my softened skin.

Intensely sensing knowings being deducted in 
small parts of my mind.


Running along shorelines with wind blowing in my 
hair, sun shining wildly against my skin, warming 
me in the cold, brisk winter seaside air tonight.


Winter seclusion -
Listening, that evening,
To the rain in the mountain. 


Ice-chips plucked whole from the smoke,

the past week’s stars all frozen in flight,

Head over heels the skater’s club goes,

clinking its rink with the peal of night.


Step slow, slower, slow-er, skater,

pride carving its trace as you race by.

each turn’s a constellation cut there,

scratched by a skate in Norway’s sky.


The air is fettered in frozen iron.

Oh, skaters! There – it’s all the same,

that, like snake’s eyes set in ivory,

night’s on earth, a domino game:


that moon, a numb hound’s tongue

is there, frozen tight: that mouths like

the forgers of coins’ – are stung,

filled with lava of breathtaking ice. 


When against earth a wooden heel 
Clicks as loud as stone on steel, 
When stone turns flour instead of flakes, 
And frost bakes clay as fire bakes, 
When the hard-bitten fields at last 
Crack like iron flawed in the cast, 
When the world is wicked and cross and old, 
I long to be quit of the cruel cold.

Little birds like bubbles of glass 
Fly to other Americas, 
Birds as bright as sparkles of wine 
Fly in the nite to the Argentine, 
Birds of azure and flame-birds go 
To the tropical Gulf of Mexico: 
They chase the sun, they follow the heat, 
It is sweet in their bones, O sweet, sweet, sweet! 
It's not with them that I'd love to be, 
But under the roots of the balsam tree.

Just as the spiniest chestnut-burr 
Is lined within with the finest fur, 
So the stoney-walled, snow-roofed house 
Of every squirrel and mole and mouse 
Is lined with thistledown, sea-gull's feather, 
Velvet mullein-leaf, heaped together 
With balsam and juniper, dry and curled, 
Sweeter than anything else in the world.

O what a warm and darksome nest 
Where the wildest things are hidden to rest! 
It's there that I'd love to lie and sleep, 
Soft, soft, soft, and deep, deep, deep


Crystal palaces flowing imaginarily into a dreamy 
existence, showing dispositions of happiness.
Wandering hallways and corridors, finding treasures
hidden behind dust cloths of yesterday.
Removing spider webs from corners of visions, 
allowing perspective to shine on everything.
Taking darkness from it's hiding places, exposing 
images like rainbows in a winter snow. 


I was listening to the Robin singing high up in the tree
Signaling his whereabouts for all around to see
With a song so bright and wonderful it promised something more
And made that winter's day for me as I went back indoors


The browns, the olives, and the yellows died,
And were swept up to heaven; where they glowed
And when the land lay pale for them, pale-snowed,
Fell back, and down the snow-drifts flamed and flowed.

From off your face, into the winds of winter,
The sun-brown and the summer-gold are blowing;
But they shall gleam with spiritual glinter,
When paler beauty on your brows falls snowing,
And through those snows my looks shall be soft-going. 


You are so beautiful in winter! 
The field stretched on its back, near the horizon, 
and the trees stopped running from the winter wind.  
My nostrils tremble
and no scent
and no breeze
only the distant, icy smell
of the suns. 
How transparent your hands are in winter! 
And no one passes -
only the white suns revolve in quiet worship. 
and the thought spreads in circles
ringing the trees
in twos
in fours. 


I WENT out at night alone;
The young blood flowing beyond the sea
Seemed to have drenched my spirit's wings—
I bore my sorrow heavily.
But when I lifted up my head
From shadows shaken on the snow,
I saw Orion in the east
Burn steadily as long ago.
From windows in my father's house,
Dreaming my dreams on winter nights,
I watched Orion as a girl
Above another city's lights.
Years go, dreams go, and youth goes too,
The world's heart breaks beneath its wars,
All things are changed, save in the east
The faithful beauty of the stars. 


Stepping beyond fascination into realms of fantasy
and delight, introducing an interior beauty into
the light of yesterday.
Fruition increasing by increments as lightly as a
feather in a winter storm. 

All the complicated details 
of the attiring and 
the disattiring are completed! 
A liquid moon 
moves gently among 
the long branches. 
Thus having prepared their buds 
against a sure winter 
the wise trees 
stand sleeping in the cold. 


Leaning against the wind across the paddock ways
comes Dan home with forward stoop like a man bent and old,
and crooks his fingers to the blaze.

We do not live these days, but each exhausting day
unnerved we numbly wait return of life, and must abide
the wind, the still beleaguering wind; all voices else outside
imperioulsy it has blown away.

Over the bronze-brown paddocks the grass is bowed flat down;
along the birdless creek a cold malevolence has passed;
a forlorn sparrow clings on the fence against the icy blast,
his soft breast feathers loosely blown.

We watch the saplings buffeted without repose,
their foliage all on one side, plunging without rest,
stems leaning all one way from the assailing west,
bending as backs cower from blows.

The hunched cattle no longer feeding dejected stand
with dumb endurance, tails to the flogging wind hour after hour;
from some far frozen hell of winds a blind and souless power
invades and harries all the land.

The Wind! The Wind! It fumbles at the fastened panes,
fills, and posseses all, a tyranny without control;
ceaseless, changeless, malign, searching into the very soul,
the rushing desolation reigns. 


There are strange and mysterious sounds
When the winds of winter blow, 
The long nights are crystal clear and cold, 
And the fields and meadows are covered with snow.
The stars are frosty against the sky, 
And the wind's whistle is shrill, 
As the snow blows against the house
And drifts against the hill.
Yet, I like to see during the winter
A white carpet on the ground, 
To plod aimlessly in the deep snow, 
where deer tracks abound.
I like to feel the stillness
Of a crisp winter's night, 
Watching a full moon rise over the horizon, 
Exposing a winter wonderland beautiful and bright.


Wipe my tears
With your words
And keep writing
To console my mind! 

Oh! my friend! 
I will read again
And fill my mind
With your thoughts! 

We are alone
As we are apart
We are one
When we  are read! 

i weep again
And console myself
She is alone
In her journey! 

No money to spend
No job to spare
And let she live
With letters she find


In early years someone will wipe your bottom
In later years, someone will do that too
Maybe that’s because you have forgotten
To clean your ass after a number two


Now to those who search the deep,

Gleam of Hope
and 
Kindly Light,


Once, before you turn to sleep,
Breathe a message through the night.
Never doubt that they'll receive it.
Send it, once, and you'll believe it.

Wrecks that burn against the stars,
Decks where death is wallowing green,
Snare the breath among their spars,
Hear the flickering threads between,
Quick, through all the storms that blind them,
Quick with worlds that rush to find them.


Think you those aerial wires
Whisper more than spirits may ?
Think you that our strong desires
Touch no distance when we pray ?
Think you that no wings are flying
'Twixt the living and the dying ?

Inland, here, upon your knees,
You shall breathe from urgent lips,
Round the ships that guard your seas,
Fleet on fleet of angel ships ;
Yea, the guarded may so bless them .
That no terrors can distress them.

You shall guide the darkling prow,
Kneeling thus-and far inland-
You shall touch the storm-beat brow
Gently as a spirit-hand.
Even a blindfold prayer may speed them,
And a little child may lead them. 


This I say, and this I know:
  Love has seen the last of me.
Love's a trodden lane to woe,
  Love's a path to misery.

This I know, and knew before,
  This I tell you, of my years:
Hide your heart, and lock your door.
  Hell's afloat in lovers' tears.

Give your heart, and toss and moan;
  What a pretty fool you look!
I am sage, who sit alone;
  Here's my wool, and here's my book.

Look! A lad's a-waiting there,
  Tall he is and bold, and gay.
What the devil do I care
  What I know, and what I say


I start writing up 
But never reach to the deep of my heart 
Instead I am led to come to touch with a basket 
Full of of technique of the art 
I stitch a garland out of them and put it around my neck 
No transformation has taken place 
Inside I remain the same person 
Though I learn a lot 
And add up more to the account of my knowledge 
But they are not actually related with life and death 
Nor even they are in any way existential 
In fact they are arrogantly intellectual
Material of several books 
And I keep writing one after another like a fool 
Without knowing that I know nothing.
As knowledge is an entity which you can gather 
As much you want yet you remain ignorant 
In reality this is innocence 
You may know nothing but have reached to a point 
At which everything known 
And this is wisely called wisdom. 


We were all born foolish and dumb
Then we started speaking syllables bit by bit 
Then finally words and then sentences.
But most of our utterance were influenced by that of which we heard and listened.
In other words, the home in which we were brought up in.
If your mother and father were highly inclined then it's most likely you'll also be of same stature.
But does it make you of higher IQ than a man who was brought up in a home filled with null skulls? 
You might say for certain.
But what if that man whom did lived in the home of low stature were to be placed into a more highly intellectual oriented environment, what would you reckon? 
I'll say that his way of thinking and his cognitive capacity with improve.
It is wisdom not judge a man by his current position. 
Society will blatantly accept a man formally dressed over another in rugged attire, even though the man in rugged clothing has a higher intellect quantity or mannerism.
Society will also accept a woman with long hair and a beautiful body over one with pure heart and virtue.
It is wisdom not to be stereotype based on false premise
If the president presents a speech, it will in most instances be preferred over that of the voice of a normal citizen, even if the president's speech has no real substance, and on the other hand, the normal citizen has physical data to prove his/ her claim.
A sixteen year old girl has more prestige than a sixteen year old boy but a forty year old man has more prestige than a forty year old woman.
Why is that so? At sixteen a girl is at her peak in beauty and attractiveness but a typical guy is successful not until he is forty. With that understanding, as parents how will you lecture you kids on dating? 
Having multiple partners in dating will make you a whole lot more flexible but does wisdom despise reputation? 
A mother who makes all her teenage daughters decisions will one day pass away and her teenage daughter will grow into an indecisive adult.
But will you let you teenage daughter do as she please? 
Having sexual intercourse at a young age will give you more experience but is your life a job application? Wisdom teaches you to wait on the right person.
A labourer at minor age didn't went through the hardship of studying nights upon nights unlike a lawyer who did, but twenty years later the labourer would work ten times as hard as the lawyer would have to. Is there an easy way out in life? 
Wisdom teaches that the race is not for the swiftest.
If the weather is sunny will you carry an umbrella though there are chances that rain may still pour later on? 
Hardly anyone would, but everyone will carry around a cellphone even if they're not expecting any calls, it's the same in the perspective of passivity.


When I have ceased to break my wings 
Against the faultiness of things, 
And learned that compromises wait 
Behind each hardly opened gate, 
When I have looked Life in the eyes, 
Grown calm and very coldly wise, 
Life will have given me the Truth, 
And taken in exchange--my youth. 

That makes me a very Wise Man-

THE true faith discovered was
When painted panel, statuary.
Glass-mosaic, window-glass,
Amended what was told awry
By some peasant gospeller;
Swept the Sawdust from the floor
Of that working-carpenter.
Miracle had its playtime where
In damask clothed and on a seat
Chryselephantine, cedar-boarded,
His majestic Mother sat
Stitching at a purple hoarded
That He might be nobly breeched
In starry towers of Babylon
Noah's freshet never reached.
King Abundance got Him on
Innocence; and Wisdom He.
That cognomen sounded best
Considering what wild infancy
Drove horror from His Mother's breast. 


You worship them

Illness is a luxury you couldn’t have missed
Wealthiest people have it too

Failure is a stepping stone to achievement
Success is like a dessert
A sweet finishing

A good leader is to lead what you could lead
The rest is history

Don’t say no when you know that the no is a yes
It could cost you a fortune

Religion is not an excuse to kill your enemy
Use them as a tool to foster friendships

Define love
Love is like the Earth and the gravity
Inseparable

A good actor could not conceal his true behavior
It shows on his face

Death is a place to rest
Without your flesh and blood

A man is rich when he has all in places
Love, respect, friendships, happiness, admiration, honor

Don’t be upset when you had failed to achieve something
You could still make it, before you die

Between a woman and a mother
Both are the same, a life giver

Sadness is not a failure
But an honor to make amends

True love is a scarification
To be or not to be


There are some things in life are very poor,
And some unpriceable: our wisdom is
To know our rubbish and our riches here;
To, as it were, sort out ourselves, and blow
The world's dust off the jewels that we have,
Revealing them. 

Thanks GOODNESS 
For positioning the HEAD
High and up above the HEART

After writing a poem
Or reading a page
For better if you do not change
In behavior, in attitude
Then you add up nothing
On the column of your account of wisdom
Except volume and weight
By increasing the number of pages
Containing nothing but empty knowledge


I, 
oh no, you, 
I want to start not with I 
but with you

Feelings of love 
Eternal warmth is mine, 
No, yours and mine
Wisdom from above
Light will brightly shine
On me, 
On you and me


Becoming one, wisdom and love
Light and warmth melting in each other
Empathy and compassion, love
Humbleness and honesty, wisdom
Integrity and innocence, love
Justice, wisdom
Love and  wisdom all around
Warmth and light unite
For you and me, 
For us, 
Yes, we. 

We do not care-
That much is clear.
Not enough
Of us care
Anywhere.
We are not wise-
For that reason,
Mankind dies.
To think
Is much against
The will.
Better-
And easier-
To kill. 


Tapping into the universe, this mind finds a wealth of
information and ideas that are overflowing from within
it.

Cooperating and easily finding thoughts lying around, 
keeping my pen writing constantly, never letting up.

Living in a constant and incessant life of meaning 
and purpose, learning and being educated by an inner
intellect of absolute power provided by wisdom.

Always wondering and full of curiosity, giving portraits
of life an entire life of their own in landscapes that
are flowing with an immensity of knowledge.

A garden of blossoming ideas are filling the aromas of 
mindful images, measuring the amount of life through
rhythms and musical interludes.

Staying throughout this lifetime, precious, alive and
vibrant and always sprouting into this mind's intellect. 


Chopping in real time, invigorating my soul, feeling the melodies enter my imagination with verve and energy.
All the ambition of wisdom gathering itself in combinations I can easily write to.
Senses tingling, being disturbed in good ways as I am enlightened and led down pathways of entertainment. 


Checking aspects of wisdom, we falter sometimes, 
not realizing how very simple it really is.
Delving deeply into what we think is known, sends
confusion to cover our knowledge, causing us to 
forget what we don't know.
Seldom does anyone untangle facets of reality's
wisdom as it lies in books throughout our many
years on earth. 

Shocking minds into realms of foreign countries dwelling within.
Cascading lights penetrating the darkness, covering wisdom's
candles with frightening desires.
Overcoming obstacles along the way, 
reaching always for horizons beyond sight or seeing.
Waves lapping on edges of my mind, tantalizing memories into
imagination where they flourish and shine. 



Protect my children from troubles likely to face

One night I said to her: they are no more infants 
Able to take care where they live; grown ups

A smile so sweet and soft I found bloom on her face
Signal not strange to me when she presents her case! 

‘Grown ups who? You n’ me the children, no’ she mused: 
‘All infants to Him who protects, begin to end’

She doesn’t read too much or poems none she writes 
I submit all my whims before my wisdom wife.


It was obliged on my part
To be always a dream and part
But I failed to understand 
Why moon disappeared as friend? 

Nobody doubted moon in past
It was glorious scene to end fast
Why do silvery lines look dull? 
It needs to be lovable and full 

I saw no patches or spots
Even though there were reports
I tried to see only beautiful angle
Love to turn on later as beautiful triangle 

It gave me enough of coolness
Guaranteed full glow with happiness
There was reflection on face
Suddenly everything turned out of race

May be there are dark clouds
I see lightening and hear heavy sound
It shows wrath of some unhappy woman 
Desperately trying to call her self as human 

The gloom period may still expand readily
We may, for some more time, remain as unfriendly 
Time may prove as healing factor 
As it involves prestige and honor 

Destiny can not be decided by dream 
It is already decided by Him
Either with or without company
It may be then wish of almighty


Wish of Mother  Earth 

am the origin I am the shelter
Smallest of the particle and billions of lives
Nurture the existence, day night and every second
Don’t ruin me may not exist in the universe, for your cause

Clean you decorate you and beautify you all
Brings charm and fascination every day in your life 
Absorbs your wastes within my self
Don’t add more of grime 
May become ugly stinking and loose my grace. 

Provide food water and air, to run your life
Reciprocate me this much 
Could do my duties and obligations all the centuries ahead

Beautiful sky rivers Oceans and mountains
Are for your adventure amusement and recreation
Beautiful flowers trees and gardens
All adds fun play and pleasure in your life
Be this much kind, this beauty remain in abundance
For all the generations to come


You have acquired so much of knowledge
Shaken my limbs by exploding bombs on my surface
Don’t add more to my pain 
May become handicap and won’t be able to move 
Again will become hot and may find difficult to keep you survive


Sweetheart's sleeping face! 
Made faint sun-shine and moon-lit! 
Crossing light speed we need soon meet! 

Were talking that
came in her dream-
o baby
wish to embrace
wish to hugg
wish to have your your..
love so much that pure pure! 
The touch will free us sure sure!


Look-
Garden's flowers smilling
See-
Flock of angels for ever in flight! 
Just come! 
Just now! 
Me is only within you blowing right.

Enkindled me answered-
Yeap! comming.
Get ready just
wait a little.
Our meet a must.

Me risen from sleep.
Alas! 
Where she! 
Where me! 
It's an ocean in between! 
So how! 
Not now? 
Ah! allow me allow! 

Conscience sounds-
No, that power endowed yet
You are not nigh! 
Why? For what! Why! 
By no means
Don't forget hints.
You are a man
at best! Not you can-
‘Be’ and ‘it is’
Only the act of supremo HIS.
Dream-
As girl Alice were in wonderland.
You boy now so! Join hand.
Say, as her voice threw-
Strange! 
This is the new! 

Despite, for beloved call Me shout-
You nonsense Time, get out! 
Get lost thee! 
The Time mocking at me! 

Sleeplessness captured me.

The Time mocking at me! 
The Time mocking at me! 





Your voice, the sweetness
The depth of your eyes
Travelling emotions
I feel lonely 

Wish to say every night
I want you dear
Your chatting and talks
Cares and love
The swears and mistakes
Making you and I
You are with me dear.

Wish to say all time
I miss you honey
Presence and appearance
The mornings and nights
Your sense and my feeling
I have to say sorry
I will say love you honey
I will ever love you
Will miss you honey. 

Wisdom to see the difference 
Insight to know when to ask 
Selflessness to ask for all not one 
Hope that all comes to those who care 

Using the strength of your dreams
Pondering the power of a thought
Opening the doors to belief
Nurturing the love of your life

Always look to your heart

Stirring the joy of the time
Trusting the hope of us all
Answering the call from afar
Rejoicing in the result


Children, we likes them
Children, we love them
Children, we encourage them
To have a better future
To have a nicety of life
To have lot of opportunities
While they are grown
The ambitions are so big
In fact the world is progressed
Where children are prospered
Where they gets proper education
Proper guidance for a healthy living


I wish for such a lot of things
That never will come true —
And yet I want them all so much
I think they might, don't you?
I want a little kitty-cat
That's soft and tame and sweet,
And every day I watch and hope
I'll find one in the street.
But nursie says, 'Come, walk along,
'Don't stand and stare like that' —
I'm only looking hard and hard
To try to find my cat.
And then I want a blue balloon
That tries to fly away,
I thought if I wished hard enough
That it would come some day.
One time when I was in the park
I knew that it would be
Beside the big old clock at home
A-waiting there for me —
And soon as we got home again,
I hurried thro' the hall,
And looked beside the big old clock —
It wasn't there at all.
I think I'll never wish again —
But then, what shall I do?
The wishes are a lot of fun
Altho' they don't come true. 


She wished for a coat, you put your arms around her
She wished for a bracelet, you bound her
She wished for forever, you stayed on inside her
Just like you knew you would. 


Wishes for the beautiful homes
The comfortable dwelling houses
Though in sizes it small
But minimum facilities to all
Wishes for alleviation of poverty
In all households of the world
Where the deprived ones considered
Empowered, strengthened, educated
The purchasing power increased
Then the concept of family life
Makes them happy to lead a life
A valuable family life in the world.
Where poverty makes lot of problems
And disillusion in human minds
Virtues far away stands
Quarrels sometimes each other
Not knowing what the reason is. 


i wish them cramps.
i wish them a strange town
and the last tampon.
I wish them no 

i wish them one week early
and wearing a white skirt.
i wish them one week late.

later i wish them hot flashes 
and clots like you 
wouldn't believe. let the 
flashes come when they 
meet someone special. 
let the clots come 
when they want to.


let them think they have accepted 
arrogance in the universe, 
then bring them to gynecologists 
not unlike themselves. 



New year a peaceful year
A happy new year to all.
May the conflicts end
May the peace sustained
May the world ever happy
May it ever be proud
Happy new year, hopeful year. 


Childhood dreams sweet dreams
From dreams a castle built
A castle in sea shore sand
There the child dreamed a life
A life he dreamed of a king
A king of the heaven he pretended
Where divine powers existed
Beautiful children's clothes he got
The angels stitched the clothes
Different colors and in pictures
They helped him to wear it
The childhood dreams important
Their mind is full of hopes
Full of appreciation of the world
The heaven, the angels and fairies
Their tales from their grandmas
In the nights when they go for sleep
Childhood dreams, fearful dreams
Sees the demons, and cruelties
Their actions, atrocities on children
Sleepless nights he spends and cries.

Childhood, the great childhood
May it be safe and heavenly
For all the children of the world
A happy and prosperous childhood wishes. 

Soar higher and higher
Like a bird of limitless wingspan, 
Darting into horizons far! 
But they skim like web footed water birds, 
Tilting their wings in vain, 
Unable to fly to any desired destination
Helplessly watching loons and larks
Flying to the far edges of the sky

Sail across the limitless expanse
Like parting ships bound to distant lands
Carrying my fancies to the ends of the Earth! 
But they remain like paper boats
Set to sail by mischievous kids
That drift hither n’ thither on muddy puddles

 Wind their way down slopes and dales
Like a fountain stream running down
To join the sea, travelling miles.
But they slither like snakes, 
Struggling to move on polished floors

Grow out from chrysalis to butterflies
To flit around flowers and feed on nectar
But they ever remain such creepy worms
Destined to hide behind blades of leaves

How I wish, like an inspired artist
 I could paint on my canvas, with deft hands
The lustre and glory of the setting sun
The freshness and beauty of the spring flowers
The scary grandeur of the mountains
The silence of the lonesome lagoon
The dark majesty of the unlit groves
The sunlit glades of trackless forests
And scenes and sights, so varied and myriad
That I could array before you in magic shades 
The wonders of an unseen paradise


But, Alas! What I leave on my canvas
Is just a banal scene! 
Among the branches of trees
Are denied upward movement! 

Still I don’t regret my efforts
.

Like the lyrics of a half forgotten melody
In my sequestered hours of loneliness


The first purple wisteria 
I recall from boyhood hung 
on a wire outside the windows 
of the breakfast room next door 
at the home of Steve Pisaris. 
I loved his tall, skinny daughter, 
or so I thought, and I would wait 
beside the back door, prostrate, 
begging to be taken in. Perhaps 
it was only the flowers of spring 
with their sickening perfumes 
that had infected me. When Steve 
and Sophie and the three children 
packed up and made the move west, 
I went on spring after spring, 
leaden with desire, half-asleep, 
praying to die. Now I know 
those prayers were answered. 
That boy died, the brick houses 
deepened and darkened with rain, 
age, use, and finally closed 
their eyes and dreamed the sleep 
of California. I learned this 
only today. Wakened early 
in an empty house not lately 
battered by storms, I looked 
for nothing. On the surface 
of the rain barrel, the paled, 
shredded blossoms floated. 

WISHES left on your lips
The mark of their wings.
Regrets fly kites in your eyes. 

The poor child groaned
while his mother moaned
''Ah, he's possessed, 
ah, he's been bewitched'', 
she finally bemoaned.

To the witchdoctor she sped
and was back with murky potions
such yucky stinky lotions
those mythical concoctions


The woman obeyed the wily witchdoctor
Placed belief in that traditional healer
and the poor child still groaned
but his mama no longer moaned
After two days of treatment
and no lessening of predicament
she thought he needed
something more potent
When all it turned out to be
was a toothache! 


But she would hear of no dentist
like all quacks her witchdoctor
had fooled her five senses
for his spells and his chants
held her too in a trance
Quite a weird weirdo is he
Beware the medicine-man

Round about the couldron go:
In the poisones entrails throw.
Toad,that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Sweated venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first in the charmed pot.
Double,double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting,
Lizard's leg and howlet's wing.
For charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
Double,double toil and trouble;
Fire burn and couldron bubble.

Scale of dragon,tooth of wolf,
Witch's mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digg'd in the dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew;
Gall of goat; andslips of yew
silver'd in the moon's eclipse;
Nose of Turk, and Tartar's lips;
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-deliver'd by the drab,-
Make the gruel thick and slab:
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
For ingrediants of our cauldron.
Double,double toil and trouble,
Fire burn and cauldron bubble. 


Words shouting, singing, smiling, frowning--
            Sense lacking.
Ah, nothing, more obscure than Browning,
            Save blacking. 


If ever I dreamed of my dead name
High in the heart of London, unsurpassed
By Time for ever, and the Fugitive, Fame,
There seeking a long sanctuary at last,

I better that; and recollect with shame
How once I longed to hide it from life's heats
Under those holy cypresses, the same
That shade always the quiet place of Keats,

Of gravers scoring it with florid screed,
But let my death be memoried on this disc.
Wear it, sweet friend. Inscribe no date nor deed.
But may thy heart-beat kiss it night and day,
Until the name grow vague and wear away. 


With an old song
I can prove you wrong
With an old proverb
I can drive you berserk
Never forget the right verb
When you are at work
What goes up
Must come down
Like the sad frown
That the clever clown
Magically popped-up
You can go away
This summer day
With the new lover
Who will not stay forever
With you
You, too
Will be hurt tomorrow
Stand in a row
Like the stupid ducks
That the old sailor rocks
On a daily basis
Under the tent of the oasis
With an old song
I will prove you wrong. 


Of all the opry-houses then obtaining in the West
The one which Milton Tootle owned was, by all odds, the best;
Milt, being rich, was much too proud to run the thing alone,
So he hired an "acting manager," a gruff old man named Krone--
A stern, commanding man with piercing eyes and flowing beard,
And his voice assumed a thunderous tone when Jack and I appeared;
He said that Julius Caesar had been billed a week or so,
And would have to have some armies by the time he reached St. Jo!

O happy days, when Tragedy still winged an upward flight,
When actors wore tin helmets and cambric robes at night!
O happy days, when sounded in the public's rapturous ears
The creak of pasteboard armor and the clash of wooden spears!
O happy times for Jack and me and that one other supe
That then and there did constitute the noblest Roman's troop!
With togas, battle axes, shields, we made a dazzling show,
When we were Roman soldiers with Brutus in St. Jo!

We wheeled and filed and double-quicked wherever Brutus led,
The folks applauding what we did as much as what he said;
'T was work, indeed; yet Jack and I were willing to allow
'T was easier following Brutus than following father's plough;
And at each burst of cheering, our valor would increase--
We tramped a thousand miles that night, at fifty cents apiece!
For love of Art--not lust for gold--consumed us years ago,
When we were Roman soldiers with Brutus in St. Jo!

To-day, while walking in the Square, Jack Langrish says to me:
"My friend, the drama nowadays ain't what it used to be!
These farces and these comedies--how feebly they compare
With that mantle of the tragic art which Forrest used to wear!
My soul is warped with bitterness to think that you and I--
Co-heirs to immortality in seasons long gone by--
Now draw a paltry stipend from a Boston comic show,
We, who were Roman soldiers with Brutus in St. Jo!"

And so we talked and so we mused upon the whims of Fate
That had degraded Tragedy from its old, supreme estate;
And duly, at the Morton bar, we stigmatized the age
As sinfully subversive of the interests of the Stage!
For Jack and I were actors in the halcyon, palmy days
Long, long before the Hoyt school of farce became the craze;
Yet, as I now recall it, it was twenty years ago
That we were Roman soldiers with Brutus in St. Jo!

We were by birth descended from a race of farmer kings
Who had done eternal battle with grasshoppers and things;
But the Kansas farms grew tedious--we pined for that delight
We read of in the Clipper in the barber's shop by night!
We would be actors--Jack and I--and so we stole away
From our native spot, Wathena, one dull September day,
And started for Missouri--ah, little did we know
We were going to train as soldiers with Brutus in St. Jo!

Our army numbered three in all--Marc Antony's was four;
Our army hankered after fame, but Marc's was after gore!
And when we reached Philippi, at the outset we were met
With an inartistic gusto I can never quite forget.
For Antony's overwhelming force of thumpers seemed to be
Resolved to do "them Kansas jays"--and that meant Jack and me!
My lips were sealed but that it seems quite proper you should know
That Rome was nowhere in it at Philippi in St. Jo!


I've known the slow-consuming grief and ostentatious pain
Accruing 



Away out West I've witnessed Bandmann's peerless hardihood,
With Arthur Cambridge have I wrought where walking was not good;
In every phase of horror have I bravely borne my part,
And even on my uppers have I proudly stood for Art!
And, after all my suffering, it were not hard to show
That I got my allopathic dose with Brutus at St. Jo!

That army fell upon me in a most bewildering rage
And scattered me and mine upon that histrionic stage;
My toga rent, my helmet gone and smashed to smithereens,
They picked me up and hove me through whole centuries of scenes!
And fell from Arden forest into Juliet's painted tomb!
Oh, yes, I travelled far and fast that night, and I can show
The scars of honest wounds I got with Brutus in St. Jo!

Ah me, old Davenport is gone, of fickle fame forgot,
And Barrett sleeps forever in a much neglected spot;
Fred Warde, the papers tell me, in far woolly western lands
Still flaunts the banner of high Tragic Art at one-night stands;
And Jack and I, in Charley Hoyt's Bostonian dramas wreak
Our vengeance on creation at some eensty dolls per week.
By which you see that public taste has fallen mighty low
Since we fought as Roman soldiers with Brutus in St. Jo

Lay my rifle here beside me, set my Bible on my breast, 
  For a moment let the warning bugles cease; 
As the century is closing I am going to my rest, 
But loud through all the bugles rings a cadence in mine ear, 
  And on the winds my hopes of peace are strowed. 
Those winds that waft the voices that already I can hear 
  Of the rooi-baatjes singing on the road. 

Yes, the red-coats are returning, I can hear the steady tramp, 
  After twenty years of waiting, lulled to sleep, 
Since rank and file at Potchefstroom we hemmed them in their camp, 
  And cut them up at Bronkerspruit like sheep. 
They shelled us at Ingogo, but we galloped into range, 
  And we shot the British gunners where they showed. 
I guessed they would return to us, I knew the chance must change -- 
  Hark! the rooi-baatjes singing on the road! 

But now from snow-swept Canada, from India's torrid plains, 
  From lone Australian outposts, hither led, 
Obeying their commando, as they heard the bugle's strains, 
  The men in brown have joined the men in red. 
They come to find the colours at Majuba left and lost, 
  They come to pay us back the debt they owed; 
And I hear new voices lifted, and I see strange colours tossed, 
  'Mid the rooi-baatjes singing on the road. 

The old, old faiths must falter, and the old, old creeds must fail -- 
  I hear it in that distant murmur low -- 
The old, old order changes, and 'tis vain for us to rail, 
  The great world does not want us -- we must go. 
And veldt, and spruit, and kopje to the stranger will belong, 
  No more to trek before him we shall load; 
Too well, too well, I know it, for I hear it in the song 
  Of the rooi-baatjes singing on the road. 


Leave no stone

Leave no stone unturned
When you align to the tune
You sing in cuckoo's voice 
With deliverance in promise

Go for no opinion
You write with precision
Share poor's concern
Voice it in turn

You need to raise banner 
To provide it as healer
You are not here in search of friends
But for logical conclusion at an end 

People need not read
But understand
Your motive behind
And remain not blind 

You need to be good poet
And prefer not to be quiet
You have holy task on hand
To fight with pen till an end


The temporary illness
Made me unwilling to face
The cruelty of death
I feared each count of breathe

I am not novice
But not unwise too
The drop in Hemoglobin made me desperate
I became discouraged believed in lat day’s fate 

"It is temporary and may soon improve upon"
"Friends may visit and comment soon"
 From inside I was broken 
I sunk to a level and fallen further

I believe in destination
That is how I come closer to relation
I value friends and relatives
And remain not selective

You need someone all the times
Wife had been there with precious times
She may serve me despite her illness
I always find in her eyes real happiness

So such is human feeling
You get hurt when get ill or fail to sing
With whatever is in mind! 
I am once again on feet with demand


Try to raise your level
And feel well
For doing good
And meaning well understood

Humanity is for all o perform
As we are ill informed 
Know nothing about self and raise many questions
With self appraisal and predictions

It shall serve no purpose
If you suppose
And then come out with denials 
It must be treated as casual 

You need to be honest and directly deal
Leave out His part and perform
You shall always belong to same and form opinion

So, no "what", "if" and "but"
We should shut
The dogma that satisfies no one
But stays as single individual’s individual opinion


With desire

You shall
Make call
With desire
For someone here

It is beautiful bond
Compared as none to second
But still holy
And owned wholly

No one has done
Anything on it 
As to why it happens
But it takes place even 

We are forced to live
And believe
It is inescapable
For all people 

So we take decision
With precision
And after consideration
Go in for relation


With determination

I tried to hold old eyes
But failed despite earnest try 
I thought it better to lose old vision
Amidst fear and confusion 

So doctor advised me to go for
Lose old vision without feeling sore
I thought about leaves
And decided to live

May be good for me and readers
If I write with colored spectacles on 
To see the colored world
In it is new fold

What could I find? 
The and people were so kind
Eager to find solutions
With so much of good relations

I thanked doctor
For granting me new color
New vision
With determination


I was delighted
And excited 
At the news
With nice things to review

You are coming back
With sweet words at stake
As I was suspecting
But not reacting

We did not match
For lovely feeling to catch 
Now the time has come for decision
With no more point for confusion 

We loved so much
And card as such
What was missing in our link? 
Time was opportune too to sink the difference

"Can we bury the differences"? 
I caught her hand and requested to draw good inference 
She was all for the accommodation
I too was cordial relation 

We have now whole world to watch
Move around in happy mood to vouch
And present with ideas to move with happiness
It is pleasure to see lovely face


Deep conversation
With regards to bond and relation
Enhances prestige and position
With view to humanitarian condition

It gives deep insight
To feel wrong or right 
It is just delight to know
With openness, frankness without any show 

You will know about broad concept
That has been put into act 
We shall know the outcome
When come into contact with any one

It opens vast frontier
With views so clear
It opens new area for think tank
We can only express happiness and thank 

It is good to mingle
With different people 
They have attained high position after great struggle 
After all we are simple and human


Even though January is severe with cold
We are on top of world
The children are on roof top
We can't force them or stop

The kite season is on with fun fare
On h January shall be celebrated everywhere
The old and young all shall be kiting
The real fight between kite and thread shall be delighting

It is great occasion to watch
The religious fervor also catches
The sun I tilting towards North
From this day onwards, the sun shall alter the path

The cold shall be reduced
The season shall be balanced
People may have appetite to eat heavy and warm food
The vegetables are easily available and freely used 

We call it Makrasankranti*or festival of kites
It is real visible fight
People are taking full advantage of wind and cold
Entire state population is found on roof with different world


He aimed
To claim
First kill
But god had will

He was attacked
And injured
But left behind
Thinking he was  dead 

He escaped
And later on caped
As nice and capable
First field Marshall 

He used to laugh
With result half
But never left work
As half finished with word

Today we seek
Such Generals who can speak
Honest for the country
And seek the blessings from almighty

He repatriated 
And felicitated
All prisoners of war
With dignity and honor


Pleasure can’t be borrowed
But allowed freely
From anything that comes in natural way
And spreads the sway

Only love has that power
You are carried away in shower
The monsoon makes you wet
And seals your fate 

People say" you are in love’
And generally believe
That you have chosen path 
And shall stick up to last breathe 

It has all kinds of ups and down
It shall never be made known
You will know only when it has knocked the door
Y the time you shall be rolling on the floor 

You will know its real might
You shall be forc to surrender and not fight 
Love has its own color
With dignity, respect and honor


With disgrace

Say no
And order to go
Even by force
If it is irritant source

Retain
Pain
If that does not trouble
But make you know about people

Still be tolerant
And present
No inner conflict
You remain calm and strict

It will not stay
But go away
With sun rise
To your surprise

So lose no hope
And stop
Worrying all the day
The light shall show the sway 

You are the one to bear
And hear insulting words
So keep trust in lord
But not with sword

Nothing wills toy
If not earned in proper way
It shall land you in poverty
With disgrace from an almighty


The path has become long and unbearable
All common men are in jittery and with problems
With daily commodity prices soaring
Life has become hell and completely boring

It is easy to die than to live
No faith to keep at heart and believe
Poor man is forgotten and left to fate
No more good news can come even late 

It is their plight
They have to guide the flight 
Both the sides are tight 
No choice is given to go left or right 

Day passes under hot sun
No option open other than to run
It is difficult to make two ends meet
Where is the time to ask for others and greet? 

They can take care 
But do not know how to fare? 
Life is proving difficult
Each one has to face the insult 

Life has offered only pain
All energy goes in drain
Not enough is paid for labor 
Identity is at stake with dishonor

Even dogs have better treatment 
Rich take their care with happy moments
Who else is there on earth to ask for welfare? 
No place to have safe stay or take shelter


With divine words

Let us remain together 
And offer
An option
For maintaining good relation

Let us live
And believe
In humanity 
For elimination of poverty 

Let us not seek revenge
And avenge 
The past acts
That will take us many years back 


Never speak badly of any religion
In any of the region
But respect sentiments of people 
Without adding woes and troubles

Whatever may be the meaning? 
And means of defining 
Why then we mistrust anyone 

The human birth is precious 
That can make you known and famous
For noble work 
With divine words" is nothing but Ohm*
Constant reminder of them
The world really looks cheerful and fresh 


Even tiny particle has importance
It has its role to plat at once
Adding zero after figure may increase prosperity
Life may smile with security and stability

It represents foolishness too
To denote one’s unworthiness
Useless in life and of no real worth
They live life but with insignificant breathe 

" provides an opportunity 
To create new world with capacity
To show the world that there is something 
Which can be brought in life from nothing? 

The world represents big zero
We can be all important as hero
Each one is having memorable role
To lead a simple life with divinity call 



HE who has once been happy is for aye 
   Out of destruction's reach. His fortune then 
Holds nothing secret; and Eternity, 
   Which is a mystery to other men, 
Has like a woman given him its joy. 
   Time is his conquest. Life, if it should fret. 
Has paid him tribute. He can bear to die, 
   He who has once been happy! When I set 
The world before me and survey its range, 
   Its mean ambitions, its scant fantasies, 
The shreds of pleasure which for lack of change 
   Men wrap around them and call happiness, 
The poor delights which are the tale and sum 
Of the world's courage in its martyrdom; 

When I hear laughter from a tavern door, 
   When I see crowds agape and in the rain 
Watching on tiptoe and with stifled roar 
   To see a rocket fired or a bull slain, 
When misers handle gold, when orators 
   Touch strong men's hearts with glory till they weep, 
When cities deck their streets for barren wars 
   Which have laid waste their youth, and when I keep 
Calmly the count of my own life and see 
   On what poor stuff my manhood's dreams were fed 
Till I too learn'd what dole of vanity 
   Will serve a human soul for daily bread, 
--Then I remember that I once was young 
And lived with Esther the world's gods among. 


How shall I bid you good--bye,
Dear, without tears?
Only once in the years,
The idle vanishing years,
We met, with Eternity standing by,
And loved, a little forgotten space,
I for the sake of your beautiful face,
You I hardly know how or why,
Or whether you loved me indeed, alas,
With Eternity standing by.

We played our comedy parts,
Scene after scene.
I your lover and knave of hearts
Who kissed your hand in the make--believe
And looked for the bee in your royal sleeve,
And stopped, because of the pain that smarts,
The pangs that soften, the sighs that grieve,
And the rest of the tragic parts.

We did not know that we loved,
Not at the first of it.
That, ah that was the worst of it,
The aching sorrowful worst of it,
Not till I saw that your soul was moved
At the sound of my voice, as in tears I read
Of Guinevere and the days long dead,
And the knights and ladies who lived and loved
And went to their graves and were harvested.
Then, ah then, it was proved.

So I dare not bid you good--bye,
Dear, without tears.
Things there are in the years,
The coming ominous years,
All too sad for us not to cry.
Other joys shall forgotten be,
But not the pilgrimage made with me,
The Severn's flood and the angry sky,
And the love we talked of, which could not be
With Eternity standing by.


He owns the bird-songs of the hills--
The laughter of the April rills;
And his are all the diamonds set
In Morning's dewy coronet,--
And his the Dusk's first minted stars
That twinkle through the pasture-bars
And litter all the skies at night
With glittering scraps of silver light;--
The rainbow's bar, from rim to rim,
In beaten gold, belongs to him._The gentle breezes, 
that blow warm in you hair, 
is of the whispering winds of the words, 
of my passion, 
exhausted though my very breath, 
gentle pleas, cries of love, 
illusion of your beauty that gentle sways.

 
I flee to a  fairyland of love, 
softly spoken, and tenderly held, 
close to me from a world away, 
with no delay my dreams are sent
How, must I, contain-the-passion! 
a storm is brewing under the firefly flickers, 
in the twilight, star sparkle like pearls, 
oh, lonely orb, shine, shine! for me
my heart is a cyclone, that dances
in the pail light.


I'm man, I'm beast, 
No cold steel fence can hold me; 
but near to you I am weak, 
I'm only bound by warm gentle arms! 
and the thoughts are growing of a warm kiss.
And from there I wish to never be set free, 
from the arms of my-Angel! 


Love.  

With his venom 
irresistible 
and bittersweet 
 
that loosener 
of limbs, Love 
 
reptile-like 
strikes me down


We would climb the highest dune,
from there to gaze and come down:
the ocean was performing; 
we contributed our climb.

Waves leapfrogged and came
straight out of the storm.
What should our gaze mean?
Kit waited for me to decide.

Standing on such a hill,
what would you tell your child?
That was an absolute vista.
Those waves raced far, and cold.

'How far could you swim, Daddy,
in such a storm?'
'As far as was needed,' I said, 
and as I talked, I swam. 


All poets cannot imagine
Themselves Shakespearean! 
And all humans more divine! 
How to live loving within
The sacred doctrine 
Of ‘malice towards none’ 
Is a never ending 
Probing phenomenon
To us; we all humans-

To err is always human  
And to forgive is Divine alone! 
Homo sapiens and aliens
They are only our minds with in



Concerning your letter in which you ask
me to call a priest and in which you ask
me to wear The Cross that you enclose;
your own cross,
your dog-bitten cross,
no larger than a thumb,
small and wooden, no thorns, this rose -

I pray to its shadow,
that gray place
where it lies on your letter- deep, deep.
I detest my sins and I try to believe
in The Cross. I touch its tender hips, its dark jawed face,
its solid neck, its brown sleep.


True. There is
He is frozen to his bones like a chunk of beef.
How desperately he wanted to pull his arms in!
How desperately I touch his vertical and horizontal axes!
But I can't. Need is not quite belief.

All morning long
I have worn
your cross, hung with package string around my throat.
It tapped me lightly as a child's heart might,
tapping secondhand, softly waiting to be born.
Ruth, I cherish the letter you wrote.


My friend, my friend, I was born
doing reference work in sin, and born
confessing it. This is what poems are:
with mercy
for the greedy,
they are the tongue's wrangle,
the world's pottage, the rat's star. 


Time was the local poets sang their songs
Beneath their breath in terror of the thongs
I snapped about their shins. Though mild the stroke
Bards, like the conies, are 'a feeble folk,'
Fearing all noises but the one they make
Themselves-at which all other mortals quake.
Now from their cracked and disobedient throats,
Like rats from sewers scampering, their notes
Pour forth to move, where'er the season serves,
If not our legs to dance, at least our nerves;
As once a ram's-horn solo maddened all
The sober-minded stones in Jerich's wall.
A year's exemption from the critic's curse
Mends the bard's courage but impairs his verse.
Thus poolside frogs, when croaking in the night,
Are frayed to silence by a meteor's flight,
Or by the sudden plashing of a stone
From some adjacent cottage garden thrown,
But straight renew the song with double din
Whene'er the light goes out or man goes in.
Shall I with arms unbraced (my casque unlatched,
My falchion pawned, my buckler, too, attached)
Resume the cuishes and the broad cuirass,
Accomplishing my body all in brass,
And arm in battle royal to oppose
A village poet singing through the nose,
Or strolling troubadour his lyre who strums
With clumsy hand whose fingers all are thumbs?
No, let them rhyme; I fought them once before
And stilled their songs-but, Satan! how they swore!
Cuffed them upon the mouth whene'er their throats
They cleared for action with their sweetest notes;
Twisted their ears (they'd oft tormented mine)
And damned them roundly all along the line;
Clubbed the whole crew from the Parnassian slopes,
A wreck of broken heads and broken hopes!
What gained I so? I feathered every curse
Launched at the village bards with lilting verse.
The town approved and christened me (to show its
High admiration) 


With my Beloved I alone have been,
When secrets tenderer than evening airs 
Passed, and the Vision blest 
Was granted to my prayers, 
That crowned me, else obscure, with endless fame; 
The while amazed between 
His Beauty and His Majesty 
I stood in silent ecstasy 
Revealing that which o'er my spirit went and came.
Lo, in His face commingled 
Is every charm and grace; 
The whole of Beauty singled 
Into a perfect face 
Beholding Him would cry, 
I would watch dawn
over green fields.




Choose a quiet
place, a ruins, a house no more
a house,
under whose stone archway I stood
one day to duck the rain.

The roofless floor, vertical
studs, eight wood columns
supporting nothing,
two staircases careening to nowhere, all
make it seem

a sketch, notes to a house, a three-
dimensional grid negotiating
absences,
an idea
receding into indefinite rain,

or else that idea
emerging, skeletal
against the hammered sky, a
human thing, scoured seen clean
through from here to an iron heaven.

A place where things
were said and done,
there you can remember
what you need to
remember.  Melancholy is useful.  Bring yours.




There are no neighbors to wonder
who you are, 
what you might me doing
walking there,
stopping now and then

to touch a crumbling brick
or stand in a doorway
framed by the day.
No one has to know you
thing of another doorway

that framed the rain or news of war
depending on which way you faced.
You think of sea-roads and earth-roads
you traveled once, and always
in the same direction:  away.


You think
of a woman, a favorite
dress, your old father's breasts
the last time you saw him, his breath,
brief, the leaf

you've torn from a vine and which you hold now
to your cheek like a train ticket
or a piece of cloth, a little hand or a blade - 
it all depends
on the course of your memory.

It's a place
for those who own no place 
to correspond to ruins in the soul.
It's mine.
It's all yours. 


yes.  i heard 
your crispy voice
enough to give beats
to my resting senses

it feels so good
you couldn’t imagine
the joy you have given me
hope you do the same 

i wanted to listen more
as i journey to dreams
in my private paradise
where sweet words rise
like steam from newly cook rice
flirting to softness of breeze
i can’t wait to hear again
have a wonderful evening


WITH strawberries we filled a tray,
And then we drove away, away
Along the links beside the sea,
Where wave and wind were light and free,
And August felt as fresh as May.
And where the springy turf was gay
With thyme and balm and many a spray
Of wild roses, you tempted me
With strawberries.
A shadowy sail, silent and gray,
Stole like a ghost across the bay;
But none could hear me ask my fee,
And none could know what came to be.
Can sweethearts all their thirst allay
With strawberries

With big tin trumpet and little red drum,
Marching like soldiers, the children come!
It 's this way and that way they circle and file---
My! but that music of theirs is fine!
This way and that way, and after a while
They march straight into this heart of mine!
A sturdy old heart, but it has to succumb
To the blare of that trumpet and beat of that drum! 
Come on, little people, from cot and from hall---
This heart it hath welcome and room for you all!
It will sing you its songs and warm you with love,
As your dear little arms with my arms intertwine;
It will rock you away to the dreamland above---
Oh, a jolly old heart is this old heart of mine,
And jollier still is it bound to become
When you blow that big trumpet and beat that red drum! 
So come; though I see not his dear little face
And hear not his voice in this jubilant place,
I know he were happy to bid me enshrine
His memory deep in my heart with your play---
Ah me! but a love that is sweeter than mine
Holdeth my boy in its keeping to-day!
And my heart it is lonely---so, little folk, come,
March in and make merry with trumpet and drum


How trifling shall these gifts appear
 Among the splendid many
That loving friends now send to cheer
 Harvey and Ellen Jenney.

And yet these baubles symbolize
 A certain fond relation
That well beseems, as I surmise,
 This festive celebration.

Sweet friends of mine, be spoons once more,
 And with your tender cooing
Renew the keen delights of yore--
 The rapturous bliss of wooing.

What though that silver in your hair
 Tells of the years aflying?
'T is yours to mock at Time and Care
 With love that is undying.

In memory of this Day, dear friends,
 Accept the modest token
From one who with the bauble sends
 A love that can't be spoken. 

It fortifies my soul to know
That, though I perish, Truth is so:
That, howsoe'er I stray and range,
Whate'er I do, Thou dost not change.
I steadier step when I recall
That, if I slip, Thou dost not fall. 


You slammed the door and leave
tears crushing sadness indeed..
senses stop! like a paper drop! 
like a withered leaf felled in the ditch.
I call your name in a loud pitch..
but you never listen
pinpricks stuck to my veins..
now all was left is my empty pane..

Then I met someone new..
You bring back the colors to my day
added sunshine to my rays
You've kissed my troubles away..
You put meaning to my life again
with you my journey begin.
My fate, My love, My destiny
forever with you my baby


We haven't been talking for quite some time
But you, you've been all the time on my mind
The past is gone, the future to find
Life's like a record tape and you can't rewind

What will you do when the golden days are gone? 
Will the forsaken days always remain undone
Or can we revive this affection held back for so long? 

Please tell me without you there won't be as many days
Ahead for me as the many that made us part ways
My love, set in a daze, you set it ablaze
And I promise with you it forever stays


With you I am strong
Happy as can be
Every morning I wake up
I'm glad your next to me

With you I am everything
No one can measure up to me
Well, maybe one person
That's you, my sexy honey bee.

With you I am lively
My true self I can be
That's why I didn't wait too long
To ask you to marry me

With you I may argue
And most times I am wrong
I realize that I love you
So it never lasts too long

With you I feel like Superman
And your my Lois Lane
Because I love you so much
Not even kryptonite can bring me pain

I feel complete
Like I have nothing left to prove
And I will always feel that way
As long as I'm with you


If you use me as words
In your communication
I would be a silent receiver  
In your telephone.
If you perceive me 
As your entertainment
I would be your wristwatch.
If you don’t find me
To wake you up in morning sun
And in your sleepless night, 
Please tell me - then
I would be a day calendar 
In your hands every single day.



In the wee hours of a silent night
In my sleep I dreamt a dream
A lovely delightful dream
That took me to the land of love

In my dream, I saw my prince
His contours aflame with sparks of fire
His eyes dewy with liquid love
His lips quivering for a passionate kiss

But the cruel dawn came down
Sounding bugles across the silent sky
Spreading thick veils of separation
And tore his face from mine

Come, Oh Night! Come once again
Driven in the chariot of darkness
And bring him to the shelter of my arms
To wrap him in the warmth of my caresses
To enfold him in the tangles of my tresses
When the whole world, in deep slumber lies

Let me once more be blessed
With the dream of my heart’s delight
And be lost in that magic spell
Of his electric, enchanting presence
Which in the height of my passion
Was sullied by the light of dawn

Withering a leaves makes its journey to the sea, 
as the seashore begins its snore.
Sleeping at the destiny motel.
Can't remember the night you walked out that door. 


now another chapter begins.
o father I can't see the miles I've traveled.
o how the glistening bed of sweat on her forehead, send me to another dream.
Where once we were happy.
o how the time has lapsed.
A spell enters the court room.
As the judge leers at the room.
{cont.}Memories of pain, 
still droning on, 
to dampen the exuberance, 
of my faith in you, 
raging on my brittle defeats, 
you run over my silent desires, 
to celebrate, 
your day of, 
vicarious victory, 
and our vested tryst, 
limping along, 
desperate moments, 
fading into oblivion, 
and as i know, 
you're not as vile, 
as i thought,My beloved Country
When will peace prevail? 
When will induced rape and death be of the past? 
We harbor scars of our dead loved ones that we never buried 


Guard us beloved-for thy neighbors' honey isn't sweeter than ours
We are better within our boundaries 
The world is better with us there


He drew a straight line
Across the dirt floor:
Within, it was death-still--
Without, was a roar
And a scream of the trumpets:
Within, was a Word--
And a line drawn clean
By the sweep of a sword.
No help was coming, now--
That hope was done.
No more the free air,
no more the sun
Bright on the blue leagues
Of buffalo-clover.
Travis drew a line
And they all crossed over.
Travis had a wife at home,
Travis was young;
Travis had a little boy
Whose tight arms clung,
But Travis saw a far light
Shining before:
Travis drew a sword-cut
Across the dirt floor.

And now the old fort stands
Placid and dim,
Blinking and dreaming
Of them and of him;
And now past the Plaza
Other tides roar,
since Travis wrote "Valor"
Across the sand floor,
And the guns they will rust,
And the captains will go,
And an end come at last
To the wars that we know,
But as long as there travails
A Spirit in man,
In a war that was ancient
Before Time began,
Here will the brave come
To read a high Word--
Cut clean in the dust
By the stroke of a sword. 



Stay in hours of darkness
Until morning light
Help me through our baby's birth
And I will be alright.
Life's great happening to cherish
Be it girl or boy. 
Soon we'll hold a gentle child


Within the circuit of this plodding life
There enter moments of an azure hue,
Untarnished fair as is the violet
Or anemone, when the spring strews them
By some meandering rivulet, which make
The best philosophy untrue that aims
But to console man for his grievances
I have remembered when the winter came,
High in my chamber in the frosty nights,
When in the still light of the cheerful moon,
On every twig and rail and jutting spout,
The icy spears were adding to their length
Against the arrows of the coming sun,
How in the shimmering noon of summer past
Some unrecorded beam slanted across
The upland pastures where the Johnswort grew;
Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind,
The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag
Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill,
Which now through all its course stands still and dumb
Its own memorial,—purling at its play
Along the slopes, and through the meadows next,
Until its youthful sound was hushed at last
In the staid current of the lowland stream;
Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned,
And where the fieldfare followed in the rear,
When all the fields around lay bound and hoar
Beneath a thick integument of snow.
To go upon my winter's task again. 


Within this body
breathes the secret essence.
Within this body
beats the heart of the Vedas.

Within this body
shines the entire Universe,
     so the saints say.

Hermits, ascetics, celibates --
all are lost
seeking Him
     in endless guises.

Seers and sages perfectly parrot
     blinded by knowledge.

     Their pilgrimage,
     and fasting,
     and striving
but delude.
Despite their perfect practice,
they discover no destination.

Only the saints
who know the body's heart
have attained the Ultimate, O Tulsi.
     Realize this, and you've found your freedom.

     While teachers trapped in tradition
     know only the mirage
     in the mirror. 

WITHIN this earthen vessel are bowers and groves,
     and within it is the Creator:
Within this vessel are the seven oceans
      and the unnumbered stars.
The touchstone and the jewel-appraiser are within; 
      and within this vessel the Eternal soundeth,
      and the spring wells up.
Kabîr says:
         'Listen to me, my Friend! 


Earth shook, 
under terrible weight and shock
Tectonic plates slipped, 
Seismic waves gyrated, 
The Earth's crust punctured
crushing life and longings, 
The roofs came down.  
Dreams vanished just as 
air from a punctured balloon
The bread winners of the family, gone, 
Women and children, 
belongings and livestock, 
everything buried alive.
In the vortex of fury, 
nothing is left 
except, 
a pile of wrack and ruin

Trees uprooted, 
Everything scattered
like planets thrown out of orbits


Elements fell silent
under searing pain


No one, left to heave a sigh
or anyone to be traumatized
over the after shocks
‘Tout est complet'If I have erred in showing all my heart, 
And lost your favour by a lack of pride;
If standing like a beggar at your side 
With naked feet, I have forgot the art
Of those who bargain well in passion's mart,
And win the thing they want by what they hide;
Be mine the fault as mine the hope denied, 
Be mine the lover's and the loser's part. 

The sin, if sin it was, I do repent,
And take the penance on myself alone;
Yet after I have borne the punishment,
I shall not fear to stand before the throne
Of Love with open heart, and make this plea:
"At least I have not lied to her nor Thee!"


'A certain man has been abroad for many years; he is alone, and the god Poseidon keeps a hostile eye on him. Then after suffering storm and shipwreck, he comes home.'
               Aristotle's Summary of Homer's d Epic

In my mind's eye I see
Odysseus, the king with empty hands, 
stand by the great ship
glowing with his riches and legend.
The sun in Phaeacia blurs
ocean and land: shore and plain
converge with waves and winds.
Odysseus, on the day of departure, 
blinks into the wine-bright Aegean.
Time and again he turns craning
toward the sun, impatient for day's end, 
for the open sea. He no longer
needs to bear hope: Ithaca 
he can reach without effort.
He could do it in his sleep.

The Phaeacians spread a rug
and linen blanket on deck.
Odysseus embarks, lies down, 
lies still. They ferry his sleep
across the foaming purple night-sea.
Ghosts, busy with oars and sail, 
flit passed his dreamless eyes, 
as he surrenders, falls deeper
into the moon-life of sleep.
They pray his long-tried mind
will dissolve like sea-mist
engulfed in spreading sunlight.

At dawn they place him, 
still asleep, on his native shore.
In utter silence they leave 
him, a secret king alone
among ancestors and enemies, a man
equipped with the gods' own wisdom.
In the near distance
the gray-eyed goddess waits, 
without sleep, smiling
over his mortal needs.
She muses, 'Soon the sleeper
and his mission will be one.


'I cringe when I think about it: 
a life without her, 
Unbearable, disturbing, 
life would cease, 
as would time, 

her love is forever that of mine, 
she be this crimson heart, 
she be its beat, 
without her, I'd surley die..
can you live without a heart? 
I can't live without mine, 
she's my everything, 
she's worth every bit of time, 
In the end she'll never leave, 
she'll always be mine. 

Like a desert without rain, 
Like a mother without child, 
Like a temple without god, 
Is my life without her.
I will survive with her support, 
Like a parasite in a host.


Without leaps and imagination
we are really nothing.





Either at my friend's daughter's
sixteen-year-old body dumped
on the morgue slab, T-shirt
stuck fast to one ripped 
breast I identified quick, and then
got out of there

or at the old gentleman
with tubes in the living room, spittle
stained in his wispy 
beard, out of 
the corner of my eye I hardly
notice it, how

could I, drink in hand
at five-thirty, at the least
sign of pain one of us always itches
to turn away, another turns
over in sleep, groans
O, we who are so lucky

just to be able to
ignore, go back
quick, to our books, to
have books, even, how
difficult it is to look
hard and head
on has not been said

often enough, if prayer
is an act of attention
even to dropped stitches, blood
dangling beneath the lines, the
poem? I said,
what prepares us for what
will never save us?



Sincerity is everything
Eventually, truth will win.
Oh to own a peaceful heart, 
With conscience free from sin.

One false statement under Oath
Could be 'punishment bound'
Remember ~ perjury's a word
That carries a morbid sound.

Integrity flies upon the wing
Honesty will always pay. 
So let true hearts now enter in
To enjoy the pleasure of each sunny day. 

Without sexual attraction, there is
the brutal movement of the sea.
The face peers out of its skeletal frame
and hands reach like bone.

Without love, the streets
are hollow sounding
with wooden, hurried steps,
voices like caverns of death.
We pass each other as trains do,
whistling screams. 



Without warning 
as a whirlwind 
swoops on an oak 
Love shakes my heart



WITHOUT WORDS 

Without words 
There is a poem in me
I feel it about to come 
As words.
It is already here
These words now.
A poem that says, 
‘Life truly means something
When one feels a poem in oneself 
One can say 
In words.’Without you every morning would feel like going back to work after a holiday, 
Without you I couldn't stand the smell of the East Lancs Road, 
Without you ghost ferries would cross the Mersey manned by skeleton crews, 
Without you I'd probably feel happy and have more money and time and nothing to do with it, 
Without you I'd have to leave my stillborn poems on other people's doorsteps, wrapped in brown paper, 
Without you there'd never be sauce to put on sausage butties, 
Without you plastic flowers in shop windows would just be plastic flowers in shop windows, 
Without you I'd spend my summers picking morosley over the remains of train crashes, 
Without you white birds would wrench themselves free from my paintings and fly off dripping blood into the night, 
Without you green apples wouldn't taste greener, 
Without you Mothers wouldn't let their children play out after tea, 
Without you every musician in the world would forget how to play the blues, 
Without you Public Houses would be public again, 
Without you the Sunday Times colour suppliment would come out in black-and-white, 
Without you indifferent colonels would shrug their shoulders and press the button, 
Without you they's stop changing the flowers in Piccadilly Gardens, 
Without you Clark Kent would forget how to become Superman, 
Without you Sunshine Breakfast would only consist of Cornflakes, 
Without you there'd be no colour in Magic colouring books, 
Without you Mahler's h would only be performed by street musicians in derelict houses, 
Without you they'd forget to put the salt in every packet of crisps, 
Without you it would be an offence punishable by a fine of up to £or two months' imprisonment to be found in possession of curry powder, 
Without you riot police are massing in quiet sidestreets, 
Without you all streets would be one-way the other way, 
Without you there'd be no one to kiss goodnight when we quarrel, 
Without you the first martian to land would turn round and go away again, 
Without you they'd forget to change the weather, 
Without you blind men would sell unlucky heather, 
Without you there would be
no landscapes/no stations/no houses
no chipshops/no quiet villages/no seagulls
on beaches/no hopscotch on pavements/no night/no morning/
there'd be no city no country
Without you. 

my soul screams your name, 
my mind always thinks about you, 
my life is useless without you, 
without you im homless, 
without you im worthless, 
being around you is worth everything, 
the sight of you makes my heart race, 
my heart whispers your name, 
i'll do anything for you just to have you here with me. 

My Pillow gazes upon me at night
Empty as a gravestone;
I never thought it would be so bitter
To be alone,
Not to lie down asleep in your hair.

I lie alone in a silent house,
The hanging lamp darkened,
And gently stretch out my hands
To gather in yours,
And softly press my warm mouth
Toward you, and kiss myself, exhausted and weak-
Then suddenly I'm awake
And all around me the cold night grows still.
The star in the window shines clearly-
Where is your blond hair,
Where your sweet mouth?

Now I drink pain in every delight
And poison in every wine;
I never knew it would be so bitter
To be alone,
Alone, without you.


i wish i could hear your voice 
your voice is so angel-sweet.
every word you speak melts my heart and re-builds itself and re-melts again; a constant cycle.

my life without you wouldn't be a life at all.
i'd end it all.
i wouldn't be able to handle the fatal pain without you.
my heart is yours.

i'll never accept it back; there would be no use to it, making it useless.
and if it's useless what's the point in it? 
what's the point of my existance without you? 
this fatal thought makes me insanely scared.
please.
never go. 


Yesterday was our last. 
.  

and I never saw you. 
Yesterday started our past. 
.  

and I never had a clue. 

I'd call you
to tell you
I miss you, 
But I tore up your number. 

I'd drive to you
to show you
I'd kiss you, 
But I slashed my own tires. 

I thought I'd be sad
.  

but I'm not crying. 
I thought I'd be mad
.  

but I'm still smiling. 

So here I am, 
just fine without you. 
So here I stand, 
on my own two feet. 

Yesterday was our last
. . 

and I never saw you. 
Yesterday started our past
.  

and I never had a clue. 

A palace is but a shack
Limousine a jalopy
A tuxedo is but rags 
Gold is devalued to mud 
Riches are but poverty
A garden is a desert
Roses turn out to be thorns
The sun dances in the night
Health is pregnant with illness
Laughter gives birth to crying
Music gives birth to mourning
Gladness gives birth to groaning
Everything becomes nothing
Life is but death without You


Without you I am nothing
Alone, I'm boring and dull
Every night I thank the good lord
That I have you to hold

Without you I'm incomplete
Like a ball without a glove
I plan on spending the rest of my life
Giving you my love

Without you I'm always sad
Feeling all depressed and nappy
My number one goal in life
Is to always make you happy

Without you I have no soul 
No meaning in my life
Thats why I thank the good lord
Because everyday I get to call you my wife


I got to make it through without you, 
I so sad to say that how much I had missed you, 
I have mistreated you, 
Took you for granted, 
 I am sorry for what I have done, 
There is nothing I can do to make you stay, 
Just say that we may remain as friends, 
I am here without you, 
You are there having fun with someone you probably love, 
You probably don’t remember me, 
I once took people for granted without knowing the consequences, 
The consequences of hurt and pain, 
Without you I have made me strong but yet still missing you, 
there is nothing wrong with me, 
there is something I have to say, 
I am here with out you, 
I miss you terribly, 
But all is fair love is war. 


Without you  ~

I would never have known the bliss
that your tender kiss dost bring.
I would never have seen the heaven
that you have shown me, nor hear
the songs the angels sing.


Without you  ~

An emptiness, I would then possess 
the rest - of my life through.
I know not what, I would do then. 
I could never bare this sadness and
despair. My world would never be the
same again.


Without you  ~

The stars would no longer light the sky
and the moon above; without you an I
both there to gaze upon it - lovingly.
Would surely fall from up above and 
sink, beneath the sea - The darkness
then; 'twould be my only friend, 
my only company.  



A red deer steps out of the forest.
She stands in a pool of blue light
and watches the lake freeze.

The golden angel of the western sky
beats her vast wings slowly.
Her crystal tears
fall into the same lake

the deer watches.
I come to the shore of the lake.
I give it a name: 
Lake of the Yellow Moon.

I take the place into my memory.
The deer turns her head, 
slowly bites a leaf from an ash
and chews it deliberately.

Above me
the angel hovers over the freezing lake.
Beside me
the deer stands at the water's edge.

There is no wind.
There is no ripple.
I will wait here
as long as the deer and the angel. 


witness
 
on overcast days
apostate angels sneak out
on cumulus clouds    bear witness
from high grey pillowy heaps
they wear no wings    no halos
just ostrich-feather boas  
and - eyeglasses  
 
they peer down
on strikes  
by unmanned drones  
bodies twitching from nerve gas
prisoners tortured for their words
coughing children in the camp
and on and on and on and on
 
they don't sing together
they howl    out of tune    their tears
a rain that washes nothing
 
nothing


In the mid August, in the second year
of my First Polar Expedition, the snow and ice of winter
attempted to dash the sledge
along Crispin Bay, searching again for relics
of the Frankline Expedition. Now a storm blew,
and we turned back, and we struggled slowly
in snow, lest we depart land and venture onto ice
from which a sudden fog and thaw
would abandon us to the Providence
of the sea.

Near nightfall I thought I heard snarling behind us.
had followed us the last hour, and snapped their teeth
as if already feasting.
I carried the one cartridge only
in my riffle, since, approaching the second winter,
we rationed stores.

As it turned dark,
we could push no further, and made
camp in a corner of ice hummocks,
and the wolves stopped also, growling
just past the limits of vision,
coming closer, until I could hear
and remarked that the wolves appeared to be most hungry.
I raised my rifle, prepared to shoot the first that
ventured close, hoping
to frighten the other.

that the wolves were hungry, and laughed.
I feared that my old companion
was mad, here in the storm, among ice-hummocks,
in his pack, and extracted
two knives--turnoks, the Innuits called them--
which by great labor were sharpened, on both sides,
to the sharpness like the edge of a barber's razor,
and approached our dogs
and plunged both knives
into the body of our youngest dog
who had limped all day.

as he approached, then passed me,
carrying knives red with the gore of our dog--
who had yowled, moaned, and now lay
expired, surrounded
by curious cousins and uncles, possibly
hungry--and he trusted the knives
handle-down in the snow.


Immediately after he left the knives, the vague, gray
shape of wolves
turned solid, out of the darkness and the snow, and set ravenously
to licking blood from the honed steel.
the double-edge of the knives
so lacerated the tongues of the starved beasts
that their own blood poured
copiously forth
to replenish the dog's blood, and they ate
and held his sides
laughing.


And I laughed also, perhaps in relief that Providence had delivered us
yet again, or perhaps--under conditions of extremity--
far from Connecticut--finding there creatures
acutely ridiculous, so avid
to swallow their own blood. First one, and then the other
collapsed, dying,
bloodless in the snow black with their own blood,
his turnoks, and hacked lean meat
from the thigh of the larger wolf, which we ate
grateful, blessing the Creator, for we were hungry. 


I do not want to be reflective any more
Envying and despising unreflective things
Finding pathos in dogs and undeveloped handwriting
And young girls doing their hair and all the castles of sand
Flushed by the childrenaes bedtime, level with the shore.

The tide comes in and goes out again, I do not want
To be always stressing either its flux or its permanence, 
I do not want to be a tragic or philosophic chorus
But to keep my eye only on the nearer future
And after that let the sea flow over us.

Come then all of you, come closer, form a circle, 
Join hands and make believe that joined
Hands will keep away the wolves of water
Who howl along our coast. And be it assumed
That no one hears them among the talk and laughter. 


What can I do? 
What can I do 
To bring a chirpy gleam into the tired sunken eyes? 
What can I do 
To bring a smile on her dried up parched lips? 
What can I do
To ease the crease that has become a design on her forehead? 
What can I do
To brighten a hearty laugh? 


When the birds sing in chorus in the early hours of dawn, 
Chandini has no time to listen to the sweet twitter tee, 
She walks swiftly with pots on her head, 
For water!  She must fetch from a far off well.
As she walks back, she is reminded of another chore, 
A trip on foot to collect wood in the forest! 
Chandini rushes back carrying a bundle of dried twigs 
To cook food for her entire family! 

How can she aspire for a little time, 
Just to sit, relax, or stretch her aching legs, 
To stare at the trees and admire their leaves; 
She has to sweep, swab, dust her house, 
Wash clothes and utensils, 
So on it continues! The never ending chores! 
No siesta or respite from work, 
It is only work and work from dawn to dusk! 


What can I do 
To remind Chandini of her personal wants and aspirations? 
What can I do
To make Chandini realise that life is much more than chopping vegetables? 
What can I do
To tell Chandini that she is born not just to serve but to be served as well? 
What can I do 
To point out that Chandini too is entitled to little celebrations of  womanhood! 


I sing the song
of equality; 
In my view gender difference
is essentially a triviality.
Everything that is great in the world,
all the works, beneficial and good,
half must be credited to woman,
and to man half only we should.


All the vice or bad in the world,
and the pain or flowing tear,
for half, man should be blamed,
the other half only woman should bear.

Who belittles you as woman,
connecting you to Hell's flame? 
Tell him that for the first ever sin
not woman, but man must carry the blame.

Or, it may be that sin or Satan
is in reality neither man or woman; 
Satan is gender-neutral, so
it flows equally in woman or man.

All the flowers blossomed in the world,
and all the fruits grown,
isn't in beauty, nectar and fragrance of those
woman's contribution? 

Have you seen Taj Mahal's marble? 
It's spirit, have you seen? 
At the heart of it Momtaj, woman; 
outside is Shahjahan, the King and lover so keen.

The fortune of knowledge, or of music,
or, the fortune of all harvest,
woman's grace has made it so worthwhile,
flowing from every home and nest.

In the hardship of day and its scorching heat,
you can see reflection of man; 
in the soothing breeze
and in peace of night, who shines but woman? 

During the day she is source of strength.
She glows in affection at night; 
when man needs comfort and love,
her grace and sweetness flow to make his life bright.

With man behind the plough,
the crop field became bountiful, indeed; 
the greenery was only more beautiful,
as woman sowed the seed.

Man carries the plough, woman carries the water; 
from soil and water mixed together,
the crop grows in abundance,
ears of paddy - like blooming heather.

Of course, the metals -
gold and silver: ordinary otherwise; 
those become fancy jewelry 
with woman's touch that underlies.

In longing for woman, or in her communion,
man found where the poets' hearts belong,
as his words became poetry
and sounds turned into song.

Man's present - the passion; woman's is affection -
with the communion that hungry loves entail,
comes the children - all magnificent
from man the great that even angels hail.

All the great victory of the world
and all the grand voyages,
gained grandeur and nobility from sacrifice of
mothers, sisters, and wives, throughout the ages.

How much blood man has offered
is recorded in annals of history; 
how many women became widow -
No record of that - Is it a mystery? 

How many mothers poured their hearts,
and how many sisters did serve? 
the memorials of heroes - great or small
do not show that - do you not observe? 

Victory hasn't kissed man's sword,
because of the valor of man alone; 
the inspiration and pride woman brought
to men, that should also be known.

While king rules the kingdom
the misery and sadness go away,
joy and happiness her grace does bring.


Man! 
heartless, like a stone; 
to make human out of him,
woman gave half of her heart as loan.

All the great celebrities, immortal -
whose fame knows no bound; 
we celebrate in their memory
regularly, every year around.

They came to this world,
as at moment's passion they were fathered; 
but Raam found shelter in jungle,
while all the care and nurture Sita gathered.

Wasn't it the woman who taught baby-'men'
love mercy and compassion? 
Didn't she touch their eyes with kohl
as a shadow of her sad affection? 

Man paid that debt off
in a very strange way; 
holding on lap she who kissed him,
behind curtain and wall, she was put away.

Man the great; 
Is he so, really? 
who cuts open his mother's throat
at the command of his Muni father, bending his knee? 

In the world's bed, half the deity: woman
just turned the side; 
so far woman has taken enough,
now man will be confined.

Gone
is that age,
when man was the master
to enslave woman in his wish's cage.

This age is of empathy, of being human,
of equality is this new time; 
no one would be the other's prisoner -
don't you hear that chime? 

If man imprisons woman,
then the turn will come sure; 
in the same prison he built,
he will rot and die without a cure.

Take this lesson -
a wisdom always right and true,
if you make suffer someone,
suffering will catch up with you.

Listen! 
you the creature of this earth! 
the more you oppress others,
your humanness? gradually, there will be dearth.

In the dungeon of treasure
with jewelry of silver and gold,
who confined you, O woman,
who is that animal with heart so cold? 

No more agitation or bewilderment
to express yourself any more; 
now you are timid, vulnerable, and
speak only from behind the wall or door.

You can't look eye to eye, and still wear
bracelet and anklets - the prisoner's symbol; 
tear off the veil of yours, 
unchain yourself, it has taken enough toll.

The veil that made you timid,
let that go away; 
all those ornaments and symbols of servitude,
throw away, throw away.

Woman! 
To this world precious you really are! 
Don't roam in jungle or
to sing to trees you wander afar.

When did the Regent of Death come
flying on the wing of night's shade,
snatched you to captivity
in its dungeon where nobody can raid.

In that bondage of old time,
you are still living dead; 
from that time world's light is stolen
and our vision is obscure in dread.

Come like a lightening, O mother, 
breaking away from that pit; 
your broken grass bracelets
will keep your path lit.

The animal, that is man's hunger -
at the fling of your leg,
will dropp dead at your feet, and
together, with smashed undertaker, will earnestly beg.

Your ambrosia all of us enjoyed,
now different is the need,
the hand that offered ambrosia before
to the monsters must now offer hemlock, indeed.

Not very far
is that cherished day,
when with homage to man,
to woman also homage, the world will pay.



They said
You are my better half
Out of my rib you came
Bullshit, I say
You are the whole
You have never been half

Throw Adam to the winds
Eve was always full
All this talk about half and quarter
Coming off a rib whatever
Is just childish prattle
A woman is always full
As green as mother earth and lushly filled

My mom was full
A full woman all the while
No matter what my silly dad thought
No matter how many times she wept
Who would care what he felt
In his chauvinistic masculinity
That had no meaning
Beyond the hairs of his silly moustache
That greyed and died in time



We belong to a land
Where Mother reigns supreme
She stomps the heavens
As well as the earth below
She is the power
That creates the worlds
We call Her by a million names
And yet never are we satisfied


Woman, woman, woman
Mother, mother, mother
Get into the veins of men
Be their life-blood so
There always is a flow
Unto infinity
Unending procreativity


Oh woman, what is the world
Without you and your smile
Here are the flowers that I can find
From all over the earth
At your feet, never ever fret
Men know they can’t be
Without you on their left

Fools are they
Just forgive
For you are woman
You always forgive


Oh woman, what is the world
Without you and your smile
Here are the flowers that I can find
From all over the earth
At your feet, never ever fret
Men know they can’t be
Without you on their left

Fools are they
Just forgive
For you are woman
You always forgive


Show me a woman
That can turn a man with her hips
In the artistry of burlesque and belly
Show me a woman
That can be filled with pancakes
And fill a size dress
Show me a woman
Who can kiss you like spring
And color you like autumn
Show me a woman
That can hold you like a harbor
And scaffold your spirits with her hold
Show me a woman
That can collapse your knees
Even in the absence of a ring
Show me a woman
Who can wrench real tears 
And soak a cotton handkerchief
Show me a woman
That can fill you and empty you 
Like water to finite space
Show me a woman
That can surprise you like dawn
And undress your eyes with light
Show me a woman
Who will not dream of unborn babies
While making love to your body
Show me a woman
That will quench the man in you
And feed the boy within
Show me a woman
That will marinate your soul
And season your eyes
Show me a woman
That will unravel like a tube of toothpaste
Until all of her is naked within your soul
Show me a woman
That will crash like lightning
And howl like the wind
Show me a woman
That knows how to love like a child
In the absence of motive
Show me that woman
That will write your life’s script
With every drop of ink 
Of her cosmic endlessness


To  fulfil  immortality  in  life
Is  woman's  truth
Whose  sole deed is 
 To  disclose  us  to  ourselves, 
To  whom  next  to Almighty
All  owe  their  life
And  who  makes it  worth  having, 


Although  in  the  veil  of  desire
Is  but  lust  made  beauty, 
Nature's  agreeable  blunders
In  the  magnifying  glass  of  spite, 
Yet  no  man  is  whole  in  himself
Save  she's  the  rest  of  him.
What  puzzles  the  mind, 

Heart  can  understand only  by  love, 
Awareness  can  touch  only  by  virtue, 
So  rich  in  variety
Each  perfect  in  its  own  line-
light  of love  alive, home  in flesh, 
Revered  when  alive, 
Venerated  when  dead. 


A woman with words that would make you melt
A woman with poise, and had dealt
She had character, one of a kind
Had rhyme that would tangle your mind
.
She would try to be angry
But, never pulled that emotion past me
I would laugh at her thoughts
While at times feeling oh so lost
.
She could tell me how I felt
And my feelings would be a the tip of my tongue
This one lady had a very silly son
She would write so that her words you could hum
Lovely tunes that would flow off of your tongue
.
A woman who would take me back a step
She’s a special woman, I’m glad we met
Doubts would pass through my head
As she would take the stage tell of her meds
.
She was a mommy, had kids that probably knew
Their mommy was as special anything new
She had a light, couldn’t get away from it
She was so bright, a lady of pure might


Is it just because we're defenceless, 
or is it because we're young, 
that you always use violence against us
Should hat be the way it's done? 

Why doesn't anyone do anything
to help keep us alive? 
What will just a sorry bring? 
It won't spare the goodbyes.

One day it will have to stop
before it causes death
before it causes more tears to drop
before there's no one left.

Can't you just help us
and take the abuse away? 
'Cos just imagine life without us
if you killed us yesterday.

If you can hear our voices
and if you can feel our sorrow
we have the right to make choices
we have the right to live tomorrow

So come help us protect
the children of the future
and come help us reject
the childrens' abuser.


'Neath looming storm clouds, 
Stands stoically gracefull, 
Arms cossed and waiting, 
For her Wall Street suitor 
Who should have been there -
Twelve minutes ago; 
Anxiety rears, 
and it all begins. 

Tap.  Tap.  Tapping 
Her silver-tipped pump, 
On the cobblestone path, 
To the beat of impatience, 
Anxiously. .. 
'Til a grey flannel suit
Grabs her peripheral -
A young man trots past, 
But, it's not him. 
And, again it begins.
Anxiety.
as she silently pouts, 
And raising her wrist
Towards her Revlon eye's, 
She fixes her angst
On times eloquence -
She knows he's quite late, 
exactly twenty-one minutes; 
Movado never lies.


Twenty


Five minutes, 
Storm clouds approaching; 
A Glenn-Plaid suit, 
It must be him; 
'Til he walks on by. 
And that feeling returns, 
much stronger now. 

Pouting, now anger, 
Deep within herself, 
Yet, she keeps her stance poised
Though with great self-restraint, 
No angst or rancor - 
Will imbrue her pride.

Soon stormclouds blacken, 
Gathering great strength. 
Her eyes to the sky, 
Right foot, tap, tap, tapping, 
And with unconscious impulse, 
She begins to pace, 
With rapid stride, 
Pride loses its value 
As she stares at the cobblestone
pavement beneath her
counting fresh, tiny, raindrops. 

A thunderclap follows, 
She looks up to the sky, 
As raindrops fleck 
The tips of her hair, 
that she'd spent much money
styling, coiffing
at Balestri's Salon 

Just two hours ago. 

Then suddenly and ostensibly 
Between the raindrops - 
An arm reaches out, 
She spins in surprise; 
To see a warm smile 
curling at the corners. 
Her Suitor had arrived
With umbrella in one hand, 
Twelve roses, in the other.

And then she realised
She'd been early after all, 
In stark opposition 
To the vintaged belief, 
About Woman and Time. . 
Movado never Lies.

Woman
How do I begin to talk about me without taking it back to where it all began
The source
You only have to look at the fullness of her lips, 
The curves on her hips
My dark beautiful hair, my chocolate brown eyes
My lady long nails on my beautiful toes
To understand where her glorious princess gets all her goodness from
 
Woman
You fed me, you nursed me
You gifted me everything that these men see in me and want from me
A scale of through I can not start to comprehend how to rank this.  

Diva
But how can I

 
Woman
You remain, my fountain of knowledge
My guiding light
On your feet I rested, nestled close to you, and heed your every word
Your words are volume, they sounds loud and clear like a whistle
So when I speak, I speak in your words
 
Woman
You taught me the meaning of strength and how to hold it all together
In the face of adversity, you stood strong like an Iroko tree
Weathered the storm like a New Orlean
You labored, and paved the way, so that I may follow your path
So when I walk, I walk in your path

 
Many men want to see me soft like cotton
But I refuse
All you guys trying to get with me, fact check yourself
I represent strength and I represent knowledge
I should be considered the greatest woman of all time without a doubt
A self assured woman be I, I've become the envy of men
My appraisal of self is five star
 
A woman's worth is not just behind the curtains that would be a pity
Upon myself I've bestowed respect and dignity
If you are a real woman, then you better recognize your abilities
One by one we multiplied this city 
If we stand up for the rite values, we will represent strength


Baby I'm down to earth
but you're from another planet
way over in another galaxy
Baby you're in another solar system
way up high above me
Baby nobody can reach you
Because you're so
out of touch with reality
Baby you're speaking 
a language I have never heard before
A language I just don't understand
Baby you're much too sexy
for just one man
Baby the creature in you
has come alive
its hunger and its thirst
you cannot deprive:

That is my window. Just now
I have so softly wakened.
I thought that I would float.
How far does my life reach,
and where does the night begin

I could think that everything
was still me all around;
transparent like a crystal's
depths, darkened, mute.

I could keep even the stars
within me; so immense
my heart seems to me; so willingly
it let him go again.

whom I began perhaps to love, perhaps to hold.
Like something strange, undreamt-of,
my fate now gazes at me.

For what, then, am I stretched out
beneath this endlessness,
exuding fragrance like a meadow,
swayed this way and that,

calling out and frightened
that someone will hear the call,
and destined to disappear
inside some other life. 


What, madam, run for School Director? You?
And want my vote and influence? Well, well,
That beats me! Gad! where _are_ we drifting to?
In all my life I never have heard tell
Of such sublime presumption, and I smell
A nigger in the fence! Excuse me, madam;
We statesmen sometimes speak like the old Adam.

But now you mention it-well, well, who knows?
We might, that's certain, give the sex a show.
I have a cousin-teacher. I suppose
If I stand in and you 're elected-no?
You'll make no bargains? That's a pretty go!
But understand that school administration
Belongs to Politics, not Education.

We'll pass the teacher deal; but it were wise
To understand each other at the start.
You know my business-books and school supplies;
You'd hardly, if elected, have the heart
Some small advantage to deny me-part
Of all my profits to be yours. What? Stealing?
Please don't express yourself with so much feeling.

You pain me, truly. Now one question more.
Suppose a fair young man should ask a place
As teacher-would you (pardon) shut the door
Of the Department in his handsome face
Until-I know not how to put the case
Would you extort a kiss to pay your favor?

Well, well, we can't do business, I suspect:
A woman has no head for useful tricks.
My profitable offers you reject
And will not promise anything to fix
The opposition. That's not politics.
Good morning. Stay-I'm chaffing you, conceitedly.
Madam, I mean to vote for you-repeatedly. 


Woman in the night
singing songs to a lamp post, 
in her tight, haughty wrap, 
ornate spangled shiny glass, 
like Gruosi knock-off diamonds. 

Still, she dons the stoic glare
that once quenched the thirst 
of the midnight wolves.

Arms crossed, stiletto's spike 
'neath the poled spotlight, 
haute-couture from a genre
when phone-booths were built
like stand-up coffins.
 

And her desultory manner, 
of her social presentation, 
sardonically greeted  
by those who never knew her
from yesterday's.  long gone.

The scape no longer haute-couture
apparent to the avant-guarde
who rule the after midnite sweep, 
have their pick of the snatch.
They are the owners of the streets, now 
they've watched her stage wane for years, 
her futile battle with time.

And as this passion play pauses, 


on the corner of and h, 
theres' a buzz of Broadway goers, 
and the opulence that follows suit.
While just a shadow away, 
Woman in the night, 
humming Lou Reed tunes -
waiting for a reprise 
of ''Heroin'', 
or.  



But all thats been abated- 
with time and Maybelline; 
crinkles, cracks.  

in her 'come here' wink, 
crows-feet like fault-lines
that reflect each morning on smoked glass, 
that speak to her sadness with no restaint, 
no aesthetic mercy! 

For these times are gone forever, 
and the memories burn and scar- 
from years of wanton love, 
stories that she wears
on the frownlines of her face.
Because memories. . are just that, 
and left ''as that'', 
depress like veins in migraine. , 
from void.   

emptyness


SORROWEDNESS! 

Woman in the night
singing songs to a lamp post, 
waiting for a reprise of '''.
For Big Brother

Ziggy - 
his Spiders From Mars.
And she knows she'll never live 
those times again. 
still she freeze-frames it all 
in the Stardust of her mind -
Such is Life
  .  .

One day she'll pass
as so shall we, 
for Woman in the Night
in so many ways
not so different
than you and me.
So strange Life be.


Raving voices
Up raised fists
Marching on shoulder to shoulder
In the Front line 
Having slogans 
Your snapshots are invisible

May be your energy
To be advanced 
As a mountain of life

Being a mother and a wife
A sister and a friend
May be give a breath
To light up the torch

History of the struggle is
Not the struggle only of the men
But the picture of unseen and unwritten
Thousands stories behind

Capricious weakness
Image of the history
Until eliminate reality
It will be also a struggle
Within the struggle
You are invisible


Woman is a master plan
her design
extremely fine
Woman works her magic
never letting
things get out of hand
woman is a master plan
Every woman is a master plan
Every woman is a master plan
she knows right 
and she knows wrong
she knows when to come around
and she knows when to 
stay gone
Every woman is a master plan
Every woman is a master plan
she can make you lose sleep
and forget to eat
she can make you so dog-gone weak
but she's so dog-gone sweet
Woman is a master plan
Every woman is a Master plan


You have been loved, but WORSHIPED I'm doubtful, 
Kindness extended, and nice words just a mouthful? 

Many have felt love, in the head or in their pants, 

Worship is a strong word, today kind of rare, 
An old word, sounds lofty, and full of hot air? 


I'm here on Earth, 
 as a god I do stand! 
Here to re-educate women 
and especially man! 


Behold! 

Woman was made to be held up, toward heaven above, 
to be valued and polished, as fine gold- pure love! 

ALL of her thoughts, her movements, her actions, 
ALL miraculously perfect, angelic attractions! 

Her thoughts and her words, channeled from Source, 
Her ideas, feelings, gestures, perfectly on course! 

Her heart is the Avatar we need to gently uncover, 

She's not a human animal to be caught and then slaughtered, 

So dear man beast, where does that put you and your feelings? 
 Chasing female animals on the range, or at her altar kneeling? 

If you only could SEE her godliness and true grace, 
You'd come home from the range, repent and embrace! 

Throw down flower petals in her holy path, 
never direct toward her, your nasty wrath.

Bow at her feet, her life is a living altar divine, 
give into feminine wiles, leave your realm of swine.

Make her bed, fold her clothes, wash her dishes, 
give and keep giving into all of her wishes! 

Think not that you have to carry her along, 

Long will your days be, and full of her grace, 
Her ways will change you, behold her soft face! 

Her love will conquer you, unite nations and more, 
Unfathomable bliss, impossible not to love and adore! 

Worshiping women will always pay thee well, 
Making life on Earth a perfect Heaven not hell! 

Go!  Buy her chocolates, earrings and clothes, 


Woman, Oh woman
Why do you make me feel
Every time I'm near you
My heads a spinning wheel
 
Woman, Oh woman
What have you done to me
Woman, Oh woman
Did you cast a spell on me
 
Woman, Oh woman
When you touch me, I chill
When you kiss me, I'm in heaven
I've known nothing so real
 
Woman, Oh woman
When I gaze into your eyes
I'm blinded by the passion
I feel that's deep inside
 
Woman, Oh woman
Did you over do your spell
My hearts in many pieces
It sadens me to tell
 
Woman, Oh woman
What have you done to me
Woman, Oh woman
Did you cast a spell on me
 
Woman, Oh woman
In sadness I do tell
My hearts in tiny pieces
Did you over do your spell. 


have you ever wondered
what would be your condition
when you are proclaimed a witch
so terrible the experience may be
but dear reader, if you want to know
just travel to some villages of Bihar and Rajasthan, 
women are treated as if they were a witch
they are beaten endlessly, sometimes being killed, 
and people take pride doing this
are we living under better infrastructure, 
no my friend, it is a slur on the face of our country, 
we have to clean it with the passage of time.


A woman's is a sorry lot, 
As many a one would say; 
We do so many, many things
Invisible each day. 
Our hearts grow heavy with the load
Of success that's been ignored. 
'Impossible, ' you men would cry, 
'Why time has not been made
For us to go a-looking 
For all the things you say, 
For us to find those little things
And praise you to the sky.' 
But that is not what we would ask
Although it sounds that way: 
For if you'd see the good we do 
Each time that you are here, 
The many things that never show
Won't be so hard to bear. 
But if you're always finding fault 
And never see the good
We say it isn't worth it 
To please him if we could. 
And soon we won't admit our faults 
For that's already done
By men who've watched and counted
Every little one.


'Dearly loved, devoted Sita! daughter of a royal line,
Part we now, for years of wand'ring in the pathless woods is mine,

For my father, promise-fettered, to Kaikeyi yields the sway,
And she wills her son anointed,-fourteen years doth Rama stray,

But before I leave thee, Sita, in the wilderness to rove,
Yield me one more tender token of thy true and trustful love!

Serve my crowned brother, Sita, as a faithful, duteous dame,
Tell him not of Rama's virtues, tell him not of Rama's claim,

Since my royal father willeth,-Bharat shall be regent-heir,
Serve him with a loyal duty, serve him with obeisance fair,

Since my roval father willetb,-years of banishment be mine,
Brave in sorrow and in suffering, woman's brightest fame be thine

Keep thy fasts and vigils, Sita, while thy Rama is away,

To my father Dasa-ratha honour and obeisance pay,

Offer her thy consolation, be a daughter fond and true!

With a soothing soft endearment sweetly serve each royal dame,

Cherish Bharat and Satrughna with a sister's watchful love,
And a mother's true affection and a mother's kindness prove!

Listen, Sita, unto Bharat speak no heedless angry word,
He is monarch of Kosala and of Raghu's race is lord,

Crowned kings our willing service and our faithful duty own,
Dearest song they disinherit, cherish strangers near the throne!

Bharat's will with deep devotion and with faultless faith obey,
Truth and virtue on thy bosom ever hold their gentle sway,

And to please each dear relation, gentle Sita, be it thine,
Part we love! for years of wand'ring in the pathless woods is mine!'

Rama spake, and soft-eyed Sita, ever sweet in speech and word,
Stirred by loving woman's passion boldly answered thus her lord:

'Do I hear my husband rightly, are these words my Rama spake,
And her banished lord and husband will the wedded wife forsake?

Lightly I dismiss the counsel which my lord hath lightly said
For it ill beseems a warrior and my husband's princely grade;

For the faithful woman follows where her wedded lord may lead,
In the banishment of Rama, Sita's exile is decreed,

Sire nor son nor loving brother rules the wedded woman's state,
With her lord she falls or rises, with her consort courts her fate,

If the righteous son of Raghu wends to forests dark and drear,
Sita steps before her husband wild and thorny path to clear!

Like the tasted refuse water cast thy timid thoughts aside,
Take me to the pathless jungle, bid me by my lord abide,

Car and steed and gilded palace, vain are these to woman's life,
Dearer is her husband's shadow to the loved and loving wife!

For my mother often taught me and my father often spake,
That her home the wedded woman doth beside her husband make,

As the shadow to the substance, to her lord is faithful wife,
And she parts not from her consort till she parts with fleeting life!

Therefore bid me seek the jungle and in pathless forests roam,
Where the wild deer freely ranges and the tiger makes his home,

Happier than in father's mansions in the woods will Sita rove,
Waste no thought on home or kindred, nestling in her husband's love!

World-renowned is Rama's valour, fearless by her Rama's side,
Sita will still live and wander with a faithful woman's pride,

And the wild fruit she will gather from the fresh and fragrant wood,
And the food by Rama tasted shall be Sita's cherished food!

Bid me seek the sylvan greenwoods, wooded hills and plateaus high,
Limpid rills and crystal nullas as they softly ripple by,

And where in the lake of lotus tuneful ducks their plumage lave,
Let me with my loving Rama skim the cool translucent wave!

Years will pass in happy union,-happiest lot to woman given,-
Sita seeks not throne or empire, nor the brighter joys of heaven,

Heaven conceals not brighter mansions in its sunny fields of pride,
Where without her lord and husband faithful Sita would reside!

Therefore let me seek the jungle where the jungle-rangers rove,
Dearer than the royal palace, where I share my husband's love,

And my heart in sweet communion shall my Rama's wishes share,
And my wifely toil shall lighten Rama's load of woe and care!'

Vainly gentle Rama pleaded dangers of the jungle life,
Vainly spake of toil and trial to a true and tender wife

Holding in his radiant bosom fair Videha's sinless dame,

Not a curl upon her tresses, not a blossom on her brow,
Not a fibre of her mantle did with tarnished lustre glow!

Bade the sorrow-stricken Rama back his sinless wife to take:

'Ravan in his impious folly forced from thee thy faithful dame,
Guarded by her changeless virtue, Sita still remains the same,

Tempted oft by female Rakshas in the dark and dismal wood,
In her woe and in her sadness true to thee hath Sita stood,

Courted oft by royal Ravan in the forest far and lone,
True to wedded troth and virtue Sita thought of thee alone,

Pare is she in thought and action, pure and stainless, true and meek,
I, the witness of all actions, thus my sacred mandate speak!'

Rama's forehead was unclouded and a radiance lit his eye,
And his bosom heaved in gladness as he spake in accents high:

Never from the time I saw her in her maiden days of youth,
Have I doubted Sita's virtue, Sita's fixed and changeless truth,

I have known her ever sinless,-let the world her virtue know,

Ravan in his pride and passion conquered not a woman's love,
For the virtuous like the bright fire in their native radiance move,

Ravan in his rage and folly conquered not a faithful wife,
For like ray of sun unsullied is a righteous woman's life,

Be the wide world now a witness,-pure and stainless is my dame,
Rama shall not leave his consort till he leaves his righteous fame!'

In his tears the contrite Rama clasped her in a soft embrace,
And the fond forgiving Sita in his bosom hid her face


You do but jest, sir, and you jest not well,
How could the hand be enemy of the arm, 
Or seed and sod be rivals! How could light 
Feel jealousy of heat, plant of the leaf
Or competition dwell 'twixt lip and smile?
Are we not part and parcel of yourselves?
Like strands in one great braid we intertwine
And make the perfect whole. You could not be,
Unless we gave you birth; we are the soil
From which you sprang, yet sterile were that soil
Save as you planted. (Though in the Book we read
One woman bore a child with no man's aid
We find no record of a man-child born
Without the aid of woman! Fatherhood
Is but a small achievement at the best
While motherhood comprises heaven and hell.)
This ever-growing argument of sex
Is most unseemly, and devoid of sense.
Why waste more time in controversy, when
There is not time enough for all of love,
Our rightful occupation in this life.
Why prate of our defects, of where we fail
When just the story of our worth would need
Eternity for telling, and our best 
Development comes ever thro' your praise,
As through our praise you reach your highest self.
Oh! had you not been miser of your praise
And let our virtues be their own reward 
The old established, order of the world 
Would never have been changed. Small blame is ours 
For this unsexing of ourselves, and worse 
Effeminizing of the male. We were 
Content, sir, till you starved us, heart and brain. 
All we have done, or wise, or otherwise 
Traced to the root, was done for love of you. 
Let us taboo all vain comparisons, 
Companions, mates and comrades evermore; 
Two parts of one divinely ordained whole. 


Woman! when I behold thee flippant, vain, 
Inconstant, childish, proud, and full of fancies; 
Without that modest softening that enhances 
The downcast eye, repentant of the pain 
That its mild light creates to heal again: 
E'en then, elate, my spirit leaps, and prances, 
E'en then my soul with exultation dances 
For that to love, so long, I've dormant lain: 
But when I see thee meek, and kind, and tender, 
Heavens! how desperately do I adore 
Thy winning graces;--to be thy defender 
I hotly burn--to be a Calidore-- 
A very Red Cross Knight--a stout Leander-- 
Might I be loved by thee like these of yore. 

Light feet, dark violet eyes, and parted hair; 
Soft dimpled hands, white neck, and creamy breast, 
Are things on which the dazzled senses rest 
Till the fond, fixed eyes, forget they stare. 
From such fine pictures, heavens! I cannot dare 
To turn my admiration, though unpossess'd 
They be of what is worthy,--though not drest 
In lovely modesty, and virtues rare. 
Yet these I leave as thoughtless as a lark; 
These lures I straight forget--e'en ere I dine, 
Or thrice my palate moisten: but when I mark 
Such charms with mild intelligences shine, 
My ear is open like a greedy shark, 
To catch the tunings of a voice divine. 

Ah! who can e'er forget so fair a being? 
Who can forget her half retiring sweets? 
For man's protection. Surely the All-seeing, 
Who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing, 
Will never give him pinions, who intreats 
Such innocence to ruin,--who vilely cheats 
A dove-like bosom. In truth there is no freeing 
One's thoughts from such a beauty; when I hear 
A lay that once I saw her hand awake, 
Her form seems floating palpable, and near; 
Had I e'er seen her from an arbour take 
A dewy flower, oft would that hand appear, 
And o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake. 


There was a woman tore off a red velvet gown
And slashed the white skin of her right shoulder
And a crimson zigzag wrote a finger nail hurry.

There was a woman spoke six short words
And quit a life that was old to her
For a life that was new.

There was a woman swore an oath
And gave hoarse whisper to a prayer
And it was all over.

She was a thief and a whore and a kept woman,
She was a thing to be used and played with.
She wore an ancient scarlet sash.

The story is thin and wavering,
White as a face in the first apple blossoms,
White as a birch in the snow of a winter moon.

The story is never told.
There are white lips whisper alone.
There are red lips whisper alone.

In the cool of the old walls,
In the white of the old walls,
The red song is over. 


Your midriff sags toward your knees; 
your breast lie down in air, 
their nipples as uninvolved 
as warm starfish. 
You stand in your elastic case, 
still not giving up the new-born 
and the old-born cycle. 
Moving, you roll down the garment, 
down that pink snapper and hoarder, 
as your belly, soft as pudding, 
slops into the empty space; 
down, over the surgeon's careful mark, 
down over hips, those head cushions 
and mouth cushions, 
slow motion like a rolling pin, 
over crisp hairs, that amazing field 
that hides your genius from your patron; 
over thighs, thick as young pigs, 
over knees like saucers, 
over calves, polished as leather, 
down toward the feet. 
You pause for a moment, 
tying your ankles into knots. 
Now you rise, 
a city from the sea, 
born long before Alexandria was, 
into your redeeming skin. 


You, pretty Muse, with velvety skin
The sugary sap of my poetic pen
And the labyrinth of my soul
You inspire me and I love you.

You are my perennial spring smile
The garden of my ethereal flowers
The leitmotif of my dreams in exile
And the fictional oasis of the fall showers.

You are the guardian angel who's never absent
And the devoted hope with multifarious scent
You never say no. Oh! Eternal is your beauty.

Woman, Woman, Muse of St. Valentine
Your perfume seduces my whole being
And your maternal voice rocks me like a baby.


I've got the children to tend
The clothes to mend
The floor to mop
The food to shop
Then the chicken to fry
The baby to dry
I got company to feed
The garden to weed
I've got shirts to press
The tots to dress
The can to be cut
I gotta clean up this hut
Then see about the sick
And the cotton to pick.


Shine on me, sunshine
Rain on me, rain
Fall softly, dewdrops
And cool my brow again.

Storm, blow me from here
With your fiercest wind
Let me float across the sky
'Til I can rest again.

Fall gently, snowflakes
Cover me with white
Cold icy kisses and
Let me rest tonight.


Sun, rain, curving sky
Mountain, oceans, leaf and stone
Star shine, moon glow
You're all that I can call my own. 


She must be honest, both in thought and deed, 
Of generous impulse, and above all greed; 
Not seeking praise, or place, or power, or pelf, 
But life’s best blessings for her higher self, 
Which means the best for all.
            She must have faith, 
To make good friends of Trouble, Pain, and Death, 
And understand their message.
            She should be
As redolent with tender sympathy
As a rose is with fragrance.
            Cheerfulness
Should be her mantle, even though her dress
May be of Sorrow’s weaving.
            On her face
A loyal nature leaves its seal of grace, 
And chastity is in her atmosphere.
Not that chill chastity which seems austere
(Like untrod snow-peaks, lovely to behold
Till once attained – then barren, loveless, cold): 
But the white flame that feeds upon the soul
And lights the pathway to a peaceful goal.
A sense of humour, and a touch of mirth, 
To brighten up the shadowy spots of earth; 
And pride that passes evil – choosing good.
All these unite in perfect womanhood. 

She feels the world, it touches her
Like a weird thing she needs must know,
While all her fears and fancies stir
As in a death-dream long ago.
She has passed from her youth to this —
A woman grown with misty eyes,
Knowing the world no nunnery is
For the heart stripped of its disguise.
Her feet now pace a thorny path
Where mournful hopes like fiends confer,
And e'en the power her beauty hath
Seems one with what would ruin her. 


I want a woman
Akin to a tendril, 
As fragile as it could be, 
To fondle and humble
The way I did with my doll
When I was a child.

Also I want a woman
Akin to a wood, 
As sturdy as it could be, 
On who to rest and recline
The way I nestled onto
The lap of my mother.

In the company of the former
I feel I have conquered.
In the company of the latter
I feel I am secure.
The one who lacks either of whom
Is the one led astray.




The nudity is not an obscenity.
The nudity either in arts or in person
Is neither moral nor immoral.
To be naked is to be unashamed
And is in the realization of 
The bodily perfection and no more.
There must be no shame in the viewers’ eyes.
Femininity and sexuality
And motherhood are the female’s identity.
It is the male’s gaze that shapes a woman.
Breasts are motherhood; hips are fecundity.
She is the soil where men’s seed are grown. 
Face and limbs represent femininity.
In Tantra, woman is all in all.




! Womanliness

Observing without
Being observed
Is the womanliness.
Attending without
Embarrassing
Is the manliness.

Responding 
In concealment
Is the womanliness.
Advancing
Without bruising
Is the manliness.

Yielding
Without showing
Is the womanliness.
Reaching
Without betraying
Is the manliness.

Getting caught, 
As if by coercion, 
Is womanliness.
Sudden jump
With a pretence
Is manliness.

Will live long then
Their love
Though fruiting
Is accidental.
Mere flowering too
Is fragrant! 




.. 

the big WOMB! 

Yes Women here in life have those Sacred wombs to give the Birth, 

Yes the. Good Earth is. IS, A big womb like, 
for all the Nature, and creation it holds in its might! ! 
Just like how the protective layers in a Mother Cares for a child for months, 

this Earth has has very many layers too around it, protecting all the  creation and life! 

We do technology and pierce it with Rockets, Aircrafts destroying its layers, 
we know about OZONE layer yet we hardly care its Zone Haa! ! 

We do much Industrialization and push it with Gases many, 
We spill polluted water from factories on surface, lest it would absorb, 
We Hardly knew our ways and means as we Go, but want Air so superb! 

Also we get protected, with a very water  Layer around us we hardly know, 
this our Mother's womb Provides in immaculate way.

.. wonder how much is common  between Mother Earth and our very  Mother! 

Nature is Nature! 

 Oh No when we would learn what we are doing? 




Women Or they 
should be should be 
pedestals little horses 
moving those wooden 
pedestals sweet 
moving oldfashioned 
to the painted 
motions rocking 
of men horses 


the gladdest things in the toyroom 


The feelingly 
pegs and then 
of their unfeelingly 
ears To be 
so familiar joyfully 
and dear ridden 
to the trusting rockingly 
fists ridden until 
To be chafed the restored 


egos dismount and the legs stride away 


Immobile willing 
sweetlipped to be set 
sturdy into motion 
and smiling Women 
women should be 
should always pedestals 
be waiting to men


Alas! we women are the fools of you:
You mould us and you mar us — we are yours,
And ever have been since the birth of love,
Flowers cherished for a while, soon to be cast
As weeds away; and yet as weeds in the mire
Our fading hues breathe to the last of you. 




Women are no longer weak
They can speak
On any forum and at any time
Hold top positions anywhere and all the times 

All the venues are now made open
This change has not come all of sudden
They have proved their worth
And maintained till the last breath

In space and on the ground field
They have assertively held 
Proved their worth in economic forum 
So many top bank positions are now held by them 

Where people prefer to suicide
Women are in position to decide
How to handle delicate situation
And at home front maintain the cordial relation

By doing so effectively
They have come off really
Stunned all men folk with their determination
That course can be steered even in the deterioration


Women are delicate

Women are really delicate
Their work speaks or indicates
They are deserving lot
And lazily never caught

Exception can be everywhere
Even men come drunk and create furor
Create unsafe environment
And threaten employment atmosphere

So tackle if such things happen
But be quick and sudden
Address their problem
And happily bring them to table

See the work appearance
They put life once
Take work on hand
And send real message 

So women are equally enterprising 
And surprising
Their men folk in each field
They too have held high positions


Women are very kind and mild in nature
They are embodiment of love and keep us secured
Enough of tolerance power is rested with them 
We are careless and they are the one to take care of us and frame 

There are several instances reported about plight
Torture and cruelty committed on them with quarrel and fight
They remain helpless in the entire period and suffer
No one may side with them and at single point differ

Whatever may be their qualification and back ground
They prove weak in defense and helplessly found
Yet one can't escape the duty and responsibility 
Their silence is taken as weakness and poor quality 

Many brides are burnt alive for the want of material gain 
Husband and entire family members make her to suffer with pain
If she has poor father and brought nothing in dowry 
There are all chances and reason to lead to worry 

Such cruel stories are repeated in every age
Poor woman fall prey and unable to manage
It is tough time for them to face and manage 
Some of them come out successfully and write about courage 

Gents to suffer in some of the cases
Life is made hell with al odds to face
Rules are such to put him to be disadvantageous 
Their stories are circulated in print and make them famous

Life is meant to suffer if that runs in rough weather
We have to pull it under any circumstances together
Some difficulties may arise but it must be taken care of
Life should not be made impossible for others to see and laugh


Crazy mixed up is this place where 
we do dwell.
Rich is music passions winged 
flying on a swing.
Angels trumps singing choirs thus 
dancing on a whim.
Zoo in which all do play parts 
handed down to them.
Yellow haze softsymphony conductor 
does enjoy. 


Have you ever wondered, 
What do men look at when we pass by? 

Is it the wiggle in our walk or 
The twinkle in our eye? 

Maybe it is the cottage cheese in our thighs! 
No matter what those men want, 
I can not figure it out! 


The more I talk, 
The less I walk. 

No more do I walk past a bevy of men, 
No, not me, 
No not them! 

I can't have them stare, 
I'm a women of character, 
I'm not piece of meat, 
I'm not for sale, 
I'm not that cheap. 

However, if I were for sale, 
I couldn't be bought, 
Not for any price, 
Maybe, on second thought, 
I might reconsider, 
Here, is something to consider. 


As I walk past the next man I see, 
I know inside a woman is a wo man. 

Woman, Femme
Mujer, Mama
Soul, Ame
Fleur, Flora

Life is beautiful
With so many other wonderful
Languages



Throughout the ages
Women continue to be
The reasons why we are alive

I gave all women For their external
And their internal 
Beauty


They come under different name
At the end of the day, they are all the same
The Earth will always be round 
No matter what, no matter what sound
They express under stress 
They still clean our mess
Women are the best
Because they ace all of the tests.

The twilight turned ashy grey, 
Jet black with shining stars, 
Worn out by the rigors of the day, 
I retired to bed, unreachable depths, 
Eyes curtained by the lids, 
Pulled to deep slumber, absorbed and entangled; 

As minutes turned to hours, 
Trapped in the formidable world, 
I woke up with a jerk, wobbling, 
Saw a blurred figure of a lady; 
No.  


AN ANGEL with glorious fortune smile, 

Astonished and captured by her divinity and limpid eyes, 
I gazed with my eyes wide open, 
The doors ajar and windows shut, 
She bringing in a nebulous atmosphere, 
For she was no mortal woman, 
Her pursed lips ready to reveal
The glimpse of her turmoil, 
Ready for an arpeggio; 

With poise and divine voice asked she, 
'DO YOU HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE? 
Nobody had qualms in watching, 
The spectacle of my bottlenecks, 
The tussles of my life, 
Octopused and crushed in the hands of fate, 
My innocence humiliated in the turpitude of the world, 

Suppressed, downcast and trampled, 
My life ripped away by beasts, 
They laughed when i cried, 
My cries went unheeded, 
Dreams and thoughts burnt alive, 
BLOOMING BUD FROZEN TO DEATH, 
My child left with bleak future, 
As SHE SHARED MY G
ER; 

Now my tortured soul in heaven, 
In eternal tranquility, 
I chose not to reveal
But you endowed with my gender, 
Should rise and rock the universe, 
With the weapon of RENNAISSANCE, 
Should touch the sky with vigour and power


Said I, 
'Let your feet touch upon the earth again, 
You will be a panacea to all this suffering, 
Unfold and speak up with divine strength, 
Unveil your mask and rise again'


She vanished like a lightening, 
TO BE REBORN AGAIN, 
With perseverance as vast as this space.

Women need n empowerment
But endorsement
Of their being equal
To the gender called male

From the time of birth
Till death
Their position is undermined
The case has to be thoroughly examined

Still today, the girls are not preferred
And baby boy is always wished
In many cases they are aborted
And such incidences are really ill fated

Let us shame ourselves
How do we behave? 
Rape them in open
Pick them, strangulate and murder even 

Let them not wait for any organization
Concentrate on their strength and consolidation
The days are not far off when they will reign supreme
We all have to concede the point and consider them 

They are also not to be less blamed
Yes, atrocity is committed and falsely claimed
Many families are accused for harassment
But let us pray and wish that they succeed in heir drive for empowerment


Women for rights

Don't take away
Her womb in any way
This is her asset and treasure
Make it holy and say it not for pleasure

She demands nothing
Not even proper clothing
Not good food and shelter
Only keep her safe as guardian lover

What rights we can give? 
Just forgive mankind
For not honoring holy place
Where all have rights to claim for race? 

Can we speak against our mother? 
Can we trade abuses on her? 
What shall be out fate? 
Have we to hear from someone or get it very late? 


If any of the religion has script
Not to honor women outright
Kindly recite pages with care
Even so far, god has not even dared 

Let religious head
Concentrate and read
Sacred hymns 
And express concern 

Pronounce verdict
If they are addict
Bring dishonor to women
Bury them live underground even


The habit, is so easily dropped.
Thus picked, is man's will poor. 

Women I adore
Every opportunity I explore
To praise them in their work
Not with pleasing attitude but with honest words

I will not say that each woman reflect mother
But I will certainly say that they are no others
But real origin from where we are today
They need to be honored by all the way

Let sisters play their role
Let wife respond different call
But in all mothers are different
If not more but I praise them at present

Men may break any time
Loose patience sometimes
But woman may always stand by
Render all assistance and try

I bow head for their tolerance
Hard work and dedication for lovely presence
She can go for any ordeal
As her emotions are real

They have different role to play
In any position they stay supreme 
No one can take away their position
They have kind heart with mild composition


Woman in nature

Give honor
And adore
As mother
Or sister

She is creator
And good orator 
At home
And always welcome


Think of universe
With impartial opinion of course
What have we done to her? 
Not only shamed but dithered

Does she deserve same? 
As we claim
High status for her sacrifice
We need to reiterate and promise

If you can't tolerate her presence
And reject at once
How are we going to care for nation? 
Where thousands of such women are
Waiting for our approval with honor


Make some difference
And treat her once
Like status in nature
And secure future


Beauty is called no beauty
Until it has blessings of an almighty
That is graceful appearance
Elegant show in sun's presence 

Flowers no which side to go
Tilt and blow
With air to have natural test
Live in own pride and feel best 

World may think otherwise
But beautiful women and flowers are wise
Do not land up in problem
Unless convinced with full struggle 

Woman may see no poverty
She will go for heart's beauty
The giant size of place to enter
And stay forever 

Women know
How to flow
Like river water move
Silently in love and prove 

So do not crush flowers
As they are followers
Of love and simple show
Allow them to mushroom with wind's flow


Women like you. 
Will have nothing to do with me.
Between the top and the bottom 
the searing heat.
Just as I am unlike the rest of you.
I can have nothing to do 
with women of the likes of you. 


She knows how to carry herself
 She knows how to handle any situation
 for experienced teach  her more lessons to be brave
 She is full of confidence and speaks from the heart..

 At this age beauty fully developed inside and out
 She is content with her desire. 
 for she knows HAPPINESS IS A CHOICE.


Paper moon of pink flesh
grown heady and deep, 
Full bodied yet shinning
Influencing all women.  

Graceful in movment..
Dancing the light away, still always breathing


Most women poet's are soft, 
And claim 
That they like a man that is hard.
A few take, 
to long to properly develop him.
He fall's asleep, 
On her hand.
With her soft hand she can stir, 
Him on up to the top.
She is cunning and amused, 
And a mist then cover's the land. 



IT IS NOT MEN
BUT ONLY WOMEN
THAT CARRIES THE SHOW
WHEN WE FERALESSLY GROW
WITH PEACEFUL CALM WATER IT FLOW
NEVER RETALITATE IN ANGER OR OFFER A BLOW
WHY NOT ACCCEPT HER GRACEFUL GESTURE AND BOW? 
GIVEW HER ALL THE DUES ANED NEVER REGRET OR BE LITTLE SLOW
SHE MAY NOT COME IN YOUR WAY OR BEAT AN EYE BROW
WHATEVER MAYBE THE REASON BUT SHE WILL FOLLOW
YOU MAY HAVE EVERY REASON TO FIND A GLOW
SHE WILL ACCEPT ALL ABUSES YOU THROW
SHE IS HOLY BUT NOT SACRED COW 
ALLOW HER FREEDON AND GROW
SHE IS SPECIAL ENTITY NOW
YOU KNOW IT ANY HOW
NEVER LOOK BELOW
FIND IT NOW
IN ROW
HOW? 
DON’T FIGHT
GRANT THE RIGHTS
SUN MAY SHINE WITH LIGHT
NO DEVIATION, NOT EVEN SLIGHT
EVERYTHING WILL BE GOOD AND ALRIGHT
JUST HOLD YOUR BREATH AND CORRECT THE SIGHT
JUST LITTLE CORRECTION FORWRONG TO EXACTLY RIGHT
YOU MAY GAIN STRENGTH AS THE MIDDAY RISES WITH HEIGHT 
I SHALL SLOW DOWN IN MY UTTERENCES AND REITERATE
I LOVE WOMAN, STAND BY THEM AND CORROBORATE
HEIGHLIGHT THEIR STRUGGLE AND NARRATE
HUMBLY SUR
ER AND SIMPLY STATE
IT IS BETTER LATE THAN NEVER LATE
WARM RECEIPTION AND NOT HATE
I APPRICAITE AND HIGHLY RATE
HAVE WE TO WATCH N WAIT? 
RELENT AND DO IT
LIGHT TO LIGHT
SUBMIT


You cannot rob us of the rights we cherish,
Nor turn our thoughts away
From the bright picture of a "Woman's Mission"
Our hearts portray.

We claim to dwell, in quiet and seclusion,
Beneath the household roof,--
From the great world's harsh strife, and jarring voices,
To stand aloof;--

Not in a dreamy and inane abstraction
To sleep our life away,
But, gathering up the brightness of home sunshine,
To deck our way.

As humble plants by country hedgerows growing,
That treasure up the rain,
And yield in odours, ere the day's declining,
The gift again;

So let us, unobtrusive and unnoticed,
But happy none the less,
Be privileged to fill the air around us
With happiness;

To live, unknown beyond the cherished circle,
Which we can bless and aid;
To die, and not a heart that does not love us
Know where we're laid. 


Fellow men! why should the lords try to despise
And prohibit women from having the benefit of the parliamentary Franchise?
When they pay the same taxes as you and me,
I consider they ought to have the same liberty. 

And I consider if they are not allowed the same liberty,
From taxation every one of them should be set free;
And if they are not, it is really very unfair,
And an act of injustice I most solemnly declare. 

Women, farmers, have no protection as the law now stands;
And many of them have lost their property and lands,
And have been turned out of their beautiful farms
By the unjust laws of the land and the sheriffs' alarms. 

And in my opinion, such treatment is very cruel;
And fair play, 'tis said, is a precious jewel;
But such treatment causes women to fret and to dote,
Because they are deprived of the parliamentary Franchise vote. 

In my opinion, what a man pays for he certainly should get;
And if he does not, he will certainly fret;
And why wouldn't women do the very same?
Therefore, to demand the parliamentary Franchise they are not to blame. 

Therefore let them gather, and demand the parliamentary Franchise;
And I'm sure no reasonable man will their actions despise,
For trying to obtain the privileges most unjustly withheld from them;
Which Mr. Gladstone will certainly encourage and never condemn. 

And as for the working women, many are driven to the point of starvation,
All through the tendency of the legislation;
Besides, upon members of parliament they have no claim
As a deputation, which is a very great shame. 

Yes, the Home Secretary of the present day,
Against working women's deputations, has always said- nay;
Because they haven't got the parliamentary Franchise-,
That is the reason why he does them despise. 

And that, in my opinion, is really very unjust;
But the time is not far distant, I most earnestly trust,
When women will have a parliamentary vote,
And many of them, I hope, will wear a better petticoat. 

And enable them to obtain the parliamentary Franchise;
And rally together, and make a bold stand,
And demand the parliamentary Franchise throughout Scotland. 

And do not rest day nor night-
Because your demands are only right
And Heaven, I'm sure, will defend the right. 

Therefore go on brave women! and never fear,
Although your case may seem dark and drear,
And ye will gain the parliamentary Franchise before very long. 


A snake my eat your toe but it can't
Swollow it.
It may worry at your lips with blind
White eyes.
One may slide between your legs when
Your asleep.
One will try to drink the milk from the
Tip of your left breast.
Bushes without leaves to see exposed.
The snake can be a woman's friend when
It's never Left alone. 


weapons of mass destruction
But! Women! Men's destruction.
They attract you with their looks and charms
And bodies that will put you in " self destruct".
But to them that’s not enough.

They want to control your mind from
Now till the end of time.
Like a hamster in a play pen
With a beginning but no end.

You climb on that "spinning wheel of life"
And run like hell
While they watch and laugh
And ring that bell.

They are truly men s destruction! 
And I think that’s the way it will always be.




No parallel to exist on this beautiful earth
Than to trust women till their death
What are they doing on this lovely world? 
Not with full freedom yet not completely also sold

How to paint her more than a rose? 
What to miss and what not to suppose
What rose has specially and that she does not have? 
Nature has gifted her more then generally rose behaves

What life span rose has in entire day? 
Limited show with fragrance and that too go away
What woman has and to present it in entire span? 
Lovely to look and besides stay in fray without any plan

Both are so delicate to handle 
No possible way can be found out in middle
Little negligence and beauty is simply spoiled
Both are of little shy nature and spontaneously coiled

She can be mother, wife and daughter
But the term is loyally sought after 
She is held with cast aspirations
In all the respect she has high relations

Nothing to miss and nothing to tease
She is there to make life at ease
Whether with morning cool breeze
Or in severe winter when bones freeze


They have painted and sung
the women washing their hair,
and the plaits and strands in the sun,
and the golden combs
and the combs of elephant tusks
and the combs of buffalo horn and hoof.


The sun has been good to women,
drying their heads of hair
as they stooped and shook their shoulders
and framed their faces with copper
and framed their eyes with dusk or chestnut.

The rain has been good to women.
If the rain should forget,
if the rain left off for a year—
the heads of women would wither,
the copper, the dusk and chestnuts, go.

They have painted and sung
the women washing their hair—
reckon the sun and rain in, too. 




Barbara's eyes are blue as azure,
But she is in love with Freddy.
Karen's sweet, but Harry has her.
Gentle Jane is going steady.
Carol hates me. So does May.
Abigail will not be mine.
Nancy lives too far away. 
Won't you be my Valentine

won't you celebrate with me
what i have shaped into
a kind of life? i had no model.
born in babylon
both nonwhite and woman
what did i see to be except myself?
i made it up
here on this bridge between
starshine and clay,
my one hand holding tight
my one hand; come celebrate
with me that everyday
something has tried to kill me
and has failed. 


Wonder and mind marched for northern lights 
They met wise knights and silent nights
To question about the essence of life
The stars through their dazzling delights 
Gave them some  signs and sights 
But the wise knights spell the mystique
Faith by birth, destiny by the stars
Just be just and in heaven
that's all that counts


I’m not here to quote thy face akin to a rose
Nothing but nothing grows to match your beauty pose, 

Your sparkling eyes make diamond dull as a dismal day, 
No diamond can ‘wink’ come hither to play

An’ melt Samson into his own shoes, 
Cutting his hair for weakened blues.

Your curvy shape creates metaphors in man’s head, 
They all see themselves waiting in the wedding bed, 

Your inner thighs set the bar for silky softness, 
Which the silkworm’s production fails a miserably mess.

Woman softly softly with that magic beguile
Beaming out that feminine smile, 

Since home was a cave, man does not want to be alone
Softly softly he wants woman in his home


Some future day, 
when from Heaven we look
down upon New York, 
we may see a mausoleum. 
a great wonder of the world! 
All America's architects, 
surveyors and designers
will join as one until the
work is done - on the
greatet wonder of the world.

It must be glorious, like none other
with names in gold of all who died, 
and intertwined between the pillars
shrubs and flowers ~ maintained
with pride.  Travellers all around the 
globe, will come from far to bow
their heads.  Is this a dream
that could come true?  
America will see it through. 

I wonder, ponder
what awaits yonder
as I wander


Wonderer

Not from this present age
But from start of the literature page
You will find prominence 
For the beautiful ladies 

And if she is poetess or model
She is liked to excel
As readers shall go after
Her stuff and offer good comments

Some may try to go near
Impress upon and send cheers
Even for rotten material 
But we are all individuals 

The likes and dislikes differ
It can never be similar
Somewhere we tend to be soft
As mind makes u turn or shifts

Yu may not get quick attention
As human relation is such
You try to have friends of dissimilar gender 
So you are basically wonderer


When calm prevails
Peaceful effort fails
Lot many thoughts invade silently 
Whole chain of thoughts end abruptly 

Day passes without problem
As it is full of struggle then 
Noon makes you sweat more
There is lot more to explore

Evening has to be pleasant
As it has toiled you hard for the wants
But the nights become scary
It is flooded with all kinds of worry 

Why it happened? 
What was needed? 
Somehow or rather it crops in mind
We are awakened whole night to find

It is idle mind
That is very kind
Poor chamber is pressed into service
To keep up next day’s promise

It is neither love affair
Nor for any new fair
It is simple matter
But that makes you to wonder

So calm and so peaceful
Yet they are dreadful
Any attempts at peace becomes unsuccessful
As night is really day’s wonderful companion


Every mornings 
and evenings 
are your turn 
Today I broke 
the silence
of your own.
Yesterday's 
dates back many
under captured
silence and solitude.  
I saw a star 
And space 
between the lines 
in the skies 
and scold myself 
for depicting 
my leafless tree. 
Today it bloomed again 
with wonderful flowers.
Thanks to thee again
for its wonderful
scented petals
shining among stars.


Handsome man ponder at my masculine size.
I'm not huge or toned to appeal to the judges eyes, 
but when i begin to tell them
they think i'm telling lies.
I say, 
it's in the heat of my endurence, 
the sweat on my neck, 
the direction of my stride, 
and the strength of my pecks
i'm a man
wonderfully! 
wonderful man, 
that's who i am.


I stroll into a room
just as proud as you think, 
and to a woman, 
the ladies stand or
just stare and blink, 
they look at me
like i'm just too crazy.
I say, 
it's in the action of my words, 
the humour of my jokes, 
and those unusual habits, 
that make me a bloke, 
i'm a man
wonderfully! 
wonderful man, 
that's who i am.


Others themselves have tried to know
just what they observe in me, 
they try so hard
but they just get charred
while trying to work out my interior simplicity, 
when i try to explain to them
they think i'm silly.
I say, 
it's in the scent of my musk, 
the hair on my chin, 
my listening ears, 
the diamonds in my grin, 
i'm a man
wonderfully! 
wonderful man, 
that's who i am.

Now you truly realize
why i keep my face low, 
i don't brag and prance about
with an inflated ego, 
when i pass by
i'll let you know.
I say, 
it's in the love of my silence, 
the sincerity of my voice, 
the planned decision, 
in my style of choice, 
because i'm a man
wonderfully! 
wonderful man, 
that's who i am


It was wonderfully fat, 
squashy to the touch.
I liked the feeling very much
as I held it softly in my heart
and felt the lifeforce throb
and beat.


Omnipresent, a delight, 
a rhapsody of all that's right.

A comfort blanket, white and clean, 
I'd poke it with my finger
and luxuriate in its heat.
I'd linger, feel the glow upon my skin
and hold the heavenly joy within.

Like candyfloss and cashmere sweaters
there was a softness
sensually unfettered
that tickled and stroked
my very being



i wonder why the past
goes by so fast
and why times ahead
are times i dread
i wonder why the world around us
makes such a fuss
over all the trivial things
fancy cars, diamond rings
when the real heart of the matter is
we can live without all this
and all that we really need
is love, hope, and helping those in need
so what i'm wondering is this
can't we make this world a better place? i wish. 


I wonder if you know
How high you’ve lifted me 
How far there is to fall, 
If you should let me go.
I read your lips, divine
Your eyes, and wonder if
this will always be so. 


Wonderous isn't it the child come to life
Filling the stable with wonderful aroma I'm sure

As a mom there is nothing as precious as giving birth
wonderful aroma indeed

sparkling eyes looking at you with a glimmer
This is my mommy.

No tears to fall just a glance eye to eye I'm sure


I once witness a wonders of nature
from a distance in the midst afternoon
heat of the sun piercing my skin
winds of November blows my hair
it takes courage climbing the stairs
before you reach the peak of dome.

Suddenly I was immured
amazed and mesmerized
the panoramic view was superb and marvelous
not a hundreds but a thousand hills
situated extensively almost touch the clouds
from a place where i was standing 
perfect serenade leveled my sight
in my vision it was reachable 
kisses, ferrero rocher and tobleron but giant in sized


They said
during summer it turns brown
during rainy days it turns green
it was then
colors changing hue
call it chocolate hills
only here


The  day  was  just  like  any  day, 
Though  it  was  so  long  ago.
I  can't  recall  just  how  it  was
Before  I  loved  her  so.

I  guess  my  life  was  happy  then, 
Before  it  came  to  me.
I  just  don't  know,  I'm  not  that  sure.
I  was  a  child,  you  see.

But  it's  this  I  know  for  certain.
It  happened  at  midday.
An  arrow  shot  from  Cupid's  bow
Brought  Wondrous  Love  my  way.

Twas  then  that  I  first  noticed  her, 
A  girl  I  always  knew.
Though  she,  nor  I,  had  dreamed  of  love; 
So  lasting  and  so  true.

I  barely  could  contain  myself.
My  face  all  flush  with  glow.
How  was  I  to  hide  it  now? 
They  all  were  bound  to  know.

We'd  just  come  in  from  having  played.
All  quiet,  now  at  rest.
Although  I'm  sure  they  all  could  hear
My  heartbeat  through  my  chest.

My  Wondrous  Love  had  come  to  me
As  no  feeling  known  before.
I  tried  so  hard  to  catch  my  breath.
I  looked  at  her  once  more.

Only  when  I  stared  at  her  
As  I  can  now  recall, 
Could  I  be  satisfied  enough  
To  calm  myself  at  all.

How  great  it  was  to  be  near  her
And  in  such  love  to  bask! 
I  yearned  to  be  much  closer  still, 
And  almost  deigned  to  ask.

Yes,  all  I  did  at  school  was  dream, 
For  giving  me  a  chance  to  feel
Such  overpowering  love.

I  loved  her  always  from  that  time, 
She  seemed  to  have  them  all  in  her, 
The  charms  that  I  adore.

The  joy  I  felt  each  time  she  neared
Gave  warmth  and  made  me  smile.
I  always  yearned  to  make  it  last, 
If  only  for  awhile.

Then  one  dark  day,  she  went  away; 
My  Wondrous  Love  and  friend.
Twas  then,  that  others  might  believe  
My  love  had  reached  its  end.

But  though  it  might  have  come  and  gone, 
It  was  not  so  with  me.
For  she  became  my  one  great  love, 
I  think  you'll  now  agree.

The  moments  of  my  life  since  then, 
Became  these  lonely  years.
As  sadness  seized  my  loving  heart  
And  soaked  it  with  my  tears.

So  looking  back,  you  know  it's  true, 
As  I  knew  even  then; 
I'd  never  know  throughout  my  life, 
Such  Wondrous  Love  again. 

Wood the flower flails, 
So sad is now that vase, 
None else to ever know, 
That flower has joined the breeze, 
Never to harvest new blooms.

Flower failed the wood a well, 
A mothers dreary tail again to see, 
To mix two hearts of one must she, 
There beds now like the rest unmade. 


And now than latter, tell me honey what is this? 
Just are as you of this and this you are my only love.
Even there caught up between the Ivory pillows.
Longing how it reaches out a branch to you.
And how could it have been my teacher, forever it is long.
Never worth the wait, not waiting, having, drinking it all in. 
Having it the all and love it's just you wished it after all.  
Before each late sunrise, early dawn sunsets. 
And the backdoor left ajar and light the sprinkled skies.  
Sitting down to cup after cup I drink this tea, longing yes of wait.
And after the teacups have been wiped off, removed, 
after all the shadows from the dress and tussled dark green silk 
how much longer is this trail the lenghth this song I sing, 
along the wooden polished floor.
And turning back around towards open sky my window, is. 
Should I say it to this crying face I am looking up, below. 


I part the out thrusting branches
and come in beneath
the blessed and the blessing trees.
Though I am silent
there is singing around me.
Though I am dark
there is vision around me.
Though I am heavy
there is flight around me. 


The wind flapped loose, the wind was still,
Shaken out dead from tree and hill:
I had walk’d on at the wind’s will,—
I sat now, for the wind was still.

Between my knees my forehead was,—
My lips, drawn in, said not Alas!
My hair was over in the grass,
My naked ears heard the day pass.

My eyes, wide open, had the run
Of some ten weeds to fix upon;
Among those few, out of the sun,
The woodspurge flower’d, three cups in one.

From perfect grief there need not be
Wisdom or even memory:
One thing learnt remains to me,—
The woodspurge has a cup of three. 


Nature's own
leaving a trail of frail woman
up front, behind him.
What would the gay men see
besides that trap door at the
slope at the base the rocking foot of.
Texas spit him out
and America the you then sucked him up into.
Donning the robe he wrapped 
around your beating heart you gave him.
Solid this human being he cares for he fights them.
Live on the screen acting you out in school, 
not one minute of each
of each out of your reach innocent his face makes you glow


We have a snug retreat far in the woods
Not bigger than a robin’s nest
 But cozy and comfy for just two souls
A hide out from the fuss n’ fever of life

It has a small garden hemmed with a hedge
Neatly laid out in decor and taste
And gleaming with refreshing verdure
The haunt of butterflies and honey bees

An ideal place to sneak away now and then
From life’s pressing cares and concerns
Here the air is pristine sans soot and fumes.
A confluence where peace and beauty unite! 

Here we break loose the tethers
From the rigid civilities of urban living
Throw away the habits of reserve
And become joyous and free hearted

Sometimes we make an impromptu trip
Sometimes we plan it well in advance
Whatever it be, being here is fun
And enjoy it like a weekend picnic

On some evenings we go gathering
Succulent fruits and wild berries
And roam to the wide stretch of open fields, 
Lying furrowed waiting for seasonal crops

More than ever we now seek solitude.
It is in the quiet and not in the noise, 
That we are able to plumb life’s depths
That we listen to our hearts’ songs

It is here our souls acquire dove’s wings.
Though time has taken its toll from our bodies, 
Though youth and beauty have gone for ever, 
Still we walk in the woods with hands clasped


Winter, woolly jumpers
Are what comfort me, 
When the weathers cold and frosty, 
Woollens are for me.

So furs are an an anthem
And skins of any kind
Give me my woolly jumper
And true happiness I find. 

Words run rampant in my mind
left undefined
but to slowly define
the meanings
unravels the mystery of words


are like water

. 

in a stream

endlessly flowing

. 

into meaning

gathering 

. 

whatever 
 
dissolving elements

cascading sentences

manuscripted documents


Out of us all
That make rhymes
Will you choose
Sometimes -
As the winds use
A crack in a wall
Or a drain,
Their joy or their pain
To whistle through -
Choose me,
You English words?

I know you:
You are light as dreams,
Tough as oak,
Precious as gold,
As poppies and corn,
Or an old cloak:
Sweet as our birds
To the ear,
As the burnet rose
In the heat
Of Midsummer:
Strange as the races
Of dead and unborn:
Strange and sweet
Equally,
And familiar,
To the eye,
As the dearest faces
That a man knows,
And as lost homes are:
But though older far
Than oldest yew, -
As our hills are, old, -
Worn new
Again and again:
Young as our streams
After rain:
And as dear
As the earth which you prove
That we love.

Make me content
With some sweetness
From Wales
Whose nightingales
Have no wings, -
From Wiltshire and Kent
And Herefordshire, -
And the villages there, -
From the names, and the things
No less.
Let me sometimes dance
With you,
Or climb
Or stand perchance
In ecstasy,
Fixed and free
In a rhyme,
As poets do. 


Be careful of words, 
even the miraculous ones. 
For the miraculous we do our best, 
sometimes they swarm like insects 
and leave not a sting but a kiss. 
They can be as good as fingers. 
They can be as trusty as the rock 
you stick your bottom on. 
But they can be both daisies and bruises. 
Yet I am in love with words. 
They are doves falling out of the ceiling. 
They are six holy oranges sitting in my lap. 
They are the trees, the legs of summer, 
and the sun, its passionate face. 
Yet often they fail me. 
I have so much I want to say, 
so many stories, images, proverbs, etc. 
But the words aren't good enough, 
the wrong ones kiss me. 
Sometimes I fly like an eagle 
but with the wings of a wren. 
But I try to take care 
and be gentle to them. 
Words and eggs must be handled with care. 
Once broken they are impossible 
things to repair. 

Although they are
only breath, words
which I command
are immortal





Words point at the Truth
Just as you can point
With your finger to the moon

But just as your finger 
IS not the moon
Words ARE not the Truth

And just as we can see the moon
Without your finger
It is possible to see the Truth
Without words

It's good to be guided by the words
To find the Truth
But without silence
Without reflection
Without  connection to your soul
Any word will be in vain.

The words are there for us, 
Let us see them with our soul.


You have one kind of beauty
in the mirror 
another in bed.

Ignore their whispers
dress up
put your lipstick on.

Come
just to spite them
to the coffeehouse
at promenade time.

Let them whisper:
you're my friend,
aren't you


Words always appear small
but one may pile them up to form a home
that would suffice for the two of us
Words always look scattered
but one can glue them into a toy
that may pacify a hungry child
Words always seem meager
but one may save them for a yard of land
where one may plant a few dreams
Words, no doubt, cost a lot,
but one may turn them into instalments
to carry home a T. 

V. set
Words are, indeed, full of blessings
like the evenings at a saint's shrine
like the songs that sailors sing
liek the ragged hands of the tillers
like a mother's prayer
like the children's calls

How can they be served what do they mean? 
You say Tree and I say bush, how do we think? 
Leaves and moss.
Light beards and hills the moon, smooth mounds.
Roses I have known.
It is light as a dream, 
it is hard as Iron your will as soft as beaten gold.
As a poppy grows and corn is early it is yellow, very.

Equally what is strange about the way we speak? 
Honey it is and is sweet and is, and it is was well known, 
in the eye, I am the person having known you.
And you make the windows of the house 
which are clear when I am gone.
And when i'm gone you polish every thing most clear surface.

Come with me or with you come and it dances.
I forgive you for the fact that I was never using you. 
Come to me without you tricking me.
And free rhyme, the poet nose is in the way. 

Some of us have said it all, some again have concealed it
Not one of us has read it all, not one of us has seen every one of it
It's written in books it is drawn on walls, its bolded, hyphened, italic or even printed small
It is powerful, it is evolutionary, it is taught in school, but it's more than just the words in a stupid dictionary
It brings joy: it brings sorrow, it is given and it can be borrowed
It can have a long lasting impression whereas; it can deteriorate interests and attraction
There are so many of it but yet so little is used
Some can be subtracted: some can be fused
Some are used incorrectly while others are abused
The words you use can illustrate what kind of person you are
Only a lovely person can use lovely words
But it takes more than just words to describe a certain person in particular. 

I HAD this thought a while ago,
'My darling cannot understand
What I have done, or what would do
In this blind bitter land.'
And I grew weary of the sun
Until my thoughts cleared up again,
Remembering that the best I have done
Was done to make it plain;
That every year I have cried, 'At length
My darling understands it all,
Because I have come into my strength,
And words obey my call';
That had she done so who can say
What would have shaken from the sieve?
I might have thrown poor words away
And been content to live. 


The world does not need words. It articulates itself 
in sunlight, leaves, and shadows. The stones on the path 
are no less real for lying uncatalogued and uncounted.
The fluent leaves speak only the dialect of pure being. 
The kiss is still fully itself though no words were spoken.


And one word transforms it into something less or other--


illicit, chaste, perfunctory, conjugal, covert.
Even calling it a kiss betrays the fluster of hands 
glancing the skin or gripping a shoulder, the slow 
arching of neck or knee, the silent touching of tongues.

Yet the stones remain less real to those who cannot 
name them, or read the mute syllables graven in silica. 
To see a red stone is less than seeing it as jasper--
metamorphic quartz, cousin to the flint the Kiowa 
carved as arrowheads. To name is to know and remember.

The sunlight needs no praise piercing the rainclouds, 
painting the rocks and leaves with light, then dissolving 
each lucent droplet back into the clouds that engendered it. 
The daylight needs no praise, and so we praise it always-- 
greater than ourselves and all the airy words we summon. 


I'm not well spoken
And find myself more often than not, 
fumbling over words most can't fathom
let alone grasp meaning. 
I've lived as though these words encase more than just a being of sound mind and body, 
I have lived a thousand stories
And ventured far into the depths of people as deep as dictionaries 
and seen past the ones that were meager short stories.

I have much to read and a pen at the ready to write down every novel I have met. 


WORDS AGAINST DEATH

All the immortals are moral: 


Lunatic Nietzsche banging a piano to oblivion
Great Tolstoy escaping to a railroad coach, 
Gentle Yeats frigid at Ben Bulben. 

What lives is a work and that imperfectly: 
A thousand bankrupt eyes ferreting the hearts of dead poets
Seeking confirmation for some strange emotion, 
Doing the work in the course, being ‘intellectual’, 
Satisfying a wicked ambition for 
Knowledge or Love or Understanding.

Do these absurd gropings constitute an adequate remembrance? 
And if they do, if deep within the heart of some wise reader
There lurks a true Nietzschean spirit, 
Will Nietzsche live because of it? 
Is Remembrance no matter how deeply touched by love, 
Ever Resurrection? 


Where K broods over a Ledean body, 
Where that daring tightrope walker confuses wise old Karataev
(at Borodino or in the land of Zarathustra)  
there the great poets live: 

Could it have been, 


When with deep ambivalence he willed his writings 
to the flames


WORDS ARE ALL I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE GREATNESS OUT OF 

I have no poem
I have only my own words
They are small
I am small
Life is great-
I am not great-
Words are all I have tried to make Greatness out of 
I believe have failed. 

They rise in me
Like large waves
Overpowering me
I surrender to them
I feel so powerless

They are beautiful
Colorful
Dreams floating across sky
Like a milky way
I just want to hold them
In my hand
Oh my hand, so small to hold
They slip away
I love
To enclose them
In a bracket of words
But- 
Words are such perfect traitors



You think I'd fall with simply words
Your verbal abuse failed to penetrate
It angers me
I can't lie

It boils me like a kettle
But then the whistling tunes
And I hurt no more

I won't fall
No matter what you say
I won't crumble
No matter how you contradict

You cannot ruin my happiness
Its here to stay
Come what may

I'm still smiling
I'm still standing
And you are a mere nothing to me

Never again will I let you hurt me
Never again will I let you try
Never again will you have the opportunity
Never
I will never
For you? 
Because of you? 
No.  I will never cry



I - CRAZY JANE AND THE BISHOP

BRING me to the blasted oak
That I, midnight upon the stroke,
(All find safety in the tomb.)
May call down curses on his head
Because of my dear Jack that's dead.
Coxcomb was the least he said:
The solid man and the coxcomb.
Nor was he Bishop when his ban
Banished Jack the Journeyman,
(All find safety in the tomb.)
Nor so much as parish priest,
Yet he, an old book in his fist,
Cried that we lived like beast and beast:
The solid man and the coxcomb.
Wrinkled like the foot of a goose,
(All find safety in the tomb.)
Nor can he hide in holy black
The heron's hunch upon his back,
But a birch-tree stood my Jack:
The solid man and the coxcomb.
Jack had my virginity,
And bids me to the oak, for he
(all find safety in the tomb.)
Wanders out into the night
And there is shelter under it,
But should that other come, I spit:
The solid man and the coxcomb.

II - CRAZY JANE REPROVED

I CARE not what the sailors say:
All those dreadful thunder-stones,
All that storm that blots the day
Can but show that Heaven yawns;
Great Europa played the fool
That changed a lover for a bull.
Fol de rol, fol de rol.
To round that shell's elaborate whorl,
Adorning every secret track
With the delicate mother-of-pearl,
Made the joints of Heaven crack:
So never hang your heart upon
A roaring, ranting journeyman.
Fol de rol, fol de rol.

III - CRAZY JANE ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT

'LOVE is all
Unsatisfied
That cannot take the whole
Body and soul';
And that is what Jane said.
'Take the sour
If you take me
I can scoff and lour
And scold for an hour.'
'That's certainly the case,' said he.
'Naked I lay,
The grass my bed;
Naked and hidden away,
That black day';
And that is what Jane said.
'What can be shown?
What true love be?
All could be known or shown
If Time were but gone.'
'That's certainly the case,' said he.

IV - CRAZY JANE AND JACK THE JOURNEYMAN

I KNOW, although when looks meet
I tremble to the bone,
The more I leave the door unlatched
The sooner love is gone,
For love is but a skein unwound
Between the dark and dawn.
A lonely ghost the ghost is
I -- love's skein upon the ground,
My body in the tomb --
Shall leap into the light lost
In my mother's womb.
But were I left to lie alone
In an empty bed,
The skein so bound us ghost to ghost
When he turned his head
passing on the road that night,
Mine must walk when dead.


THAT lover of a night
Came when he would,
Went in the dawning light
Whether I would or no;
Men come, men go;
Banners choke the sky;
Men-at-arms tread;
Armoured horses neigh
In the narrow pass:
Before their eyes a house
That from childhood stood
Uninhabited, ruinous,
Suddenly lit up
From door to top:
I had wild Jack for a lover;
Though like a road
That men pass over
My body makes no moan
But sings on:

VI - CRAZY JANE TALKS WITH THE BISHOP

I MET the Bishop on the road
And much said he and I.
'Those breasts are flat and fallen now,
Those veins must soon be dry;
Live in a heavenly mansion,
Not in some foul sty.'
'Fair and foul are near of kin,
And fair needs foul,' I cried.
'My friends are gone, but that's a truth
Nor grave nor bed denied,
Learned in bodily lowliness
And in the heart's pride.
'A woman can be proud and stiff
When on love intent;
But Love has pitched his mansion in
The place of excrement;
For nothing can be sole or whole
That has not been rent.'


VII - CRAZY JANE GROWN OLD LOOKS AT THE DANCERS

I FOUND that ivory image there
Dancing with her chosen youth,
But when he wound her coal-black hair
As though to strangle her, no scream
Or bodily movement did I dare,
Eyes under eyelids did so gleam;
Love is like the lion's tooth.
When She, and though some said she played
I said that she had danced heart's truth,
Drew a knife to strike him dead,
I could but leave him to his fate;
For no matter what is said
They had all that had their hate;
Love is like the lion's tooth.
Did he die or did she die?
Seemed to die or died they both?
Cared not a thraneen for what chanced
So that I had the limbs to try
Such a dance as there was danced --
Love is like the lion's tooth.


VIII - GIRL'S SONG

I WENT out alone
To sing a song or two,
My fancy on a man,
And you know who.
Another came in sight
That on a stick relied
To hold himself upright;
I sat and cried.
And that was all my song --
When everything is told,
Saw I an old man young
Or young man old?


IX - YOUNG MAN'S SONG

'SHE will change,' I cried.
'Into a withered crone.'
The heart in my side,
That so still had lain,
In noble rage replied
And beat upon the bone:
'Uplift those eyes and throw
Those glances unafraid:
She would as bravely show
Did all the fabric fade;
No withered crone I saw
Before the world was made.'
Abashed by that report,
For the heart cannot lie,
I knelt in the dirt.
And all shall bend the knee
To my offended heart
Until it pardon me.


X - HER ANXIETY

EARTH in beauty dressed
Awaits returning spring.
All true love must die,
Alter at the best
Into some lesser thing.
Prove that I lie.
Such body lovers have,
Such exacting breath,
That they touch or sigh.
Every touch they give,
Love is nearer death.
Prove that I lie.


XI - HIS CONFIDENCE

UNDYING love to buy
I wrote upon
The corners of this eye
All wrongs done.
What payment were enough
For undying love?
I broke my heart in two
So hard I struck.
What matter? for I know
That out of rock,
Out of a desolate source,
Love leaps upon its course.


XII - LOVE'S LONELINESS

OLD fathers, great-grandfathers,
Rise as kindred should.
If ever lover's loneliness
Came where you stood,
Pray that Heaven protect us
That protect your blood.
The mountain throws a shadow,
Thin is the moon's horn;
What did we remember
Under the ragged thorn?
Dread has followed longing,
And our hearts are torn.


XIII - HER DREAM

I DREAMED as in my bed I lay,
All night's fathomless wisdom come,
That I had shorn my locks away
And laid them on Love's lettered tomb:
But something bore them out of sight
In a great tumult of the air,
And after nailed upon the night
Berenice's burning hair.


XIV - HIS BARGAIN

WHO talks of Plato's spindle;
What set it whirling round?
Eternity may dwindle,
Time is unwound,
Dan and Jerry Lout
Change their loves about.
However they may take it,
Before the thread began
I made, and may not break it
When the last thread has run,
A bargain with that hair
And all the windings there.


XV - THREE THINGS

'O CRUEL Death, give three things back,'
Sang a bone upon the shore;
'A child found all a child can lack,
Whether of pleasure or of rest,
Upon the abundance of my breast':
A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.
'Three dear things that women know,'
Sang a bhone upon the shore;
'A man if I but held him so
When my body was alive
Found all the pleasure that life gave':
A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.
'The third thing that I think of yet,'
Sang a bone upon the shore,
'Is that morning when I met
Face to face my rightful man
And did after stretch and yawn':
A bone wave-whitened and dried in the wind.

XVI - LULLABY

BELOVED, may your sleep be sound
That have found it where you fed.
What were all the world's alarms
To mighty paris when he found
Sleep upon a golden bed
That first dawn in Helen's arms?
Sleep, beloved, such a sleep
As did that wild Tristram know
When, the potion's work being done,
Roe could run or doe could leap
Under oak and beechen bough,
Roe could leap or doe could run;
Such a sleep and sound as fell
Upon Eurotas' grassy bank
When the holy bird, that there
Accomplished his predestined will,
From the limbs of Leda sank
But not from her protecting care.

XVII - AFTER LONG SILENCE

SPEECH after long silence; it is right,
All other lovers being estranged or dead,
Unfriendly lamplight hid under its shade,
The curtains drawn upon unfriendly night,
That we descant and yet again descant
Upon the supreme theme of Art and Song:
Bodily decrepitude is wisdom; young
We loved each other and were ignorant.


XVIII - MAD AS THE MIST AND SNOW

BOLT and bar the shutter,
For the foul winds blow:
Our minds are at their best this night,
And I seem to know
That everything outside us is
Mad as the mist and snow.
Horace there by Homer stands,
Plato stands below,
And here is Tully's open page.
How many years ago
Were you and I unlettered lads
Mad as the mist and snow?
You ask what makes me sigh, old friend,
What makes me shudder so?
I shudder and I sigh to think
That even Cicero
And many-minded Homer were
Mad as the mist and snow.

XIX - THOSE DANCING DAYS ARE GONE

COME, let me sing into your ear;
Those dancing days are gone,
All that silk and satin gear;
Crouch upon a stone,
Wrapping that foul body up
In as foul a rag:
I carry the sun in a golden cup.
The moon in a silver bag.
Curse as you may I sing it through;
What matter if the knave
That the most could pleasure you,
The children that he gave,
Are somewhere sleeping like a top
Under a marble flag?
I carry the sun in a golden cup.
The moon in a silver bag.
I thought it out this very day.
Noon upon the clock,
A man may put pretence away
Who leans upon a stick,
May sing, and sing until he drop,
Whether to maid or hag:
I carry the sun in a golden cup,
The moon in a silver bag.


XX - 'I AM OF IRELAND'

And the Holy Land of Ireland,
And time runs on,' cried she.
'Come out of charity,
Come dance with me in Ireland.'
One man, one man alone
In that outlandish gear,
One solitary man
Of all that rambled there
Had turned his stately head.
That is a long way off,
And time runs on,' he said,
'And the night grows rough.'
I am of Ireland,
And the Holy Land of Ireland,
And time runs on,' cried she.
'Come out of charity
And dance with me in Ireland.'
The fiddlers are all thumbs,
Or the fiddle-string accursed,
The drums and the kettledrums
And the trumpets all are burst,
And the trombone,' cried he,
'The trumpet and trombone,'
And cocked a malicious eye,
'But time runs on, runs on.'
I am of Ireland,
And the Holy Land of Ireland,
And time runs on,' cried she.
'Come out of charity
And dance with me in Ireland.'


XXI - THE DANCER AT CRUACHAN AND CRO-PATRICK

I, PROCLAIMING that there is
Among birds or beasts or men
One that is perfect or at peace.
Danced on Cruachan's windy plain,
Upon Cro-patrick sang aloud;
All that could run or leap or swim
Whether in wood, water or cloud,
Acclaiming, proclaiming, declaiming Him.

XXII - TOM THE LUNATIC

SANG old Tom the lunatic
That sleeps under the canopy:
'What change has put my thoughts astray
And eyes that had s-o keen a sight?
What has turned to smoking wick
Nature's pure unchanging light?
'Huddon and Duddon and Daniel O'Leary.
Holy Joe, the beggar-man,
Wenching, drinking, still remain
Or sing a penance on the road;
Something made these eyeballs weary
That blinked and saw them in a shroud.
'Whatever stands in field or flood,
Bird, beast, fish or man,
Mare or stallion, cock or hen,
In all the vigour of its blood;
In that faith I live or die.'

XXIII - TOM AT CRUACHAN

ON Cruachan's plain slept he
That must sing in a rhyme
What most could shake his soul:
'The stallion Eternit
Mounted the mare of Time,
'Gat the foal of the world.'


XXIV - OLD TOM AGAIN

THINGS out of perfection sail,
And all their swelling canvas wear,
Nor shall the self-begotten fail
Though fantastic men suppose
Building-yard and stormy shore,
Winding-sheet and swaddling -- clothes.


XXV - THE DELPHIC ORACLE UPON PLOTINUS

BEHOLD that great Plotinus swim,
Buffeted by such seas;
Bland Rhadamanthus beckons him,
But the Golden Race looks dim,
Salt blood blocks his eyes.
Scattered on the level grass
Or winding through the grove
plato there and Minos pass,
There stately Pythagoras
And all the choir of Love. 

I called to the wind of the Winter,
As he sped like a steed on his way,
'Oh! rest for awhile on thy journey,
And answer these questions, I pray.


'Who is the foe to all virtue,
Who is the chieftain of crime?
Who blackens the forehead of beauty,
And cheateth the finger of time?
Who maketh the heart to be aged,
In the beautiful morning of youth?
Who is the herald of sorrow,
And who the assassin of Truth?
Who is the help-meet of Satan,
The agent of regions below?
Who the promoter of vices?
Who loadeth the bosom with woe?
Who stealeth the strength of the mighty?
Who stealeth the wits of the wise?
Who maketh the good and the noble
A thing that the meanest despise?'


And the wind of the wild Winter answered,
In a voice like a clarion call:
''Tis a beast legion-headed, a demon
Whom men christened 'King Alcohol.'
This is the help-meet that Satan
Sends out from the kingdom of hell,
A many-faced demon, who doeth
The work of the master right well;
For he weaveth his web round the noble,
And slayeth the soul with his breath.
Ah! this is the foe to all virtue,
And this is the agent of death.


'weighted words, tossed like beach balls
from heart to broken heart
the true meaning is lost, but
we still speak its message

weighted words, eaten like french fries
too much speaking, not enough thinking
fading away from overuse
the true meaning is lost


So many things were left unspoken
Her heart is now broken
Her life is so much like a scary dream
She wakes up with a scream
Will this pain last forever? 
She wanted him not another
He just up and walk away
Leaving her there stund with nothing to say
As she stands there with her broke heart
He ripped it out and tore is apart
She tryes so hard not to cry
Why did she believe his lie? 
She thought he was her lover
Now  she crys and holds tight to her cover
She looks into the mirrer and asks why didn't he love me? 
I guess I am not as good as she
I wish we didn't have to say goodbye
Wish he would at least try


Helen of Troy had a wandering glance; 
Sappho's restriction was only the sky; 
Ninon was ever the chatter of France; 
But oh, what a good girl am I


I dreamt I flew as ibis fly
o'er sand and palm and sunny Nile
when all at once, there caught my eye
a host of grinning crocodilei was about to give up, 
writing eva, 
but some people said no, 
that i was too good to give up, 
i thought they were crazy, 
there minds had gone hazy, 
but then they gave me, 
words of encouragement, 
that made me think, 
maybe i'm not so bad, 
maybe i should keep writing, 
but then i read my work again, 
and realised where i'd gone wrong, 
i wasn't focusing on the positives, 
and the good things, 
all i could see were the errors, 
and the problems that couldn't be fixed, 
and i realised that, 
underneath the negatives, 
my writing wasn't so bad, 
and so that helped me to keep writnig, 
so i have to thank, 
all those people who, 
didn't give up on me, 
and gave me those, 
words of encouragement, 
thank you. 


Words of honey from the ashes
Broke out from the silence of anthills
And filled my eyes as well as my heart
As I swim in the pool of sorrows.
 
Dreams drained in the womb
Where no body to care
Offering my eternal life
Like the dusk depicted in ignis.

The unknown symbol of my journey
Marked as domestic fire, defensive fire
Wiped out clearly like the waves of ocean. 

Fear not the words of the right
The code from the divine might
Compose the rules for  life
And not just how we survive 
They shine many lives to come, 
And forever shall be and to last 
Whether for other stars or for us


Wordsworth, thy music like a river rolls 
Among the mountains, and thy song is fed 
By living springs far up the watershed; 
No whirling flood nor parching drought controls 
The crystal current: even on the shoals
It murmurs clear and sweet; and when its bed
Darkens below mysterious cliffs of dread, 
Thy voice of peace grows deeper in our souls. 

But thou in youth hast known the breaking stress
Of passion, and hast trod despair's dry ground
Beneath black thoughts that wither and destroy.
Ah, wanderer, led by human tenderness
Home to the heart of Nature, thou hast found
The hidden Fountain of Recovered Joy. 

Let me but do my work from day to day,
In field or forest, at the desk or loom,
In roaring market-place or tranquil room;
Let me but find it in my heart to say,
When vagrant wishes beckon me astray,
"This is my work; my blessing, not my doom;
"Of all who live, I am the one by whom
"This work can best be done in the right way


Then shall I see it not too great, nor small,
To suit my spirit and to prove my powers;
Then shall I cheerful greet the labouring hours,
And cheerful turn, when the long shadows fall
At eventide, to play and love and rest,
Because I know for me my work is best. 

Work is the curse of the working class
The rich just bide their time
Work gives riches to all but me
The rich just get by fine

Work is the cures of the working class
The ratio is not clear
The rich get most of all that’s earnt
The worker just little I fear

The worker is not a happy soul
The rich sit back in glee
And if he gets but half a chance
they’ll take everything from me

If I get rich I would like to think 
That wealth I would want to share
But something tells me when you’re rich
You never seem to care

So all I ask is half a chance 
To prove that theory wrong
Give me half a million quid
And see how I get along 

No’ give me two’ no give me three
Sod it give me four
Just look what happens when you’re rich
You’re always wanting more

So maybe work will keep me down
My feet firm on the floor
I have my wife my health my kids
Who could ask for more. 


Work is never easy 
to do or accomplish

Yet many wish for it
As something very light
That don't need burden
In doing a work or two

Yet many wish for it
As a means to gain
That worth a fortune
In doing so little work

Yet many do not realize
That work need not be hard
For as long as you love work
Then it becomes easy to do

For work if done willingly
And with interest that persist
Then it will be the only solution
To obtain a meaningful and fruitful life


The woman singeth at her spinning-wheel
A pleasant chant, ballad or barcarole;
She thinketh of her song, upon the whole,
Far more than of her flax; and yet the reel
Is full, and artfully her fingers feel
With quick adjustment, provident control,
The lines--too subtly twisted to unroll--
Out to a perfect thread. I hence appeal
Our Father's business in these temples mirk,
Thus swift and steadfast, thus intent and strong;
While thus, apart from toil, our souls pursue
Some high calm spheric tune, and prove our work
The better for the sweetness of our song. 

Then a ploughman said, "Speak to us of Work
 


And he answered, saying: 

You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth. 

For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life's procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite. 

When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music. 

Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison? 

Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune. 

But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth's furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born, 

And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, 

And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life's inmost secret. 

But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written. 

You have been told also life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary. 

And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge, 

And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge, 

And all knowledge is vain save when there is work, 

And all work is empty save when there is love; 


And what is it to work with love? 

It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. 

It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house. 

It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit. 

It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit, 

And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching. 

Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, "he who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is a nobler than he who ploughs the soil. 

And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet
 


But I say, not in sleep but in the over-wakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass; 

And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving. 

Work is love made visible. 

And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy. 

For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger. 

And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distills a poison in the wine. 

And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night. 

Box cars run by a mile long.
And I wonder what they say to each other
When they stop a mile long on a sidetrack.
Maybe their chatter goes:
I came from Fargo with a load of wheat up to the danger line.
I came from Omaha with a load of shorthorns and they splintered my boards.
I came from Detroit heavy with a load of fivers.
I carried apples from the Hood river last year and this year bunches of bananas from Florida; they look for me with watermelons from Mississippi next year.

Hammers and shovels of work gangs sleep in shop corners
when the dark stars come on the sky and the night watchmen walk and look.

Then the hammer heads talk to the handles,
then the scoops of the shovels talk,
how the day’s work nicked and trimmed them,
how they swung and lifted all day,
how the hands of the work gangs smelled of hope.
In the night of the dark stars
when the curve of the sky is a work gang handle,
in the night on the mile long sidetracks,
in the night where the hammers and shovels sleep in corners,
the night watchmen stuff their pipes with dreams—
and sometimes they doze and don’t care for nothin’,
and sometimes they search their heads for meanings, stories, stars.
The stuff of it runs like this:
A long way we come; a long way to go; long rests and long deep sniffs for our lungs on the way.
Sleep is a belonging of all; even if all songs are old songs and the singing heart is snuffed out like a switchman’s lantern with the oil gone, even if we forget our names and houses in the finish, the secret of sleep is left us, sleep belongs to all, sleep is the first and last and best of all.

People singing; people with song mouths connecting with song hearts; people who must sing or die; people whose song hearts break if there is no song mouth; these are my people. 


THERE are whispers
sometimes i think there are ghosts
of my past
am i getting to be a scrooge
in this line of work
that i am submerged in like
a submarine
on a broken machine


It is time to go
The work is eating us all
giving us no meaning. 


Work, sleep, work, sleep,  
Work, sleep, work, sleep,  
Work, sleep, work, sleep,  
Work: 

Work, sleep, work, sleep,  
Work, sleep, work, sleep,  
Work, sleep, work, sleep,  
Work.


Oh free me please with gentle ease
From work, sleep, work, sleep, work! 
This odium, pounding tedium 
Of my work, sleep, work, sleep, work.

Just whisk me off to lands afar 
From work, sleep, work, sleep, work -
That grinding train of rhythmic pain
Called ‘Work, sleep, work, sleep, work.’

Poor neural circuits fizzle and pop 
In work, sleep, work, sleep, work, 
In trying to make some sense of all this
Work, sleep, work, sleep, work.

But Hark! I see a golden gleam - 
A saving spirit of hope: 
‘You’re fired! ’ He screams. What news to bear, 
This wondrous hangman’s rope! 

So now I’m free, released from all this
Work, sleep, work, sleep, work - 
Eternal peace and rest for me, no
Work, sleep, work, sleep, work. 

Well I've been spendin' my life lookin' for a shoulder
To rest my head when the nights get colder
But the days are gettin' longer and I'm gettin' older
Been long time workin' it out

I been a long time workin' it out I been a long time workin' it out
I been a long time workin' it out I been a long time workin' it out

Now I got a little woman to scrub my floor
Right down the road I got me two or three more
And you know none of them knows about the one next door
I been a long time workin' it out
I been a long time workin' it out. 

Well it was late one night when I stole a little money
I bought a couple of things and then gave them to my honey
And the judge said boy if you this that's funny
You got a long time workin' it out
I got a long time workin' it out. 
[ guitar ]
Yeah well I look all around me and what do I see
The whole wide world got trouble like me
Between the taxes the missus and the deep blue sea
You'll be a long time workin' it out
We'll be a long time workin' it out.  


FOREVER CAN'T GET HERE SOON ENOUGH.
SO IN THE MEANTIME, 
I'LL JUST SETTLE WITH DESTINY

Waking before the sun starts its day
So I can catch a train cant be a delay
Breakfast is a on the run 
Maybe I’ll be losing weight, what fun

First in the door, turn on lights and computer
Now the kettle, a cuppa comes after.
Check all the emails that have come in over night
Nearly forgot to turn off divert, that’s right


Phone starts to ring
Cant hear the birds sing
Time flashes by
No time to cry

Day almost done
Now comes the fun
Got to go catch the train
Damm I think its started to rain.

Home again in the dark
This is no lark
Is this the only way
To get more time to play


I'll protect your hive if you let us be
Babe we are green; you need my company	
I'll make you my wife if you let us be
You sound so much alone when we spoke on the phone
I need you close to me; can I be your drone? 
There's no need for money when there's good honey
Fresh from the flowers; made it just for you
Ain't got super powers but what I got is true
I got love and it's buzzing in the air
You'll get what you deserve from your toes up to your hair
Babes my love can only sting you once 
But my feeling lasts forever; the feeling of romance
I'll swarm you with my body
Around my arms you'll never feel lonely
The way you turn and twist and fly around me with your beauty
Put a working bee in duty

 Your working bee


The working girls in the morning are going to work--
     long lines of them afoot amid the downtown stores
     and factories, thousands with little brick-shaped
     lunches wrapped in newspapers under their arms.
Each morning as I move through this river of young-
     woman life I feel a wonder about where it is all
     going, so many with a peach bloom of young years
     on them and laughter of red lips and memories in
     their eyes of dances the night before and plays and
     walks.
Green and gray streams run side by side in a river and
     so here are always the others, those who have been
     over the way, the women who know each one the
     end of life's gamble for her, the meaning and the
     clew, the how and the why of the dances and the
     arms that passed around their waists and the fingers
     that played in their hair.
Faces go by written over: "I know it all, I know where
the bloom and the laughter go and I have memories,"
     and the feet of these move slower and they
     have wisdom where the others have beauty.
So the green and the gray move in the early morning
     on the downtown streets. 


lately i have been working on certain 
symbolism of his poetry
and some paintings: an old man without a foot, 
a nude woman inside his open stomach, 
stuff pegions fishing for a parachute
or an air balloon and a fish in air
a red jacket without a body
a man with the head of a big chinese fan
a secret exit where a hand feeds
a hidden snake. 


Max Ernst your painting pains me.
I am lost but soon in your symbols
i shall find the entrance 
of understanding the world within the four corners
of your brightly colored canvass. 

Van Gogh cut off his ear
gave it to a
prostitute
who flung it away in
extreme
disgust. 


O that warm February morning! 
The untimely south came 
to stir up our absurd paupers' memories, 
our young distress. 

Henrika had on a brown 
and white checked cotton skirt 
which must have been worn in the last century, 
a bonnet with ribbons and a silk scarf. 

It was much sadder than any mourning. 
We were taking a stroll in the suburbs. 
The weather was overcast 
and that wind from the south 
excited all the evil odors of the desolate
garden and the dried fields. 

It did not seem to weary my wife as it did me. 
In a puddle left by the rains of the preceding month, 
on a fairly high path, 
she called my attention to some very little fishes. 

The city with its smoke and its factory noises 
followed us far out along the roads.
O other world, habituation 
blessed by sky and shade! 

The south brought black miserable memories 
of my childhood, my summer despairs, 
the horrible quantity of strength 
and of knowledge that fate has always kept from me. 

No! we will not spend the summer 
in this avaricious country 
where we shall never be anything 
but affianced orphans. 
I want this hardened arm 
to stop dragging _a cherished image._My woman insisted
I start jogging; decided
to begin with
memories. 


I might as well begin by saying how much I like the title. 
It gets me right away because I'm in a workshop now 
so immediately the poem has my attention, 
like the Ancient Mariner grabbing me by the sleeve. 

And I like the first couple of stanzas, 
the way they establish this mode of self-pointing 
that runs through the whole poem 
and tells us that words are food thrown down 
on the ground for other words to eat. 
I can almost taste the tail of the snake 
in its own mouth, 
if you know what I mean. 

But what I'm not sure about is the voice, 
which sounds in places very casual, very blue jeans, 
but other times seems standoffish, 
professorial in the worst sense of the word 
like the poem is blowing pipe smoke in my face. 
But maybe that's just what it wants to do. 

What I did find engaging were the middle stanzas, 
especially the fourth one. 
I like the image of clouds flying like lozenges 
which gives me a very clear picture. 
And I really like how this drawbridge operator 
just appears out of the blue 
with his feet up on the iron railing 
and his fishing pole jigging—I like jigging— 
a hook in the slow industrial canal below. 
I love slow industrial canal below. All those l's. 

Maybe it's just me, 
but the next stanza is where I start to have a problem. 
I mean how can the evening bump into the stars? 
And what's an obbligato of snow? 
Also, I roam the decaffeinated streets. 
At that point I'm lost. I need help. 

The other thing that throws me off, 
and maybe this is just me, 
is the way the scene keeps shifting around. 
First, we're in this big aerodrome 
and the speaker is inspecting a row of dirigibles, 
which makes me think this could be a dream. 
Then he takes us into his garden, 
the part with the dahlias and the coiling hose, 
though that's nice, the coiling hose, 
but then I'm not sure where we're supposed to be. 
The rain and the mint green light, 
that makes it feel outdoors, but what about this wallpaper? 
Or is it a kind of indoor cemetery? 
There's something about death going on here. 

In fact, I start to wonder if what we have here 
is really two poems, or three, or four, 
or possibly none. 

But then there's that last stanza, my favorite. 
This is where the poem wins me back, 
especially the lines spoken in the voice of the mouse. 
I mean we've all seen these images in cartoons before, 
but I still love the details he uses 
when he's describing where he lives. 
The perfect little arch of an entrance in the baseboard, 
the bed made out of a curled-back sardine can, 
the spool of thread for a table. 
I start thinking about how hard the mouse had to work 
night after night collecting all these things 
while the people in the house were fast asleep, 
and that gives me a very strong feeling, 
a very powerful sense of something. 
But I don't know if anyone else was feeling that. 
Maybe that was just me. 
Maybe that's just the way I read it. 


Sun and moon  are only  motivation symbol.
Thought and its application in life
Make you  fly in the sky.

World is tiny or huge is immaterial.
World remain same  as before.
World never care for you


A clear Vision in life and
Firmness on your principle.
Only  good thought   and its application

Will full fill dream life.
World will be at your doorstep.


I watched something on the television in a program about Euthanasia 
And since my father died from cancer what palliative care would be a saviour
I can understand I think how sick people would want a choice in their death
And some dignity with it from degenerative diseases that are horrible in their breath
Countries are legislating this choice for their people in their death decision's depth
The Netherlands  made it legal with the help of a doctor to have an assisted death

Then the program showed Antoinette a Dutch older citizen
Whose ailment was a psychological illness in her lament in her end
With her doctor she presented an argument about ending it all
Because her depression was so bad she wanted it to count as her fall 
On the day of her death she had her friends, son and daughter there
For a death ceremony in her bedroom after saying goodbye for all to care

If these end of life options were to be legislated for each one of us 
With a lowering of the bar would other reasons for suicide be without a fuss
When these reasons are factored in would we shrug and say it's want they want
And assisted deaths become the norm in examining their reasons in their font
Old age, infirmity, disability or person's finite choice would be the reason
With a doctor's note agreeing to the reasons pinned to the latest victim in the end

But I find these psychological reasons to be without a lot of sense for assisted suicide
Smacking of the Nazis and getting rid of people that society would not abide
Finally would it be that the person to die may not have a choice for themselves? 


The train kept moving, 

And the outside world kept peeping.  

Oh dear friend wait a bit onto the dusk
Life has never forsaken your dream
sun stoops over heads bristling warmth
earth is least hurried high by your desire
 
passage plexus waits as long as you wish 
time never debars you to sprinkle your beams
fact is the reality as truth embraces the hope
passion is never be enticed upon by clouds
 
rain descends by crooning of clouds dark
heart yet betides by the slake of the tunes
as beauty of love makes me apart by the blow
did I not follow you until moon comes? 
 
i do remember amber glow by novels of night
as speckles of whisper wakes me up again
I look through window asking for the love
where is world lost into crowd of unknowns


I live on my own cloud, 
Where the sound of hatred is muffled.
I am nowhere bound, 
And my intentions are almost never shuffled.

Here, I live in peace, 
And no man does not respect me.
I am a masterpiece, 
And yes, I am free.

Free to speak up my mind, 
And free to simply be.
In no cage am I confined, 
And clearly I can see.

Beyond me lies a world I am eager to discover, 
Eager to learn all of life's mysteries.
Hoping on my way I recover
From the pain that resides in my stories.

Tell me not come back down, 
And let me live the way I desire.
For here, I wear the crown
Of my own empire.




the beauty of silence is like the deep ocean
we dive
and then we see a lot of things in there


the colorful corals
the hills and mound underneath the valleys
beauty that we cannot comprehend
we cannot say

it is the world of wordlessness
where everything is set free


On a sunday
i create a new world

my earth is the hammock
it is the breeze of the sea
that breathes in me
my lungs are the orchards
its branches my veins

slowly and gently
i sleep with the hands
of time. 


When I cast a look around the world,
 I marvel at what I see and hear.
 Why, I ponder , is the world at war?
 Why, I lament, should the world know no peace?
 You world Powers! Put your ammunition in its arsenal.
 Enough of nuclear wars, enough of threats of war.
 The Lilliputian Third World walking under your Gangatuan feet,
 Your duty, it is to help it outgrow its groping stage.
 There should be no re-occurrence of the war in Vietnam,
 No more fracas in Surinam,
 No repeat performance of the Soweto imbroglio.
 Rwanda should not be put asunder.
 Enough of the Somalia saga.
 Ethiopia and Liberia experience we want no more.
 Let peace reign in Bosnia Herzegovina.
 'No' to war I say, 'Yes' to peace I maintain.
 War does no good to anyone.
 War kills, war maims, war annihilates.
 Turmoil and tribulation all characterize war.
 Famine and deprivation are all babies of war.
 Wars tear families apart, refugees abound everywhere.
 Many are rendered homeless, a lot become hopeless.
 Causalities of war in the scenes of ravage and wreck,
 Letter the ground in their hundreds and thousands.
 Let's have a new world order.
 Let's make peace our watchword.
 Let peace reign supreme in the world.
 Peace brings joy; peace puts the mind at rest.
 The world must embrace peace, not war.
 The world must live, in peace, not in pieces.
 'No' to war I say, 'Yes' to peace I maintain. 


World peace
can be ours 
if it starts
at home


When the time is right and everyone’s the same

Our world will be perfect with no one left to blame

Rage and hate will be a torn up page

Love and peace will rise above

Death will be for the old who lived to love and be sent above


People will be united all across the globe

Everyone will as one loving, sharing, and peacefully caring

And when no bombs fly through the sky and other work is done

Come and see the peace but don’t ask why 

Each and every one of us together forever as one


World peace meet 

Hyderabad is large princely state in Southern India 
Very much famous and equal to other states like Scindias*
Very much prosperous and trade centre
It entered finally in Indian union 

When India won independence
Hyderabad, with Nizam* as head, tried for separate statehood
It tried for having sea outlet
But that was not allowed to let

Being land locked and mostly populated by one community
It tried to maintain separate entity
This was running to the counter to the policy of Government
It was brought under control and became part of the state 

Well, it is honor to be in that part
It has rich heritage and real cultural centre 
Whole of the country look towards south
For taking the benefit of art and culture

Since we are real dreamer 
It shall work as sun's beamer
India had been pioneer in the field of world peace 
Our dream shall not in simple chase 

The world may take note
And know how desperately we have fought
With efforts to raise awareness
And bring smile on world's face



Peace is what the world needs fast
Peace is required most
Peace can't come by waging wars 
Peace is born through great efforts! 

Peace can dwell when love prevails
Peace is the driving force
Peace must last forever to
Keep the world love life firstly

Peace is the priceless wealth much sought
Peace must start from homes
Peace must spread through all nations
And fill hearts and minds of men

Peace is one that brings progress
Peace can bridge differences
Peace is made by dialogues
Peace is the key to world's happiness
The people of bludgeoned nations
that cannot unite with one another.
The people look like they know 
that they are completely forgotten.
The imperialists from the past
still get to keep their loot that 
has now long been 'theirs'.
The Africans are fighting each other
when they should fight to get 
their property that is owed to them.
Their lives would be more enriched
if they had a sense of self.
Their own people have given into
imperialism and force this view upon
their own people without regret.
They got guns and they got drugs.
They got food and they got 'power'.
There is civil war and there is slavery.
The real imperialists sit at home and read
their papers and condone an irresponsible 
war like Iraq because we don't speak 
against it as much as we should.
We should be fighting for Africa.
We should be fighting for humanity.


A hundred years ago, Koch found
The bacillus causing TB, 
That gave the world's scientists the ground
To find the drugs as remedy.

Then, TB was a pandemic, 
And was called ‘Consumption' that killed
The high and low, as all turned sick
And sanatoria all filled.

Most people feared the ‘phthisis' much; 
And treatment was by good food, air; 
And nurses gave the magic touch
Of kindness, tender loving care.

The bacilli by droplets spread
To lungs, and every body part; 
The person melted, ridden-bed -
A downhill course right from the start! 

Then came the anti-TB drugs
That inhibited growth of rod; 
A prolonged course thus healed the lungs: 
A two year treatment looking odd! 

A hundred years from then, today, 
Disease is rampant in third world, 
As many people huddled stay; 
HIV heralds ‘Abscess Cold'! 

There is a cure for TB now, 
As DOTS and DOTS PLUS can save most; 
Unhalted stays the disease, oh, 
As people die or it turns worst! 

Resistant strains emerge out fast, 
Though patients can be healed at home; 
No more the disease looks aghast, 
As ‘six-months' treatment is welcome! 

Yet, millions continue to die, 
Despite new drugs and early finds
Of cases, testing that can't lie, 
And cures are rather very high! 


And caused the deaths of many men, 
is growing resistant with time
To drugs that killed it earlier, fast! 

'Tis lurking still in various ways, 
And causing mortality still, 
Which can be prevented if we
Detect and treat all cases well.

This ain't the time to relax then, 
For multi-drug resistant strains
Could rise to epidemic size, 
And threaten poorer countries' folks.

The war against the TB germ
Must continue with increased verve, 
Until the bacillus is gone
From face of earth, and all mankind! 

To zero deaths from TB then
Means detecting all cases fast, 
And treating them in proper ways, 
Without one turning ev'r default! 

World TB Day this year heralds
Concerted efforts to wipe out
The growing Tuberculous menace, 
And save the mortal human race. 

The TB germ is lurking everywhere, 
And India has most cases in the world; 
Contained has been disease to some extent; 
Large population keeps the figure high.

The prevalence/ incidence have declined; 
The mortality has been curbed as well; 
MDR TB isn't a problem big; 
India is seventeenth in the burden list.


 

Perhaps. 

I see, the war  have started few days ago! 
Between me and my lover because of ego! 
May turn as world war! 
Danger danger! 
It seems some other join
Spending words, no coin.

No causalities yet but
In the air bang! thud thud! Tut tut! 

Don’t worry, just tight
Example of love's fight-


I said-
'Morning dews, burning sun, ocean's waves witness, 
You the 'you' I love most.
At any cost
Let me touch, love me much, o dear lovely princess.'

She said-
'What really want you, what kind of your love I can't get, 
Your words, Your call
Pierce me tears roll
Who are you? I wonder I wonder what's this Maya's net! '

I said-
‘Your love blinds me, always see only you o dear! 
Seeing others love to you, I am dying, can’t bear! 

She said-
‘Love of others let, 
Ever I told? - 
I do not love you, more than other, Why you revolt? 
Just try to  get, try to get! 


Thus going on-


The war
Brings tears
She cries I cry
I fear she fear
Emotions may become dry! 

Research revealed-
Tears, eliminative process
Remove toxic substances.

But I fear
If thus roll tears
Ocean may become dry
Then, how shall cry! How will cry! ! 

Oh! stop war stop war
I love you my dear!


War is hell
Hell for everyone
Started after the second one
And will not end soon
No need to rings the bell
No cease fire
The world is afire
Peace is not a piece
On the list
The bombs have been raining
On everyone
The bullets have been flying
On everyone
Wounded and dead bodies
Are everywhere
Sufferings, miseries
Are everywhere
No need to ring the bells
We are in hell
We all failed
There are no winners
Only losers
Who lost more or less
This is a chaotic mess
And many of us are praying
The drones always win
Hell for everyone
There are no clear winners
The world always lost
Gamblers are no winners
They may win the coin toss
But are still sore losers
At the end of the game
This is a darn shame
War is no darling game
War is about killing, bombing
Hurting, shooting, and destroying
War is about wasting lives
About killing spouses 
Crying and weeping wives
Burning houses
Killing women
Shooting children
Bombing young men
Torturing old men
Wounded and dead bodies
Are everywhere
Losing our humanities
And wasting our future. 


World was in the face of the beloved--,
but suddenly it poured out and was gone:
world is outside, world can not be grasped.

Why didn't I, from the full, beloved face
as I raised it to my lips, why didn't I drink
world, so near that I couldn't almost taste it?

Ah, I drank. Insatiably I drank.
But I was filled up also, with too much
world, and, drinking, I myself ran over.




For Alexander there was no Far East,
Because he thought the Asian continent
India ended. Free Cathay at least
Did not contribute to his discontent.

But Newton, who had grasped all space, was more
Serene. To him it seemed that he'd but played
With several shells and pebbles on the shore
Of that profundity he had not made.

Swiss Einstein with his relativity -
With the cosmos and its activity.
Religionless equations won't suffice. 


I feel the ground crumbling beneath our feet, 
I love you and I grab for an edge but only air do my hands meet, 
But as we fall, do you have any care for us at all? 

You see the free-fall path we are taking, 
Yet you blindly continue without an instant of hesitating! 

You do nothing to try and stop our fate, 
Please grab my hand before it’s too late, 

I love you but, 
I worry for the ground I can see.



Worry is a growth upon the mind: 
A parasite – a tick or mite; a nick, 
A churning gut – metaphors combined, 
Rotting down a delicate constitution.

Anxiety, an intumescent whore: 
A siren for a metastatic state; 
Psychological rent – a weeping sore.
Hopelesly, you die for restitution.


I lie down in my bed and wrestle with my angel.

My bank-manager could not sanction my continuance for another day
But life itself wakes me each morning, and love

Urges me to give although I have no money
In the bank at this moment, and ought properly

To cease to exist in a world where poverty
Is a shameful and ridiculous offence.


Having no one to advise me, I open the Book
And shut my eyes and put my finger on a text

And read that the widow with the young son
Must give first to the prophetic genius
From the little there is in the bin of flour and the cruse of oil.



Delight me, 
adore me, 
write me songs full of love.

Respect me, 
rapport me, 
put no woman above.

Be my mighty war'ior
and you, I will adhere.
I will clean your wounds gently
If it is I, you revere.



Worship me
and I, you.
Love me
and I, you.

Kind knight, 
enjoy me.
Worship me.
explore me. 



Old wortermelon time is a-comin' round again,
And they ain't no man a-livin' any tickleder'n me,
Fer the way I hanker after wortermelons is a sin--
Which is the why and wharefore, as you can plainly see.

Oh! it's in the sandy soil wortermelons does the best,
And it's thare they'll lay and waller in the sunshine and
the dew
Tel they wear all the green streaks clean off of theyr
breast;
And you bet I ain't a-findin' any fault with them; ain't
you?

They ain't no better thing in the vegetable line;
And they don't need much 'tendin', as ev'ry farmer
knows;
And when theyr ripe and ready fer to pluck from the vine,
I want to say to you theyr the best fruit that grows.

It's some likes the yeller-core, and some likes the red.
And it's some says 'The Little Californy' is the best;
But the sweetest slice of all I ever wedged in my head,
Is the old 'Edingburg Mounting-sprout,' of the west

You don't want no punkins nigh your wortermelon
vines--
'Cause, some-way-another, they'll spile your melons,
shore;--
I've seed 'em taste like punkins, from the core to the rines,
Which may be a fact you have heerd of before

But your melons that's raised right and 'tended to with
care,
You can walk around amongst 'em with a parent's
pride and joy,
And thump 'em on the heads with as fatherly a air
As ef each one of them was your little girl er boy.

I joy in my hart jest to hear that rippin' sound
When you split one down the back and jolt the halves
in two,
And the friends you love the best is gethered all around--
And you says unto your sweethart, 'Oh, here's the
core fer you!'

And I like to slice 'em up in big pieces fer 'em all,
Espeshally the childern, and watch theyr high delight
As one by one the rines with theyr pink notches falls,
And they holler fer some more, with unquenched
appetite.


Boys takes to it natchurl, and I like to see 'em eat--
A slice of wortermelon's like a frenchharp in theyr
hands,
And when they 'saw' it through theyr mouth sich music
can't be beat--
'Cause it's music both the sperit and the stummick
understands.

Oh, they's more in wortermelons than the purty-colored
meat,
And the overflowin' sweetness of the worter squshed
betwixt

The up'ard and the down'ard motions of a feller's teeth,
And it's the taste of ripe old age and juicy childhood
mixed.

Fer I never taste a melon but my thoughts flies away
To the summertime of youth; and again I see the dawn,
And the fadin' afternoon of the long summer day,
And the dusk and dew a-fallin', and the night a-comin'
on.

And thare's the corn around us, and the lispin' leaves and
trees,
And the stars a-peekin' down on us as still as silver
mice,
And us boys in the wortermelons on our hands and knees,
And the new-moon hangin' ore us like a yeller-cored
slice.

Oh! it's wortermelon time is a-comin' round again,
And they ain't no man a-livin' any tickleder'n me,
Fer the way I hanker after wortermelons is a sin--
Which is the why and wharefore, as you can plainly see. 


Come, Prudence, you have done enough to--day--
The worst is over, and some hours of play
We both have earned, even more than rest, from toil;
Our minds need laughter, as a spent lamp oil,
And after their long fast a recompense.
How sweet the evening is with its fresh scents
Of briar and fern distilled by the warm wind!
How green a robe the rain has left behind!
How the birds laugh!--What say you to a walk
Over the hill, and our long promised talk
About the rights and wrongs of infancy?
Our patients are asleep, dear angels, she
Holding the boy in her ecstatic arms,
As mothers do, and free from past alarms,
The child grown calm. If we, an hour or two,
Venture to leave them, 'tis but our hope's due.
My tongue is all agog to try its speed
To a new listener, like a long--stalled steed
Loosed in a meadow, and the Forest lies
At hand, the theme of its best flatteries.
See, Prudence, here, your hat, where it was thrown
The night you found me in the house alone
With my worst fear and these two helpless things.
And we may let our thoughts on pleasure run
Some moments in the light of this good sun.
They sleep in Heaven's guard. Our watch to--night
Will be the braver for a transient sight--
The only one perhaps more fair than they--
Of Nature dressed for her June holiday.

This is the watershed between the Thames
And the South coast. On either hand the streams
Run to the great Thames valley and the sea,
The Downs, which should oppose them, servilely
Giving them passage. Who would think these Downs,
Which look like mountains when the sea--mist crowns
Their tops in autumn, were so poor a chain?
Yet they divide no pathways for the rain,
Nor store up waters, in this pluvious age,
More than the pasteboard barriers of a stage.
The crest lies here. From us the Medway flows
To drain the Weald of Kent, and hence the Ouse
Starts for the Channel at Newhaven. Both
These streams run eastward, bearing North and South.
But, to the West, the Adur and the Arun
Rising together, like twin rills of Sharon,
Go forth diversely, this through Shoreham gap,
And that by Arundel to Ocean's lap.
All are our rivers, by our Forest bred,
And one besides which with more reverend heed
We need to speak, for her desert is great
Beyond the actual wealth of her estate.
For Spenser sang of her, the River Mole,
And Milton knew her name, though he, poor soul,
Had never seen her, as I think being blind,
And so miscalled her sullen. Others find
Her special merit to consist in this:
A maiden coyness, and her shy device
Of mole--like burrowing. And in truth her way
Is hollowed out and hidden from the day,
Under deep banks and the dark overgrowth
Of knotted alder roots and stumps uncouth,
From source to mouth; and once at Mickleham,
She fairly digs her grave, in deed and name,
And disappears. There is an early trace
Of this propensity to devious ways
Shown by the little tributary brook
Which bounds our fields, for lately it forsook
Its natural course, to burrow out a road
Under an ash tree in its neighbourhood.
But whether this a special virtue is,
Or like some virtues but a special vice,
We need not argue. This at least is true,
That in the Mole are trout, and many too,
As I have often proved with rod and line
From boyhood up, blest days of pins and twine!
How many an afternoon have our hushed feet
Crept through the alders where the waters meet,
Mary's and mine, and our eyes viewed the pools
Where the trout lay, poor unsuspecting fools,
And our hands framed their doom,--while overhead
His orchestra of birds the backbird led.
In those lost days, no angler of them all
Could boast our cunning with the bait let fall,
Close to their snouts, from some deceiving coigne,
Or mark more notches when we stopped to join
Our fishes head to tail and lay them out
Upon the grass, and count our yards of trout.
'Twas best in June, with the brook growing clear
After a shower, as now. In dark weather
It was less certain angling, for the stream
Was truly sullen'' then, so deep and dim.
'Tis thus in mountain lakes, as some relate,
Where the fish need the sun to see the bait.
The fly takes nothing in these tangled brooks,
But grief to fishermen and loss of hooks;
And all our angling was of godless sort,
With living worm,--and yet we loved the sport.

But wait. This path will lead us to the gill,
Where you shall see the Mole in her first rill,
Ere yet she leaves the Forest, and her bed
Is still of iron--stone, which stains her red,
Yet keeps her pure and lends a pleasant taste
To her young waters as they bubble past.
You hear her lapping round the barren flanks
Of these old heaps we call the Cinder--banks,''
Where our forefathers forged their iron ore,
When Paul's was building. Now, the rabbits bore
In the still nights, beneath these ancient heaps,
A very honeycomb. See, where she peeps,
The infant river. You could hardly wet
Your ankles in her midmost eddy yet.
She has a pretty cunning in her look
Mixed with alarm, as in her secret nook
We find her out, half fugitive, half brave,
A look that all the Forest creatures have.
Let us away. Perhaps her guilelessness
Is troubled at a guilty human face,
(Mine, Prudence,--not your own). I know a dell
Knee deep in fern, hard by, the very cell
For an elf hermit. Here stag--mosses grow,
Thick as a coverlet, and fox--gloves blow
Purple and white, and the wild columbine,
And here in May there springs that thing divine,
The lily of the valley, only here
Found in the Forest, blossoming year on year;
A place o'ershadowed by a low--crowned oak.
The enchanted princess never had been woke
If she had gone to sleep in such a spot,
In spite of fortune. Why, a corpse forgot
Might lie, with eyes appealing to the sky,
Unburied here for half a century.
And this the woodcocks, as I take it, knew,
Who stayed to breed here all the summer through,
When other birds were gone. I flushed a pair
On the longest day last year; the nest was there;
And found some egg--shells chipped among the moss.
The sight is rarer now than once it was.

There! We have gathered breath and climbed the hill,
And now can view the landscape more at will.
This is the Pilgrim road, a well--known track,
When folk did all their travelling on horseback,
Now long deserted, yet a right of way,
And marked on all our maps with due display.
Beneath this yew--tree, which perhaps has seen
Our fathers riding to St. Thomas' shrine,
(For this was once the way of pilgrimage
From the south--west for all who would engage
Their vows at Canterbury), we will sit,
As doubtless they too sat, and rest a bit.
I love this solitude of birch and fern,
These quags and mosses, and I love the stern
Black yew--trees and the hoary pastures bare,
Or tufted with long growths of withered hair
And rank marsh grass. I love the bell--heath's bloom,
And the wild wealth which passionate Earth's womb
Throws in the Forest's lap to clothe unseen
Its ancient barrenness with youth and green.
I love the Forest; 'tis but this one strip
Along the watershed that still dares keep
Its title to such name. Yet once wide grown
A mighty woodland stretched from Down to Down,
The last stronghold and desperate standing--place
Of that indigenous Britannic race
Which fell before the English. It was called
By Rome Anderida,'' in Saxon Weald.''
Time and decay, and Man's relentless mood,
Have long made havock of the lower wood
With axe and plough; and now, of all the plain,
These breadths of higher ground alone remain,
In token of its presence. Who shall tell
How long, in these lost wilds of brake and fell,
Or in the tangled groves of oak below,
Gathering his sacred leaf, the mistletoe,
Some Druid priest, forgotten and in need,
May here have kept his rite and owned his creed
After the rest? For hardly yet less rude,
Here later dwelt that patron of our wood,
The last authentic dragon England knew;
A man of prayer and penitential vows,
Whose tale survives in many a forest house.
For, having slain his monster, he was given
To choose whate'er he would in gift from Heaven,
And took for his sole recompense this thing:
Snakes should not bite, nor nightingales should sing
Within the Forest precincts.'' Thus, thought he,
His orisons should unmolested be
By mundane joys and troubles. Yonder ridge,
Cutting the sky--line at the horizon's edge,
Is the Surrey Hills. Beneath the chalk pit, set
Like a white cloud upon the face of it,
Lies Dorking, famed for fowls, and, further still,
Wotton and Shere. In front you have Leith Hill,
Which looks upon St. Paul's and on the sea,
A point of note in our geography.
All this is Evelyn's land, who long ago
Left us his record of the vale below
And wrote the Silva'' now to hands as good
Passed, the descendant's of his name and blood,
That doughty squire's, who lately stood in fight
With the new dragons of the Primrose rite,
And broke a lance for Ireland and the cause
Of freedom, flouted by coercion laws.
Strange change! For long in history these same hills
Were held as ominous of lowland ills,
A source of robber fear, in foul repute,
And natural fortress since the days of Knute,
And earlier still when Saxon Sussex stood
A home--ruled kingdom of primaeval wood.
A camp, an eagle's nest, a foot set down
Into the Weald, and evil of renown
With the free dwellers of the plain, who saw
A menace brooding of imperial law.
Saxon or Dane or Norman, each in turn,
Set there his camp to pillage and to burn;
For history, just as now, was mainly then
A tale of wars 'twixt regiments and men.
We, forest dwellers, show with honest boast
Our Slaughter Bridge, where the Norse horde was lost,
Drowned in the red Mole waters, when the Dane
Fled from his eyrie, nor returned again.

The farthest point of all, and looking west,
Is the line of Hindhead, on whose triple crest,
With a good glass, a three--inch telescope,
You might make out the cross upon the top:
It used to be a gibbet. As a child
What tales I treasured of that headland wild,
With its three murderers, who in chains there hung,
Rocked by the winds and tempest--tossed and swung!
Three Portsmouth sailors were they who their mate
Murdered for gold and grog, which guineas get,
And in the Punch Bowl'' made their brute carouse,
Leaving him dead, in a lone public--house,
Where retribution seized them as was due,--
For in that age of simple faiths and true
Murder did always out,--and so apace
Brought them to justice in that self--same place;
And many years they hung. At last its sway
Humanity, that child of yesterday,
Asserted in their case, and craved their bones
I half regret the leniency thus lent:
Their gallows--tree was their best monument;
But ours is a trim age. There, farther down,
Is a tower, or folly,'' built of late by one
We call in these parts Chevalier de Malt,''
(The brewers love high places, and no fault).
Behind us the chief ridge. And, as I speak,
Out of its bowels, with an angry shriek,
And rushing down the valley at our feet,
The train has found us out in our retreat.
It came from Balcombe tunnel and is bound
To be in London ere an hour is round.
It scarcely scares our solitude away;
And yonder Royston crows, the black and grey,
Sit on unmoved upon their oak. This ridge
Is only thirty miles from London Bridge,
And, when the wind blows north, the London smoke
Comes down upon us, and the grey crows croak,
For the great city seems to reach about
With its dark arms, and grip them by the throat.
Time yet may prove them right. The wilderness
May be disforested, and Nature's face
Stamped out of beauty by the heel of Man,
Who has no room for beauty in his plan.

Such things may be, for things as strange have been.
This very place, where peace and sylvan green
And immemorial silence and the mood
Of solemn Nature, virgin and unwooed,
Seem as a heritage,--this very place
Was once the workshop of a busy race
Which dug and toiled and sweated. Here once stood,
Amid the blackened limbs of tortured wood,
And belching smoke and fury from its mouth,
A monstrous furnace, to whose jaws uncouth
A race as monstrous offered night and day
The Forest's fairest offspring for a prey.
Here stood a hamlet, black and populous,
With human sins and sorrows in each house,
A mining centre. Which of us could guess
Each yew--tree yonder marks a dwelling--place
Of living men and women?--nay, a tomb?
Of all the secrets hidden in Earth's womb,
None surely is more pitiful and strange
Than this of human death and human change
Amid the eternal greenness of the Spring.
All we may guess of what the years shall bring,
Is this: that about April every year,
White blossoms shall burst forth upon the pear
And pink upon the apple. Nothing else.
Earth has a silent mockery which repels
Our questioning. Her history is not ours,
And overlays it with a growth of flowers.

Ah, Prudence, you who wonder, being town bred,
What troubles grieve us in the lives we lead,
What cause we have for sorrow in these fields
Whose beauty girds us with its thousand shields,--
This is our tragedy. You cannot know,
In your bald cities, where no cowslips blow,
How dear life is to us. The tramp of feet
Brushes all older footsteps from the street,
And you see nothing of the graves you tread.
With us they are still present, the poor dead,
And plead with us each day of life, and cry
Did I not love my life, I too, even I?''
You wonder!--Wonder rather we are not
All touched with madness and disease of thought,
Being so near the places where they sleep
Who sowed these fields we in their absence reap.
It were more logical. And here in truth
No few of our Weald peasants in their youth
Lose their weak wits, or in their age go mad,
Brooding on sights the world had deemed most glad.
I have seen many such. The Hammer Ponds,
So frequent in the Forest's outer bounds,
Have all their histories of despairing souls
Brought to their depths to find their true life's goals.
You see one in the hollow, where the light
Touches its blackness with a gleam of white,
Deep down, and over--browed with sombre trees
Shutting its surface primly from the breeze,
The landscape's innocent eye, set open wide
To watch the heavens,--yet with homicide
Steeped to the lids. 'Tis scarce a year ago
The latest sufferer from our rural woe
Found there his exit from a life too weak
To shield him from despairs he dared not speak.
A curious lad. I knew young Marden well,
Brought up, a farmer's son, at the plough's tail,
And used for all romance to mind the crows
At plain day--wages in his father's house.
A natural'' he, and weak in intellect,
His fellows said, nor lightly to be pricked
To industry at any useful trade;
His wits would go wool--gathering in the shade
At harvest time, when all had work on hand,
Nor, when you spoke, would seem to understand.
At times his choice would be for days together
To leave his work and idle in the heather,
Making his bed where shelter could be found
Under the fern--stacks or on open ground,
Or oftenest in the charcoal burners' hives,
When he could win that pity from their wives.
Poor soul! He needed pity, for his face,
Scarred by a burn, and reft of human grace,
And for his speech, which faltering in his head
Made a weak babble of the words he said.
His eyes too--what a monster's! did you ever
Watch a toad's face at evening by a river
And note the concentrated light which lies
In the twin topazes men call his eyes?
Like these were Marden's. From the square of clay
Which was his face, these windows of his day
Looked out in splendour, but with a fixed stare
Which made men start who missed the meaning there.
Yet he had thoughts. Not seldom he and I
Made in these woods discourse of forestry,
Walking together, I with dog and gun,
He as a beater, or, if game was none,
Marking the timber trees and underwoods.
He knew each teller in these solitudes,
And loved them with a quite unreasoned art,
Learned from no teacher but his own wild heart.
Of trees he quaintly talked in measured saws
Which seemed the decalogue of Nature's laws,
Its burden being as erst, Thou shalt not kill''
For larch and fir, newcomers from the North,
He pleaded scantly when their doom went forth,
Knowing they needs must die, and the birch stems,
Since Spring renews them, yet with stratagems
Framed to delay the moment of their fate.
For beech he battled with more keen debate
Of hand and eye, in deprecating tone,
Holding their rights coeval with our own.
But when we came to oak, good Sussex oak,
The flame burst forth, and all his being spoke
In words that jostled in his throat with tears,
An oak which might outlive a thousand years.''
He held this sacrilege. Perhaps some strains
Of Druid blood were mingled in his veins,
Which gave authority to guard the tree
Sacred of yore, and thus he vanquished me.

How came he to his end, poor Marden? Well,
All stories have their reason, as some tell,
In Eves that give the fruit for which men grieve,
Or, what is often worse, refuse to give.
This last was Marden's unprotected case,
Whose virtue failed him, and his ugliness,
To escape the common fate of all mankind.
He fell in love egregious and purblind,
Just like the wisest. She who caused his flame
Was not, I think, in honesty to blame
If she was less than serious at his suit.
Marden, as lover, was grotesquely mute,
And his strange eyes were not the orbs to move
A maiden's fancy to a dream of love.
In truth they were scarce human. Still 'twas hard
His passion should be met, for sole reward,
With sermon phrases and such gospel talk
As preachers license for a Sunday walk,
Mixed with her laughter. This was all she gave,
An endless course of things beyond the grave,
Till he lost reckoning and, poor witless man,
Began to reason on the cosmic plan,
Which meted this scant mercy in his case,
And placed him in such straits for happiness.
Can you not see it? All our rustics live
In their small round of thoughts as in a hive,
Each cell they build resembling each each day,
Till their wits swarm, and then they are away.
Through a deep slough of black theology,
Which ended in destruction and this pool,
With Hell beyond him for his poor dumb soul.
He sought her final pity for love lost.
She talked of Heaven, and sent him tracts by post.
He pleaded. She reproved. She prayed. He swore.
She bade him go. He went, and came no more.
Such was the history, no whit uncommon.
I neither blame the boy nor blame the woman,
Only the hardness of a fate which laid
Its iron flail upon too weak a head.
She watched him go, half doubting what would come,
Her last tract crushed betwixt his angry thumb
And his clenched fingers, and his lips grown white,
And his eyes gleaming with their maniac light,
And so towards the hill. That afternoon,
The last of a late autumn, saw the sun
Set in unusual splendour (it is said
A disc of gold in a whole heaven of red),
The herald of a frost, the earliest
Known for a lifetime. There, for summer dressed,
The trees stood stiff and frozen in their green,
Belated revellers in some changing scene
Of sudden winter and June left behind.
In all the forest was no breath of wind
For a full fortnight, nor was a leaf shed
Long after Nature in her shroud lay dead,
A beautiful black frost which held the land
In unseen fetters, but with iron hand.
The pools were frozen over in the night,
Without a flaw or ripple; and their light
Reflected every stem of every tree
In perfect mirrors of transparency.
Boys, who a week before were in the field
With bat and ball, now ventured, iron--heeled,
On the ice skating, yet awhile in fear,
Seeing no footing on the water there.
And thus it fell about the corpse was found
(You will have guessed it) in the ice fast bound.
Two boys, the brothers of the girl he wooed,
Tired of their pastime stopped awhile and stood
Over a shallow place where rushes grow,
And peering down saw a man's face below
Watching their own (his eyes were open laid,
Fixed in that terrible stare poor Marden's had);
And thought they saw a vision. Running back,
Loud in their fear, with spectres on their track,
They spread the news through all the frightened farms,
Filling the cottagers with wild alarms,
Till some made bold with spades, and hewed away
The ice above to where the dead man lay.
There, sure enough, was Marden, his fool's mouth
Stuffed for all solace of his sad soul's drouth
With the girl's tracts. Thus primed, he had plunged in
And ended all, with a last deed of sin,
Grotesque and tragic as his life. No less
Let us persuaded be he rests in peace,
Or where were Heaven's justice? One last tale,
As we walk back,--of worthy Master Gale,
Our house's founder, who in a dark age
Won us the lands we hold in heritage,
Working his forge here in the civil wars,
And welding fortunes out of iron bars.
A story with a moral too, at least,
For money makers, of how wealth increased,
And most of all for us, to whom his toil
Has proved a mine of ease and endless spoil,
Though of a truth we are unlineal heirs,
Not true descendants of his toils and cares.
His history stands recorded in a book
Himself achieved, ere Death his anvil broke,
Trust in himself, and scorn of human ways.

He was a blacksmith, born at Sevenoke
In Kent, the toilsome son of toilsome folk,
And honourable too, as honour then
Was understood among commercial men.
He paid his way through life. He owed to none
Beyond their will to let the debt run on,
Nor trusted any farther than he need.
He held the race of man a bastard breed,
An evil generation, bred of dust,
And prone to spending, idleness and lust.
How he should make new ventures with new luck,
Praying each night continuance of health,
Increase of wisdom and increase of wealth;
Nor ever in his yearly balance sheet
Forgot to inscribe himself in Heaven's debt.
A virtuous man, and holding with good cause
The eternal justice of the social laws
Which give to industry its well--earned meed,
And leave the weak and idle to their need.
From childhood up, he clutched the staff of life,
As if it were a cudgel for the strife,
And wielded it throughout relentlessly.
Died of the plague when he was scarce sixteen.
The date, as I have reckoned, should have been
The very year the patriots raised their backs
To the new pressure of the shipping tax.
His first fight was a battle for the pence
Left by his father, when, at dire expense
Of lawyers' fees and charges without end,
He found himself with fifty pounds to spend,
And a small stock--in--trade of iron sows,
A fireless smithy and an empty house.
To strike and blow for him, his trade began,
Till in four years his industry had grown
To a fair substance in his native town.

When he was twenty--one, an accident
Brought him to Sussex; and, as Saul was sent
To find his father's asses and therewith
Met with a kingdom, so this honest smith,
While chasing a bad debtor through the Weald,
Lit on his fortune in this very field.
For, failing of his money, in its stead
He took his debtor's forge and smelting shed;
Sold his goodwill at Sevenoke, and set
His smithy in the Forest next to it.
This brought him trade. The civil wars began
And each man's hand was set against each man,
And sword to sword. But, while his neighbours fought,
Gale, like a Gallio, cared for these things nought,
And sold his iron with indifferent zeal
To kings and Parliaments in need of steel;
Or, if a prejudice his thought divides,
Who to His servant Gale such grace had shown!

Thus, in an iron age, this thrifty man
Got gold and silver, and, while others ran
Out of their fortunes, he with pockets full
Bought up their lands and held the world a fool.
'Tis now two hundred years since Father Gale
Laid down his pick and hammer. He had won,
By forty years of toil beneath the sun,
The right to work no longer, for himself
And for his heirs for ever. This is Wealth!
He was a prudent buyer, and died possessed
Of some four thousand acres of the best
Land in the parish. His first purchases
Were in Worth Forest, to his vulgar eyes
I fear mere wood for burning. Pease--pottage
And Frog's--hole farms came next; and in his age,
Wishing, as he says, to have a good estate
And house to live in, though the day was late
To think of building, and he most abhorred
To waste his substance upon brick and board,
Holding with prudent minds that such intent
Is but at best a sweet impoverishment''
And that the wise man doth more soundly hit
Who turns another's folly to his wit,
He purchased Caxtons, manor and domain,
To be the home of a new race of men.

His last words, as recorded by his son,
A man of taste and letters and who won
A seat in Parliament in William's reign,
Were uttered in the ancient Biblic strain
Dear to the age he lived in and to him.
They might be David's in their cadence grim.
When I am dead and gone,'' he said, my son,
Be wary of thy neighbours. They are vile,
A brood of vipers, to oppose whose guile
I have been at constant charges all my life.
Take thee an honest woman for thy wife,
And get thee sons who shall inherit all
Guard well thy rights, and cease not to pull down
All gates that block thy highway to the town,
Such as that man of Belial, Jacob Sears
Has set in Crawley Lane these thirty years.
Let no man venture to enclose the wastes.
Be on thy guard against such ribald priests
As Lee and Troughton. They are an ill brood,
A bastard generation, bone and blood.
Hold fast to thy religion. Go not thou
After lewd women and the worldly show
Of rich apparel. Keep thy substance close
In thy own chamber for the fear of loss,
And thy own counsel closer, lest men find
Their way to rob thee of thy peace of mind.
But, more than all, be quit of vain pretence,
And see thy income equal thy expense,

Thus runs the story. You have seen to--day
The latest shoot of his posterity,
The boy we left there sleeping. His shall be
One day the guardianship of this domain,
As other Gales have held it. It were vain
In me to speak of all the goodly fruit
Begotten on the stem of this old root,
This sour crab--apple, worthy master Gale.
This child perhaps. . . . But that will be a tale
For new historians. Listen! Did you hear
Just now, down in the valley, someone cheer
Or hail us? Stop. Ay, there there comes a man,
Running and shouting loud as a man can.
He sees us too, and slowly through the fern
Now climbs to meet us. Something we shall learn
And yet he seems to falter and stand still.
What is your message, Penfold? Why this haste?
A little closer. Speak man! Here at last
You have found us. Come. What is it that you said!
See, we have courage. Sir, the child is dead!'


'worthless is the woman
who is fickle and fancy free
controlled by lust
and its filthiness
she walks a troubled path
worthless is the woman
who cannot give pleasure
or accept pain
worthless is the woman
who paints her face
just to hide her shame
worthless is the woman
who is
afraid of love


I waz walking down Wyefront street
When me trousers ran away,
I waz feeling incomplete
But still me trousers would not stay,
When I found where they had gone
De pair addressed me rather blunt,
And they told me they were sick of being put on
Back to front. 

I told dem I would treat dem good
And wear dem back to back,
I promised dem protection
From a friend who is a mac,
Me trousers did not believe a single word I had to say,
And me underpants were laughing
When me trousers ran away.





One year ago I wished that I
A banker great might be
With a hundred million dollars
And financial majesty;

A mighty Wall Street banker
With a whopping lot of power
And an income of somewhere around
A thousand plunks per hour;

A solid Wall Street banker
With securities in sacks
And with clever men to show me
How to pay no income tax;

A wealthy Wall Street banker
Who raked in cash like hay;
I wished that just a year ago—
And I wish the same today. 


Flies ZOOM across the room, 
Then with one sneaky snap, 
The flies become breakfast
For the Venus flytrap! 

YO! The Venus flytrap! 
YO! The Venus flytrap! 

Another fly must die
And flap its final flap, 
Blood and guts for breakfast
For the Venus flytrap! 

YO! The Venus flytrap! 
YO! The Venus flytrap! 

Eats a piece of Fly-Pie
And then he takes a nap! 
A nap after breakfast
For the Venus flytrap! 

Snappin’ and clappin’
With a ZING and a ZAP! 
Flappin’ and nappin’
And yappin’ as we tap 
a-rap-rap-rappin’


YO! The Venus flytrap

When first
introduced to

the good old
US of A

not everyone
was sufficiently aware

of how
to make it.

So one would be
served
the leaves

with either
sugar or syrup

on top.

The boiled water
thrown away. 


Would you still love me? 
would you want me? 
Would you dream of me every night? 

Would you remember me? 
would you miss me? 
if I weren't holding you tight! 

Would you long for me, 
would you come to me, 
every morning, in every breath, 

now that my body's
 frigid cold

.  . 

and my soul is all that's left

You cut my dreams to pieces
And scattered them in the wind


I have so many wounds
big ones
small ones
and all different sorts
cuts, scratches, bruises, bleeding
but the biggest wound i have
is inside.
it's the deepest
longest one i have.
you were so gracious to give it to me
you shattered every ounce of me
i thought i was going to die
but then i just pulled the knife from my heart
and put a band-aid on it
i will go on.



My wounds don’t heal, 
Get real that I have to deal with this, 
Known as the girl that got hurt, 
Known as a nobody, 
My wounds haven’t even covered or be healed, 
Its just a memory I understand that, 
But my wounds haven’t heal yet, 
Knowing that I was raped, hurt, broken hearted, feeling lonely, 
But I am not lonely no more I have someone that’s there for me and I understand that the fact that he loves me and I love him, 
Even thou only time can tell, 
But did time fixed my wounds, 
Did time fixed the hurt I feel, 
No I don’t think so, 
I feel as if I where a ghost, 
Ghost of the past, 
My wounds might heal but the past haunts me. 

You say I'm just a silent whisper, 
far away steps in a dark valley, 
an empty gaze to the space, 
and still you see me standing here, 
am I waiting or walking away? 

You hear a permanent sound in the distance
and feel an emotion taking your breath, 
precise metronome giving you the way, 
my heart is beating, could you reach it from there? 
A strong wind, I'm facing the gales
I am here, are you there? 
Steps in the distance, 
I now know for sure, 
woven together, 
are my dreams and yours. 



absorbed, all wrapped, 
To take off the sheets
seems so hard, 
to catch a glimpse
of your face, 
so far. 

But 
I start off
a rite of unpacking: 
paper, cotton shirt, skin, 
looking for your heart, lost, 
in printing ink and wrapping. 


Who remembers whom

When one goes beyond reach? 

Day by day till memory is

Alive and kicking

One talks of the one gone

By an by a mere passing thought

Is all that remains

And later time casts its net

And time wipes away all the traces

Of the loved and the hated alike

 

No place to grieve

No room for guilt

It’s just the way

In this endless profession

And procession of life

 


Grapes of wrath are sore
When your mind filled by envy
Jealousy makes your mind poisonous
And darkness covers your soul.

Abrupt are your thoughts
When darkness rule your soul
Blindness rule your wisdom
And shadows replaces instead.

Goodwill washes and drains
All the miseries ahead
And Calves torn its prey
To wind up unrecognized path'


Twas in the year of  and on the h of November,
Which the surviving crew of the "Samuel Crawford" will long remember,
She was bound to Baltimore with a cargo of pine lumber;
But, alas! the crew suffered greatly from cold and hunger. 

'Twas on December d when about ten miles south-west
Of Currituck light, and scudding at her best;
That a heavy gale struck her a merciless blow,
Which filled the hearts of the crew with fear and woe. 

Then the merciless snow came down, hiding everything from view,
And as the night closed in the wind tempestuous blew;
Still the brave crew reefed the spanker and all the sails,
While not one amongst them with fear bewails. 

Still the gallant little schooner ploughed on the seas,
Through the blinding snow and the stormy breeze;
Until it increased to a fearful hurricane,
Yet the crew wrought manfully and didn't complain. 

But during the night the wind it harder blew,
And the brave little schooner was hove to;
And on the morning of December the h the wind died out,
But it rent the schooner from stem to stern without any doubt. 

And the seas were running mountains high,
While the poor sailors, no doubt, heaved many a sigh;
Because they must have felt cold, and the schooner sprung a leak,
Still they wrought while their hearts were like to break. 

Then the wind it sprang up in terrific fury again,
But the crew baled out the water with might and main;
But still the water fast on them did gain,
Yet the brave heroes disdained to complain. 

On the morning of December the h she was scudding before a hurricane,
And the crew were exhausted, but managed the poop to gain;
And the vessel was tossed like a cork on the wave,
While the brave crew expected to meet with a watery grave. 

And huge beams and pine planks were washed overboard,
While Captain Tilton looked on and said never a word;
And the crew likewise felt quite content,
Until the fore-and-aft rigging overboard went. 

And to their earnest prayer He did draw nigh;
And saved them from a watery grave,
When help from Him they did crave. 

Poor souls they expected to be engulfed every hour,
And to appease their hunger they made dough with salt water and flour;
And made a sort of hard cake placed over a griddle hole,
To satisfy their hunger, which, alas! is hard to thole. 

And two of these cakes each man got per day,
Which the poor creatures devoured in a ravenous way;
Along with a little fresh water to wash it down,

And on the h of December when they had burned their last light,
The ship "Orinoco" bound for New York hove in sight;
And they were rescued safely and taken on board,

Then the Captain of the "Orinoco" ordered her to be set on fire,
Which was quickly done as he did desire;
Which caused the rescued crew to stare in amaze,
And to take the last look of their schooner in a blaze.


Minutes things now pinch me hard 
As I learn to search the hidden 
Meanings kept under words 
Deeds are a show, behind them 
The real intentions, conspired 
And hatched in the green-room 
Pierce my heart as I come to know 
Since the time I think deep 
Days just before starting of my writing 
I did not know how to read the real motive
In between the wrinkled lines of their faces 
Or I did not care or did not give them a damn 
Now I wonder how I spent my life 
Among the crooks and run the paths  
With thousand barbs



Sometimes I can't wait until I look like Nadezhda Mandelstam.


My friends are tired.
The ones who are married are tired
of being married.
The ones who are single are tired
of being single.

They look at their wrinkles.
The ones who are single attribute their wrinkles
to being single.
The ones who are married attribute their wrinkles
to being married.

They have very few wrinkles.
Even taken together,
they have very few wrinkles.
But I cannot persuade them
to look at their wrinkles
collectively.
& I cannot persuade them that being married
or being single
has nothing to do with wrinkles.

Each one sees a deep & bitter groove,
a San Andreas fault across her forehead.


"It is only a matter of time
before the earthquake"


They trade the names of plastic surgeons
like recipes.

My friends are tired.
The ones who have children are tired
of having children.
The ones who are childless are tired
of being childless.

They love their wrinkles.
If only their were deeper
they could hide.

Sometimes I think
(but do not dare to tell them)
that when the face is left alone to dig its grave,
the soul is grateful
& rolls in.

Do not mind the obvious grammatical errors
Ignore the misspellings of the words
Poetry is about expressing the terrors
And chasing the demons with their swords.

Write your poems, read your personal Bible
Be cautious, no matter what you're liable
You must fight daily your enemies
And you must defeat many small armies.

Poetry is your way out of the dungeon
You are brave, strong and a smart surgeon
Of the words. Express yourself like an orator
Be bold, fair and just, and love the Creator.

Ignore the shenanigans and the copycats
Be yourself so you can win all fights
Poetry is about telling it like it is
And it is also about saying it with great ease.

You can improve your skills by reading other Poets
You will succeed because you cannot stand the puppets
Poetry is about changing and protecting the environment
And it also about love, liberty and the freedom to be different. 


Green was culture, Green were you.
After a revolt, after a red, 
You have become black, 
Your culture black.
Perhaps, I will write in black.

Hip pop, hip hop, Bi pop, 
Jockey tight, body loose.
Loose is the costume, 
Loose is your future.
It is thy culture.

I get up in heat, 
Tightening my feet, 
Empty heat, Empty Zest.
I am thirsty to change you.
Can you give me some water? 

You too get up in heat, 
Posing your fittings, 
Around your settings.
I am thirsty for water, 
You are thirsty for culture.

You forgot your origin and seed, 
While you are busy to feed need.
You want a trend, 
You want a mixture, 
Thinking change is must.

I see a mass culture building, 
At the outdoors you are kneeling.
You are kneeling with feeling, 
Begging for hybridity, 
For a culture of santry.

I was not a poet, 
But your condition made me.
I have a query for your culture, 
Will this continue in future? 
I think yes; what you say? 




The cup on the table
Getting cold of warm milk
I was awaken and you left
Opening the curtain
To come sunlight 

The last moment
The eager of sleep
Turning to other side
Get the day for more night

You know the time
I come to bed at night
The day is my night
You have no sense

Never ever dropped a word
To change yours routine 
I drink cold tea
Because of my routine


I sit down peacefully with my book.
Upon the blank page I look.
As i tap my pen patiently, patiently, 
Patiently waiting in my writing nook.

Soon ideas I begin to see, 
Like ships setting out to sea; 
And as my pen moves they flow, flow, 
Flow graciously out of me.

But today is not the same.
Ideas are stuck in my brain, 
As i sit and think, think, 
Think of something lame.

And it is to my simple shock, 
That i have no ideas in stock, 
For today I'm afraid I'm stuck, stuck, 
Stuck in a writer's block. 

Let me share with you a news
And that's about my angry muse
Snatching heart to say something
No words in tongue
No dreams in eyes
No thoughts in mind
Open pen with ink dried
I can't tell how hard I tried
Blocked brains this blankness haunts
Like a starless sky or a moonless night
Rain has showered all in vain
Neither joys speak nor does pain
My pen had once an edge like blade
Disuse has dulled my tools of trade
Where has gone my writing skill


I looked back 
And I thought
What a long way
I have come-

I looked ahead
And I thought
What a long way 
I still need to go


My destination appears nowhere in sight-
My journey remains endless-

As I lie down to rest, 
My legs feel weary, 
But Sleep, like a truant child, 
Teases my eyes, refuses to bring any comfort-

Something snaps inside me; 
My body twists and contorts in pain, 
My soul writhes in agony and the cauldron of my being shakes violently
With the force of my raging emotions.

As I hold my breath, I brace myself, 
for the birth of my new story, long, difficult, and painful


I picked up some words
From an over heaped pile
Words which impressed me most
I started writing
Seeing paper after paper
Getting filled with a deluge of words
I felt so thrilled
Like an artist looking at a painting
I viewed it casually from a distance
And saw words become colours
My prodigality with words impressed me
I gloated over my ability as a writer
Lo! A work of literature in crude form
Stood ready, willing to be chipped and shaped
All that left was to give it a form
A stroke here and there
A finishing touch! 
"It's all so damn easy
I shall keep the thing aside
Ample time lies ahead
I can now relax, take a break"
I said to myself, self complacent


Days slipped by, months rolled away
One day I took out the scroll
Dusting it and wiping the cobwebs away
Read through it slowly
My former illusion just faded away
Words stuck out here and there
Making no coherent sense
All I found was a jumbled, jotted mass
To me ere they looked lovely dames
Colorfully dressed up for a mega show
My eyes got dazzled by their costume
When I waited for them to fall in line
Gyrating in rhythmic steps
They stood still, a disorderly mass
Refusing to budge an inch
Unwilling to sway to a rhyme


Lost in a barren desert of words
With each grain looking similar
Lacking uniqueness
I drew the curtain until
The writer's block would be lifted

Time and again
I end up falling for them
Though the titles do tell the sad tale

When will I ever, ever
Learn to read "Writer’s Block" NEVER
Both the titles and the poems are so stale

Writers block
There’s a shock! 
They have run out of fresh things to say

Well here is a clue
Free from me to you
Then just don’t write till another day! 

It makes no sense
There’s no recompense
For any reader who gets sucked in it

If writers block comes your way
Then your poem will have nothing to say
Please don’t bother to even begin it

Have pity on readers like me
Scanning for poems hopefully
While you are sitting there safe in your home 

Though we have simple needs
We search for interesting reads
"Writers. Block" never makes a good poem! 




often it is the only
thing
between you and
impossibility.
no drink,
no woman's love,
no wealth
can
match it. 


I imagined the atmosphere would be clear,
shot with pristine light,
not this sulphurous haze,
the air ionized as before a thunderstorm.

Many have pictured a river here,
but no one mentioned all the boats,
their benches crowded with naked passengers,
each bent over a writing tablet.

I knew I would not always be a child
with a model train and a model tunnel,
and I knew I would not live forever,
jumping all day through the hoop of myself.

I had heard about the journey to the other side
and the clink of the final coin
in the leather purse of the man holding the oar,
but how could anyone have guessed

that as soon as we arrived
we would be asked to describe this place
and to include as much detail as possible—
not just the water, he insists,

rather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water,
not simply the shackles, but the rusty,
iron, ankle-shredding shackles—
and that our next assignment would be

to jot down, off the tops of our heads,
our thoughts and feelings about being dead,
not really an assignment,
the man rotating the oar keeps telling us—

think of it more as an exercise, he groans,
think of writing as a process,
a never-ending, infernal process,
and now the boats have become jammed together,

bow against stern, stern locked to bow,
and not a thing is moving, only our diligent pens.


She sits there writing in the candle light
As tears fall from her eyes nothing seems right
The letters hard to read from all the tears
Everything she writes are all about her  fears
What happend to the time when she laughed and didn't cry? 
What happend to the time when she didn't give up but try? 
Things around her feel wrong
It gets harder for her to stay strong
As she places the deep cut in her arm
There is no pain in her self harm
Her heart becomes so numb
She whips away the tears this is so dumb
She writing a letter when no one will care
Life is never going to be fair
All her love turns to hate
There won't be any going bacl thats just to late
Taking the letter in her hand
In front of the fire place she goes to stand
Setting the letter in the flame
Theres not going to be anymore shame
Taking the knife in her hand to rip the pain apart
Taking the knife and cutting out her heart.
The blood flows down to the floor
For her its just a closed door


The mirror had the crossing
In silver and gold with red petals
Of roses and some flowers
Of heavenly nature
The seduction of youth 
Flesh was made by hands
And adored for the evening
Those were the days when the city
What texture one could rub with fingers
On the air to see aroma of bygone days
Memoirs could have been written
On this bridge just by looking
At the passers by inventing stories
I picked the leaf from the tree
That had in its spaces tied
Some magic words from evil eyes
For the beloved too that passed every day
On the lonely footpath by side of stream
I painted many names on the wall of imagination
My love was my accompaniment 
The news is that long separation 
From the loved ones
I had once wished for the cup of wine
I have but I am busy
Writing myself on the wall



I went on an evening course to get an education
On the best way to write for our younger generation
How do I compose words to take them on a journey of delight
Lead them into a clear, bright day or the deepest, darkest night

First I had to learn all about the direction of my voice
An innocent child or omniscient god, I had to make a choice
Then also pick the person: first, second or third
Would my subject be realistic or in the realm of the absurd

Of course I had to have a story, technically called a plot
Although apparently there are stories where what happens just does not
'Throw in some crisp, clear dialogue', Judith said dramatically
'But go easy on the adverbs', she scolded most emphatically

I needed characters and already had one from the start
The narrator of my story was one who plays an important part
I've met some lovely people who each had a surprising tale to tell
I know we all have inside us a masterpiece that will sell, sell, sell! 



Writing shit about new snow
for the rich
is not art.




How quick the change from joy to woe!
How chequered is our lot below!
Seldom we view the prospect fair, 
Dark clouds of sorrow, pain, and care,
(Some pleasing intervals between), 
Scowl over more than half the scene.
Last week with Delia, gentle maid,
Far hence in happier fields I strayed,
While on her dear enchanting tongue
Soft sounds of grateful welcome hung,
For absence had withheld it long.
'Welcome, my long-lost love, she said,
E'er since our adverse fates decreed
That we must part, and I must mourn
Till once more blessed by thy return,
Love, on whose influence I relied
For all the transports I enjoyed,
Has played the cruel tyrant's part
And turned tormentor to my heart,
But let me hold thee to my breast,
Dear partner of my joy and rest,
And not a pain, and not a fear,
Or anxious doubt, shall enter there.'
Happy, thought I, the favoured youth,
Blessed with such undissembled truth!--
Five suns successive rose and set,
And saw no monarch in his state,
Wrapped in the blaze of majesty,
So free from every care as I.--
Next day the scene was overcast;
Such day till then I never passed,--
For on that day, relentless fate!
Delia and I must separate.
Yet ere we looked our last farewell,
From her dear lips this comfort fell:--
'Fear not that time, where'er we rove,
Or absence, shall abate my love.'
And can I doubt, my charming maid,
As unsincere what you have said?
Banished from thee to what I hate,
Dull neighbours and insipid chat,
No joy to cheer me, none in view,
But the dear hope of meeting you;
And that through passion's optic seen,
With ages interposed between;--
Blessed with the kind support you give,
'Tis by your promised truth I live;
How deep my woes, how fierce my flame,
You best may tell, who feel the same. 


If, in the month of dark December, 
 Leander, who was nightly wont 
(What maid will not the tale remember?) 
 To cross thy stream, broad Hellespont! 

If, when the wintry tempest roar'd, 
 He sped to Hero, nothing loth, 
And thus of old thy current pour'd, 
 Fair Venus! how I pity both! 

For me, degenerate modern wretch, 
 Though in the genial month of May, 
My dripping limbs I faintly stretch, 
 And think I've done a feat today. 

But since he cross'd the rapid tide, 
 According to the doubtful story, 
 And swam for Love, as I for Glory; 

'Twere hard to say who fared the best: 
 Sad mortals! thus the gods still plague you! 
He lost his labour, I my jest; 
 For he was drown'd, and I've the ague. 


You us'd me ill, and I withdrew,
Intent on satirizing you.
The Muses to my Aid I call;
They came; and told me, one and all,
That I mistook their Province quite,
They never sully'd what was bright;
And said, If Satire was my Aim,
I ought to chuse another Theme.


I heard with Anger, and Surprize;
Begg'd they'd inspire, and not advise.
In vain I begg'd--they all withdrew;
When to my Aid a Phantom flew,
And vow'd she'd give my Satire Stings,
And whisper'd some resentful Things--
Said, You delighted, all your Days,
To torture her a thousand Ways:
Bid me revenge her Cause, and mine,
And blacken you in ev'ry Line.


This I resolv'd; but still in vain--
We both must unreveng'd remain:
For I, alas! remember now,
I long ago had made a Vow,
That, should the Nine their Aid refuse,
Envy should never be my Muse. 

O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute!
Leave melodizing on this wintry day,
Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute.
Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute
Betwixt damnation and impassioned clay
Must I burn through; once more humbly assay
The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit.
Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion,
Begetters of our deep eternal theme,
When through the old oak Forest I am gone,
Let me not wander in a barren dream,
But when I am consumed in the Fire,
Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire. 

To you, Athenians, we again submit;
Reward, or punish us, as you think fit.
Let Idleness, unpity'd, meet Disgrace;
For Idleness, this Year, is doubly base.
This is the aera, this the destin'd Year,
For Arts and Sciences to flourish here.
The Muses, exil'd long, to Court repair;
And--strange to think! are all the Fashion there.

Who feels not now a gen'rous Emulation,
When Merit raises to the highest Station?
Scholars may surely hope a better Fate,
Whilst Carteret directs the Helm of State.
O would he govern here by Grecian Rules,
And chuse a Senate, to preside o'er Schools;
Honour, alone, to pay the glorious Task,
(A Recompence no Foreigner would ask!)
Then kind Britannia, doubtless, would consent,
Hibernia should supply a President.


Too oft, alas! are Talents misapply'd,
By Parents Fondness, Ignorance, and Pride.
This Grievance then would cease, and we should be
Regarded, as the Publick's Property:
Genius alone would be consulted then,
(The only Way to make us useful Men)
And each would have his sev'ral Task assign'd,
As Nature gave the Biass to his Mind.

Boys of a brutal, cruel Disposition,
Should go to Spain, to serve the Inquisition.
O what a Change in Landlords would appear!
Next Age, not one would rack his Tenants here.

The Lads, who study but to dress and dance,
Should cultivate their Worthlesness in France.

Those who love Liberty, to Albion roam;
But, could they bear Oppression,--stay at home.


Then glorious Ancestors would cease to be
Degraded by a worthless Progeny.
None should from noble Blood their Lineage trace,
Unless they added Lustre to their Race.
That the degen'rate Off--spring of the Great
Might be no more a Burden to the State;
The Sons of Peers, with mean, ignoble Hearts,
In Holland should be taught mechanic Arts;
And Boys of Genius to those Honours soar,
Which high--born Dunces but disgrac'd before:
See Nature, thus, the gen'rous Juice divide;
The Spirit rises, and the Dregs subside.

Thus modell'd, we may hope for happier Times;
Our Isle will be rever'd by distant Climes:
And, lest Posterity should think us rude,
And lost, at once, to Shame and Gratitude;
A Patriot Race shall sing the Drapier's Praise,
And civic Crowns fhall mingle with His Bays:
Nor shall His Works alone His Worth proclaim,
(Tho' none, like those, can eternize His Name)
His Statue shall be rais'd in ev'ry Street,
With proud Oppression, writhing at His Feet;
At his Right--hand fair Liberty shall smile,
Protected by the Guardian of our Isle;
With His immortal Labours in her Hand:
Then shall each gen'rous Youth, who passes by,
And sees the Patriot's Image, plac'd on high,
With Emulation feel his Bosom fir'd,
And thus break forth, by Gratitude inspir'd.

O Thou, whose Genius rose, to save the State,
And snatch Thy Country from the Brink of Fate!
When for Thy Life Hibernia sues in vain,
And Heav'n no longer will Thy Crown detain;
Her grateful Sons, already rob'd in White,
Shall hail Thee, glorious, in the Realms of Light. 

Welcome, thou sacred, solemn Guest,
Who com'st to guide me to the Blest.
O Fountain of eternal Truth,
Thou gracious Guardian of my Youth!
True Wisdom to my Soul dispense,
That I may learn thy Will from hence:
Still let me make thy Word my Rule,
And still despise the scorning Fool.
Inspir'd from thence, my Verse shall soar,
Till Time itself shall be no more.
Alas, my Soul! and whar is great,
In Glory of a mortal Date?
Henceforth this vain Ambition spare,
And be Eternity thy Care. 

Since Phoebus makes your Verse divine,
Why should you think, but I, with Ease,
Might write my native, artless Lays?

My Mother told me many a Time,
That Double--dealing was a Crime:
Alas! and is it only so,
In us, whose Birth and Fortune's low?
For you, tho' nobly born, descend
To injure, yet appear a Friend;
And seem to make my Praise your Aim,
With more Success to wound my Fame.


So your Apollo's Priests, of old,
(As by his Poets we are told)
With glorious Wreaths the Victim drest;
Then plung'd the Poniard in his Breast. 


In these sad hours, a prey to ceaseless pain,
While feverish pulses leap in every vein,
When each faint breath the last short effort seems
Of life just parting from my feeble limbs;
How wild soe'er my wandering thoughts may be,
Still, gentle Delia, still they turn on thee!
At length if, slumbering to a short repose,
A sweet oblivion frees me from my woes,
Thy form appears, thy footsteps I pursue,
Through springy vales, and meadows washed in dew;
Thy arm supports me to the fountain's brink,
Where by some secret power forbid to drink,
Gasping with thirst, I view the tempting flood
That flies my touch, or thickens into mud;
Till thine own hand immerged the goblet dips,
And bears it streaming to my burning lips.
There borne aloft on fancy's wing we fly,
Like souls embodied to their native sky;
Now every rock, each mountain, disappears;
And the round earth an even surface wears;
When lo! the force of some resistless weight,
Bears me straight down from that pernicious height;
Parting, in vain our struggling arms we close;
Abhorred forms, dire phantoms interpose;
With trembling voice on thy loved name I call;
And gulfs yawn ready to receive my fall.
From these fallacious visions of distress
I wake; nor are my real sorrows less.
Thy absence, Delia, heightens every ill,
And gives e'en trivial pains the power to kill.
Oh! wert thou near me; yet that wish forbear!
'Twere vain, my love,--'twere vain to wish thee near;
Thy tender heart would heave with anguish too,
And by partaking, but increase my woe.
Alone I'll grieve, till gloomy sorrow past,
Health, like the cheerful day-spring, comes at last,--
Comes fraught with bliss to banish every pain,
Hope, joy, and peace, and Delia in her train


Think, Delia, with what cruel haste
Our fleeting pleasures move,
Nor heedless in sorrow waste
The moments due to love;

Be wise, my fair, and gently treat 
These few that are our friends;
Think thus abused, what sad regret
Their speedy flight attends!

Sure in those eyes I loved so well,
And wished so long to see,
Anger I thought could never dwell,
Or anger aimed at me.

No bold offence of mine I knew
Should e'er provoke your hate;
And, early taught to think you true,
Still hoped a gentler fate.

With kindness bless the present hour,
Or oh! we meet in vain!
What can we do in absence more
Than suffer and complain?

Fated to ills beyond redress,
We must endure our woe;
The days allowed us to possess,
'Tis madness to forego. 


WRITTEN IN BLOOD STAIN INK 

It was another lonely night
While holding on to old tears drops 
of bits of rain, I always feel this pain, 

I can still hear your voice 
dancing into the night of fright, 
sending me kisses of death, 

this doesn't make my night carefree
all it gives is darken dreams, 
I see your ancient eyes looking deep into mine, 
that triers to incense me with words, 

To make traps for me to fall into your fake love, 
In your senses of hateful thinking; 
You tell me to come to you with an open mind, 


To lite a fire deep into your empty heart, 
but I know not to waste no more of my time
On an old ancient rhyme, 

Oh, but how Dark Angels words linger in my mind
Trying hard to play games on my heart, 
Old desires make a big fire, 

He would tell me all kinds of things
Like my heart is his home, 
My soul is all he wants to make is own, 
He would tell me over and over, 
Oh, Moonlight, together we can be alone
And our spirits can run free, 

All we need is each other in a life of a storm, 
We can make love in splendor of lust, 
Oh, how swiftly life passes on by, 

Come Moonlight, take my hands
Let me be your man with deep commands, 
I can see your eyes telling me many things, 

Your heart is graving with mine, 
Come to me and let's make many more dreams
Let's write down in your own blood stain ink
about you and me, you forever king, 

our souls live beyond what others ever known, 
let me touch your silk hands, this is my command, 

Oh, from faraway I can hear the glass break
Where dark dreams are, being made
While souls scream to be set free, 



Come Moonlight, put your candle lite by your window
Let me feel your true delight
even if you're not on my side, 

I am torn by your politeness
It gives me so much madness, 
But with time you will see things my way, 

You know you could never fix me? 
So, stop trying to forgive me, 
 I will always burn in your desire
I will always linger around in your mind, 


I am Dark Angel, your king in all your dreams, 
Your heart will only beat for me; 
Just Waite and you will see, 

Oh, Moonlight, your heart is my home, 
Your mind is my throne, 
Your soul is what I want, 
I will never let you go, 

Together we can make many storms in history, 
We will be written down in the beams 
of the moon stones, together alone.




The sun promised a charming dawn every dusk, 
And went off for a nap in his husk
And lilies never forget to bloom, 
Driving away numerous gloom
I see my hometown, standing proudly
Shielded by the sea and the lake, so lovely
Words deny painting her beauty
Paints are scanty to colour her liveliness
Calmness prevails, peace rules
Striking tiaras, green hues

Breezes fan her, beauty shines
Waters wash her, sunshine dries, 
When I breathe in the salty air, 
I hear the winds chant hymns, everyone care
The sun kisses the sea, the moon’s seen
A synonym of Juno’s mien-
Lying on a glowing bed, an infinite sea 
Stars keep company, an urge to live free

I bike down the road, 
It takes me on its own accord.
The winds tickling my face, the waves coil
I lay down on the shiny black soil
Waves splashing on my feet, sun on my face
Time forgets to keep its pace
Good natured people, with hearts of gold, 
I see them do their afternoon chores

If ever, the big boys in heaven, 
Send a shooting star, across the skies, 
What I’d wish is to
Keep my hometown the way she is
This is where my heart lies



Now fills, O Burns, a space in thine own room, 
Where thou didst dream alone on budded bays, 
Happy and thoughtless of thy day of doom! 
My pulse is warm with thine old barley-bree, 
My head is light with pledging a great soul, 
My eyes are wandering, and I cannot see, 
Fancy is dead and drunken at its goal; 
Yet can I stamp my foot upon thy floor, 
Yet can I ope thy window-sash to find 
The meadow thou hast tramped o'er and o'er,-- 
Yet can I think of thee till thought is blind,-- 
Yet can I gulp a bumper to thy name,-- 
O smile among the shades, for this is fame

This pleasant tale is like a little copse:
The honied lines so freshly interlace,
To keep the reader in so sweet a place,
So that he here and there full-hearted stops;
And oftentimes he feels the dewy drops
Come cool and suddenly against his face,
And, by the wandering melody, may trace
Which way the tender-legged linnet hops.
Oh! what a power has white Simplicity!
What mighty power has this gentle story!
I, that do ever feel athirst for glory,
Could at this moment be content to lie
Meekly upon the grass, as those whose sobbings
Were heard of none beside the mournful robins.

The church bells toll a melancholy round,
Calling the people to some other prayers,
Some other gloominess, more dreadful cares,
More harkening to the sermon's horrid sound.
Surely the mind of man is closely bound
In some blind spell: seeing that each one tears
Himself from fireside joys and Lydian airs,
And converse high of those with glory crowned.
Still, still they toll, and I should feel a damp,
A chill as from a tomb, did I not know
That they are dying like an outburnt lamp, - 
That 'tis their sighing, wailing, ere they go
Into oblivion -that fresh flowers will grow,
And many glories of immortal stamp. 


We tend to reduce things: 
Books to pages, 
Sentences to words, 
Eaons to ages.
 
We tend to change things
Just by observing them: 
Inocense to guilt, 
A song, an anthem. 
 
We tend to simplify; 
Mathematics taught us so: 
Words to numbers, 
Things of nature we don't know. 
 
But You created One and Only Earth: 
She burned and boiled then drowned then froze, 
but Earth: she remained the same.
Are your inventions pun and prose? 
 
For I  am one but not the same
As I was in days before.
Although I may have kept my name; 
The one I was, I am no more. 


What though, for showing truth to flattered state,
Kind Hunt was shut in prison, yet has he,
In his immortal spirit, been as free
As the sky-searching lark, and as elate.
Minion of grandeur! think you he did wait?
Think you he nought but prison-walls did see,
Till, so unwilling, thou unturnedst the key?
Ah, no! far happier, nobler was his fate!
In Spenser's halls he strayed, and bowers fair,
Culling enchanted flowers; and he flew
With daring Milton through the fields of air:
To regions of his own his genius true
Took happy flights. Who shall his fame impair
When thou art dead, and all thy wretched crew


Common sense has taken it's leave - it seems
The brazen have lost all self control. 
Shooting their poison arrows into our face's
With the continuation of an EVIL witches role; 

She is the wicked's messenger of today (spokeswoman)  
Her sadistic - anal retentive mind simply glows
All information is gleaned by the bad and the good. 
As the witch with thread and needle continues to sew; 

It's a vicious circle of criminals -  flocking together
The witches kindergarten art and coded words are seen and heard
Thanks to her, information is gathered daily and recorded
We are forever grateful for her ignorance of the written word; 





Slowly things start to fade from their place
Then disappearing in a steady pace
The writting starts to fade as the pages go black
The writter has to stop and can't go back
Leaving no ending no place to go
There aren't even any pictures to show
No emotion or thought to hear or see
Soon to have nothing left to be
No way to understand or be wrong
no rules saying to be strong
Starting in the same place with the same thought
There's just something there which has you caught
As the time passes on the clock
The writter seems to have writtes block
Sitting there with nothing to say
Time just keeps on going with each passing day


I'm writing sad poems on and on
Listening to the same old songs
Which my friend used to listen when he was broke
But I never realized what he was going through from
Now I understand
Cause I'm going through the same time
Same situation
Pulling up together these lines
But I'm not letting the tears come out of my eyes
Because everybody knows I'm not this type 
But they don't know what she has done to me
I'm turning into a beast
Knowing the fact I'll never hold you again
Like I used to
My head is over crowded
But I can't stop thinking about it
She did wrong
She did wrong to me
Pick up the phone
Talk to me
You did wrong to me


Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night
 Sailed off in a wooden shoe,--
Sailed on a river of crystal light
 Into a sea of dew.
"Where are you going, and what do you wish?"
 The old moon asked the three.
"We have come to fish for the herring-fish
 That live in this beautiful sea;
 Nets of silver and gold have we,"
Said Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.

The old moon laughed and sang a song,
 As they rocked in the wooden shoe;
And the wind that sped them all night long
 Ruffled the waves of dew;
The little stars were the herring-fish
 That lived in the beautiful sea.
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish,--
 Never afraid are we!"
 So cried the stars to the fishermen three,
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.

All night long their nets they threw
 To the stars in the twinkling foam,--
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
 Bringing the fishermen home:
'Twas all so pretty a sail, it seemed
 As if it could not be;
And some folk thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
 Of sailing that beautiful sea;
 But I shall name you the fishermen three:
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod.

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
 And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
 Is a wee one's trundle-bed;
So shut your eyes while Mother sings
 Of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
 As you rock in the misty sea
 Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:--
Wynken,
Blynken,
And Nod. 


Reflecting on my life at the end of the week
A tear leaves my eye and caresses my cheek
My ego wants to force a smile, but my soul doesn’t feel the need
This little sadness doesn’t taste bitter; it is sweet





on some level we all  
are aggregations of cells
like prisons
if life after death exsists
liberated cells celebrate 
the absolute freedom


To D.

He is 
all heart: 
a naked, 
walking, 
talking 
heart now.  
After an accident, 
after a loss, 
his eyes, his mind, 
refused to digest 
the too crude facts; 
sometimes refused
to work; 
But not his heart; 
it even opens more, 
like tulip,  
soak with tears: 
it grows.  

the wavy hard sand 
was massaging my feet
when a startled crab
in the shallow sea
danced away from me
it doubted a while
should I dig in here
or tango some further 
It tangoed quite a bit on
A score of small fishes 
waltzed fast to the deep of the sea
Was is the crab
or were they also afraid of me? 

But the most wonderful dance
was still performed by the waves
white pearls of sweat 
ornamented their foreheads
they made the music
they sculpted the sand
The sand that was wavy
and still was massaging my feet.



this poem is meant for beach lovers
I love the 
Beach beach beach beach beach 
Beach beach beach beach beach

Soooooo Much


Mohammed: fight a holy war
Paradoxical so it seems
Who is wrong and who is right? 

A question that has bothered me
For so long until one day
I saw the movie, Gandi
It solved it straight away

I saw Ghandi fighting 
The strongest of holy wars
While turning his cheek
A fight on the highest possible plane

I read the speech "I have a dream"
Another warrior for justice
Non-violence was his creed
Another holy war while turning cheek

The contradiction is only fake, 
We have to fight injustice
With all the might we can
But on the highest plane.

Fighting a holy war 
While turning cheek
Winning is the only outcome
Indeed a blissful paradox


High over the white clean clouds
she serves hot coffee in the sky
Smiling pretty stewardess 
with one green, one blue eye 
(alluding to her dual life - 
celestial blue and green of grass)        
He saw her left side first, 
an all embracing smile, 
a green, then a blue eye. 
Ah, secret charm of dual life! 
Unearthly pleasure of the flight.
Not far away from Earth, 
a casual face hints at the 
closeness of an unknown space.




There was a time 
when single word of her
was valued more 
than barrel petrol
from the Persian Gulf
by him. 
He calls her
daily chatter now
'cheap talk'
and if we look at 
a game theory, 
it means 'a talk
between the players, which 
does not affect 
the pay-off'. So, guys. 
Back to the Persian Gulf! 



The setting sun
is struggling 
to fight the darkness, 
but is slowly giving in

A magic light red cloud in the sky
shines through crowns of casuarinas
majestically dancing on the rhythm
of the cool evening breeze

The fading red light 
accentuates the silhouettes 
of crisscrossing bats, 
looking for an early dinner



Dear poet, 

I use your poems to feed on my fire, 
to keep burning the desire.


After several years of marriage, 
despite the feeling still alive is: 
the Eden's apple on the table; 
the Bible's snake - now common servant, 
to serve me sex-appeal`s apples.

Love poems, used like candles, 
or coals for more fire
of what is becoming a daily routine 
of connubial lust and desire.


Excuse me, if i did misuse, 
Your poems come
without instructions, 
can be misinterpreted or
misused so. 

Crystal clear way ahead
With definite direction 
Pointed to the east
Navigated by the stars.

Filled with Loaf and wine
started your journey 
carrying jewels and diamonds

Eyes are closed
and cries aloud 
I lost my way
To reach my home.


Papa calls and sing a song
All the way with smell of camphor
Find the way to reach my home
A new horizon we met again. 

Whatever on your page
whenever I just read
there surely find a sage
who has a moral creed

I decode your message
and leave there my note
comprising my homage
if you wish to connote

a good deed's to be praised
if someone reads you once
he simply stays amazed
at boldness and brilliance


Near a hotel pool, close to the sea
Stands proudly, this huge umbrella tree
Its thick branches, far and widely spread
Blooming with flowers, small and softly red
on top of a wealthy green leafy bed

A breeze from the ever blue sea gushes by
Making hundreds of flowers fly high
And beauties that once ornamented the tree, 
In a snow-flaky fashion, a pleasure to see, 
Fall down in the pool, fall down on me

Looking at the flowers in the pool, I note
They seem to enjoy to be lightly afloat
But then it occurs to me, a jolt in my head: 
They do not enjoy, they’re dead
They have become floppy, hopelessly wet

My mind fills with thoughts of my own mortality
How long will my body, my mind still be? 
But my body and mind are not what makes up me.
I am my soul, which after death will be free
I think it may still come back to see
This miraculously beautiful umbrella tree.

But a man grabbed it as I reached for it and that made me mad.
I tripped him with my foot and he fell to the floor.
I grabbed the XBOX and ran out of the store.
But I forgot to pay for it and I went to jail.
When my son didn't get his XBOX  he raised hell.
While I was behind bars, it was hard for me to cope.
But things got worse one day when I dropped my soap. 

Xerox machine does as per the eyes in vision, 
It goes on working for people every season.
The exact photography of the things appear, 
One after another, in closing it does disappear.



A invented xerography, 
In it became available in market with comfy.
Xerography comes from the Greek for dry writing, 
Xerox Corporation supplies this machine in full fitting.

Invention of Xerox machine brings vainglory to men, 
It provides copies to many people standing in den.
Pictures of different creatures, flowers and things, 
Same size and exact appearance machine does bring.

It is very useful and unavoidable now days, 
People use in office, in school and in college.
It needs not purchase a book to read a page, 
Xerography is in use from tiny age to old age.

Some people use it as their source of earning, 
This is an ultra modern technique in learning.
Scientists invent many things for people's welfare, 
But Nature is such that we are bound to care. 


The night
engulfed us all
in its deepest
and darkest secrets.
One house.
Six people.
It was all that mattered to us.
As uncontrollable 
cries of laughter
filled our souls
with warmth, 
we felt
as though we entered
a whole new realm.

Our eyes met, 
and we knew from then, 
that things would never be the same.

But what do we do
when, in one moment, 
one shared glance, 
our 'reality' dissolved 
in our vibrant attraction? 

We immersed ourselves
in each other, 
electrified our senses, 
and became unquestionably oblivious
about anything else. 


A MATCHLESS COURTESY.

Felice spirto.

Blest spirit, who with loving tenderness
Quickenest my heart so old and near to die,
Who mid thy joys on me dost bend an eye
Though many nobler men around thee press!
As thou wert erewhile wont my sight to bless,
So to console my mind thou now dost fly;
Hope therefore stills the pangs of memory,
Which coupled with desire my soul distress.
So finding in thee grace to plead for me-
Thy thoughts for me sunk in so sad a case-
He who now writes, returns thee thanks for these.
Lo, it were foul and monstrous usury
To send thee ugliest paintings in the place
Of thy fair spirit's living phantasies. 


BRAZEN GIFTS FOR GOLDEN.

Per esser manco almen.

Seeking at least to be not all unfit
For thy sublime and boundless courtesy,
My lowly thoughts at first were fain to try
What they could yield for grace so infinite.
But now I know my unassisted wit
Is all too weak to make me soar so high;
For pardon, lady, for this fault I cry,
And wiser still I grow remembering it.
Yea, well I see what folly 'twere to think
That largess dropped from thee like dews from heaven
Could e'er be paid by work so frail as mine!
To nothingness my art and talent sink;
He fails who from his mortal stores hath given
A thousandfold to match one gift divine. 



THE MODEL AND THE STATUE.

Da che concetto.

When divine Art conceives a form and face,
She bids the craftsman for his first essay
To shape a simple model in mere clay:
This is the earliest birth of Art's embrace.
From the live marble in the second place
His mallet brings into the light of day
A thing so beautiful that who can say
When time shall conquer that immortal grace?
Thus my own model I was born to be-
The model of that nobler self, whereto
Schooled by your pity, lady, I shall grow.
Each overplus and each deficiency
You will make good. What penance then is due
For my fierce heat, chastened and taught by you




THE MODEL AND THE STATUE.



When that which is divine in us doth try
To shape a face, both brain and hand unite
To give, from a mere model frail and slight,
Life to the stone by Art's free energy.
Thus too before the painter dares to ply
Paint-brush or canvas, he is wont to write
Sketches on scraps of paper, and invite
Wise minds to judge his figured history.
So, born a model rude and mean to be
Of my poor self, I gain a nobler birth,
Lady, from you, you fountain of all worth!
Each overplus and each deficiency
You will make good. What penance then is due
For my fierce heat, chastened and taught by you



Far more than I was wont myself I prize:
With you within my heart I rise in rate,
Just as a gem engraved with delicate
Devices o'er the uncut stone doth rise;
Or as a painted sheet exceeds in price
Each leaf left pure and in its virgin state:
Such then am I since I was consecrate
To be the mark for arrows from your eyes.
Stamped with your seal I'm safe where'er I go,
Like one who carries charms or coat of mail
Against all dangers that his life assail
Nor fire nor water now may work me woe;
Sight to the blind I can restore by you,
Heal every wound, and every loss renew. 


O thou that from thy mansion
  Through time and place to roam,
Dost send abroad thy children,
  And then dost call them home,

That men and tribes and nations
  And all thy hand hath made
May shelter them from sunshine
  In thine eternal shade:

We now to peace and darkness
  And earth and thee restore
Thy creature that thou madest
  And wilt cast forth no more. 

Xmas comes once in every year, 
It brings happiness and gladness tear.
December twenty-fifth is a holy-day, 
Also it is for the student a holiday.

This day is celebrated as Noel, 
Who redeems us from the hell? 

They decorate the church with fragrant flowers, 
Colourful light does bedazzle the light-showers.

Fanatical Children make exquisite garlands, 
Which beautify the splendour of Holy Land? 
They also decorate with holly the holy of the holies, 
Candles light hall and make the gloom release.


They play on drum, trumpet with joy, 
All together dance, sing without coy.
Different food stalls are set near holy land, 
They get contentment by eating hand in hand.

Some fancy shops are opened near festive ground, 
People purchase faience and some toys in bound.
Xmas indeed brings compunction and compassion, 
It makes consciousness in brotherhood and impulsion.


'Tis five years since, `An end,' said I;
`I'll march no further, time to die.
All's lost; no worse has heaven to give.'
Worse has it given, and yet I live.

I shall not die to-day, no fear:
I shall live yet for many a year,
And see worse ills and worse again,
And die of age and not of pain.

The blue height of the hollow roof,
He sought him pillars sure and strong,
And ere he found them sought them long.

The stark steel splintered from the thrust,
The basalt mountain sprang to dust,
The blazing pier of diamond flawed
In shards of rainbow all abroad.

What found he, that the heavens stand fast?
What pillar proven firm at last
Bears up so light that world-seen span?
The heart of man, the heart of man. 


How clear, how lovely bright,
How beautiful to sight
  Those beams of morning play;
How heaven laughs out with glee
Where, like a bird set free,
Up from the eastern sea
  Soars the delightful day.

To-day I shall be strong,
No more shall yield to wrong,
  Shall squander life no more;
Days lost, I know not how,
I shall retrieve them now;
Now I shall keep the vow
  I never kept before.

Ensanguining the skies
How heavily it dies
  Into the west away;
Past touch and sight and sound
Not further to be found,
How hopeless under ground
  Falls the remorseful day. 


As pen and ink alike serve him who sings
In high or low or intermediate style;
As the same stone hath shapes both rich and vile
To match the fancies that each master brings;
So, my loved lord, within thy bosom springs
Pride mixed with meekness and kind thoughts that smile:
Whence I draw nought, my sad self to beguile,
But what my face shows-dark imaginings.
He who for seed sows sorrow, tears, and sighs,

(The dews that fall from heaven, though pure and clear,
From different germs take divers qualities)
Must needs reap grief and garner weeping eyes;
And he who looks on beauty with sad cheer,
Gains doubtful hope and certain miseries. 


Star and coronal and bell
  April underfoot renews,
And the hope of man as well
  Flowers among the morning dews.

Now the old come out to look,
  Winter past and winter's pains,
How the sky in pool and brook
  Glitters on the grassy plains.

Easily the gentle air
  Wafts the turning season on;
Things to comfort them are there,
  Though 'tis true the best are gone.

Now the scorned unlucky lad
  Rousing from his pillow gnawn
Mans his heart and deep and glad
  Drinks the valiant air of dawn.

Half the night he longed to die,
  Now are sown on hill and plain
Pleasures worth his while to try
  Ere he longs to die again.

Blue the sky from east to west
  Arches, and the world is wide,
Though the girl he loves the best
  Rouses from another's side. 

The Wain upon the northern steep
  Descends and lifts away.
Oh I will sit me down and weep
  For bones in Africa.

For pay and medals, name and rank,
  Things that he has not found,
He hove the Cross to heaven and sank
  The pole-star underground.

And now he does not even see
  Signs of the nadir roll
At night over the ground where he
  Is buried with the pole. 


I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.
I love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
in secret, between the shadow and the soul.

I love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.

I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;
so I love you because I know no other way

than this: where I does not exist, nor you,
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.




How can that be, lady, which all men learn
By long experience? Shapes that seem alive,
Wrought in hard mountain marble, will survive
Their maker, whom the years to dust return!
Thus to effect cause yields. Art hath her turn,
And triumphs over Nature. I, who strive
With Sculpture, know this well; her wonders live
In spite of time and death, those tyrants stern.
So I can give long life to both of us
In either way, by colour or by stone,
Making the semblance of thy face and mine.
Centuries hence when both are buried, thus
Thy beauty and my sadness shall be shown,
And men shall say, 'For her 'twas wise to pine.


'Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?
And what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists?
And wherefore is he wearing such a conscience-stricken air?
Oh they're taking him to prison for the colour of his hair.

'Tis a shame to human nature, such a head of hair as his;
In the good old time 'twas hanging for the colour that it is;
Though hanging isn't bad enough and flaying would be fair
For the nameless and abominable colour of his hair.

Oh a deal of pains he's taken and a pretty price he's paid
To hide his poll or dye it of a mentionable shade;
But they've pulled the beggar's hat off for the world to see and stare,
And they're haling him to justice for the colour of his hair.

Now 'tis oakum for his fingers and the treadmill for his feet
And the quarry-gang on Portland in the cold and in the heat,
And between his spells of labour in the time he has to spare



A heart of flaming sulphur, flesh of tow,
Bones of dry wood, a soul without a guide
To curb the fiery will, the ruffling pride
Of fierce desires that from the passions flow;
A sightless mind that weak and lame doth go
Mid snares and pitfalls scattered far and wide;-
What wonder if the first chance brand applied
To fuel massed like this should make it glow?
Add beauteous art, which, brought with us from heaven,
Will conquer nature;-so divine a power
Belongs to him who strives with every nerve.
If I was made for art, from childhood given
A prey for burning beauty to devour,
I blame the mistress I was born to serve. 


The rain, it streams on stone and hillock,
  The boot clings to the clay.
Since all is done that's due and right
Let's home; and now, my lad, good-night,
  For I must turn away.

Good-night, my lad, for nought's eternal;
  No league of ours, for sure.
To-morrow I shall miss you less,
And ache of heart and heaviness
  Are things that time should cure.

Over the hill the highway marches
  And what's beyond is wide:
Oh soon enough will pine to nought
Remembrance and the faithful thought
  That sits the grave beside.

The skies, they are not always raining
  Nor grey the twelvemonth through;
And I shall meet good days and mirth,
And range the lovely lands of earth
  With friends no worse than you.

But oh, my man, the house is fallen
  That none can build again;
My man, how full of joy and woe
Your mother bore you years ago
  To-night to lie in the rain. 


One day is beautiful
The next one is dull
Like a dark summer's night
Following a summer so bright

I had what many call Paradise
I wasn't very wise to walk away twice
What am I, a mistress, a wife? 
Why do I always have to lead half a life? 

Well, a slice of the cake is better than none
My life would be over if you were gone
Half a heart's better than half a life
But I guess half a life's better than nothing


What joy hath yon glad wreath of flowers that is
Around her golden hair so deftly twined,
Each blossom pressing forward from behind,
As though to be the first her brows to kiss!
The livelong day her dress hath perfect bliss,
That now reveals her breast, now seems to bind:
And that fair woven net of gold refined
Rests on her cheek and throat in happiness!
Yet still more blissful seems to me the band
Gilt at the tips, so sweetly doth it ring
And clasp the bosom that it serves to lace:
Yea, and the belt to such as understand,
Bound round her waist, saith: here I'd ever cling.-
What would my arms do in that girdle's place


The night is freezing fast,
  To-morrow comes December;
    And winterfalls of old
Are with me from the past;
  And chiefly I remember
    How Dick would hate the cold.

Fall, winter, fall; for he,
  Prompt hand and headpiece clever,
    Has woven a winter robe,
And made of earth and sea
  His overcoat for ever,
    And wears the turning globe. 



Kind to the world, but to itself unkind,
A worm is born, that dying noiselessly
Despoils itself to clothe fair limbs, and be
In its true worth by death alone divined.
Oh, would that I might die, for her to find
Raiment in my outworn mortality!
That, changing like the snake, I might be free
To cast the slough wherein I dwell confined!
Nay, were it mine, that shaggy fleece that stays,
Woven and wrought into a vestment fair,
Around her beauteous bosom in such bliss!
All through the day she'd clasp me! Would I were
The shoes that bear her burden! When the ways
Were wet with rain, her feet I then should kiss


The world goes none the lamer
  For ought that I can see,
Because this cursed trouble
  Has struck my days and me.

The stars of heaven are steady,
  The founded hills remain,
Though I to earth and darkness
  Return in blood and pain.

Farewell to all belongings
  I won or bought or stole;
Farewell, my lusty carcase,
  Farewell, my aery soul.

Oh worse remains for others
  And worse to fear had I
Than here at four-and-twenty
  To lay me down and die. 



If through the eyes the heart speaks clear and true,
I have no stronger sureties than these eyes
For my pure love. Prithee let them suffice,
More tenderly perchance than is my due,
Your spirit sees into my heart, where rise
The flames of holy worship, nor denies
The grace reserved for those who humbly sue.
Oh, blessed day when you at last are mine!
Let time stand still, and let noon's chariot stay;
Fixed be that moment on the dial of heaven!
That I may clasp and keep, by grace divine,
Clasp in these yearning arms and keep for aye
My heart's loved lord to me desertless given


They call me crybaby
'cause I cry all the time
Can't hold back my tears
When I'm not feeling fine

Give me my milk
I'm raising my voice
Don't you wanna play
With me and my toys? 

I hurt my head
Won't you come running? 
I'll scream even louder
When I don't hear you coming

Gently caress me
And hold my hand
Won't you follow me
Into playland? 

Do what I want
Or my doll's gonna die
You don't want to make
Your babygirl cry


LOVE THE LIGHT-GIVER.



With your fair eyes a charming light I see,
For which my own blind eyes would peer in vain;
Stayed by your feet the burden I sustain
Which my lame feet find all too strong for me;
Wingless upon your pinions forth I fly;
Heavenward your spirit stirreth me to strain;
E'en as you will, I blush and blanch again,
Freeze in the sun, burn 'neath a frosty sky.
Your will includes and is the lord of mine;
Life to my thoughts within your heart is given;
My words begin to breathe upon your breath:
Like to the moon am I, that cannot shine
Alone; for lo! our eyes see nought in heaven
Save what the living sun illumineth. 

Love feeds, like Intellect, his lamp with truth;
In the clear truths he finds its flame is measured.
And is not flesh, there, verity? In sooth!
So Love not by this fantasy is pleasured
That slurs the fact in flesh. Its atmosphere,
Too rare and nebulous, no fusing shows;
Its manna too ambrosial is and sheer:
Love craves that union, earthly hunger knows.
O sage is Love—he seeks the living line,
The miracles in breathing flesh explores,
The riches in the depth of sense, divine,
The veiled things only eternal longing pours
Light unobscured on—yes, his doubting done,
With flesh the imminent two converts to one.


'Tis time, I think, by Wenlock town 
The golden broom should blow; 
The hawthorn sprinkled up and down 
Should charge the land with snow. 

Spring will not wait the loiterer's time 
Who keeps so long away; 
So others wear the broom and climb 
The hedgerows heaped with may. 

Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge, 
Gold that I never see; 
Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge 
That will not shower on me. 


When first my way to fair I took
  Few pence in purse had I,
And long I used to stand and look
  At things I could not buy.

Now times are altered: if I care
  To buy a thing, I can;
The pence are here and here's the fair,
  But where's the lost young man?

- - To think that two and two are four
  And neither five nor three
The heart of man has long been sore
  And long 'tis like to be. 


West and away the wheels of darkness roll,
  Day's beamy banner up the east is borne,
Spectres and fears, the nightmare and her foal,
  Drown in the golden deluge of the morn.

But over sea and continent from sight
  Safe to the Indies has the earth conveyed
The vast and moon-eclipsing cone of night,
  Her towering foolscap of eternal shade.

See, in mid heaven the sun is mounted; hark,
  The belfries tingle to the noonday chime.
'Tis silent, and the subterranean dark
  Has crossed the nadir, and begins to climb. 




O never an oathe sweares he,
And never a pig-taile jerkes;
With a brick-batte he ne lurkes
For to buste y'e crust, perdie,
Of y'e man from over sea,
A-synging as he werkes.
For he knows ful well, y's youth,
A tricke of exceeding worth:
And he plans withouten ruth
A conflagration's birth


Food for the body

I know of men, who do not have enough, 
Lacking food and drink, their life is rough
Day in, day out they struggle for food
There is no time for any other good


Food for the ego

I know of men who have enough food and drink
So they have time for something else to think
Their egos are hungry for money, power and fame
Getting more, being restless, an endless game


Food for the soul

I know of men who are contented with how they live
They focus on soul and never cease to give
To give love and support, perform acts randomly kind 
They are the ones who have at any time peace of mind


Become a garbage man
Every day, just for a minute
Search for some litter
Pick up some garbage 
Where ever you can

Don't stoop down.
Not good for the back
Just sit on your heels
Stay squatted and look up
It gives you a special perspective

Pick up a hand full
Walk to the bin
Not the nearest 
The walking is exercise
Good for your body

So, become a garbage man
It can give you perspective
It is good for your body
It is good for the world
Just a hand full per day.



It is dark, no moon, no light 
Just darkness, a starless sky
The wind blows, the waves break
A single firefly passes by

Soon the firefly is gone
Leaving me in the darkest of nights
The tiny fly made me anticipate
A sunrise with the finest of lights



Up high, 
Up high in the vast sky
I searched for ultimate beauty
Ultimate beauty was what I yearned to see
But then just inches above the horizon
Right in front of my wide open eyes
I found the most amazing
The most picturesque 
Of all clouds
Luxurious soft pastels
Of light purple and 
Mellow orange
Almost caressing the sea

The morning sun shone.
The sweet warmth of the rays
magnified their exquisite beauty
and the sky's lovely tenderness
was dancing in the soft light.


I inhaled the beauty
and it went straight to my heart

I tasted the tenderness
and it went straight to my heart

I absorbed the warmth
and it went straight to my heart


A tiny hand of a baby
Reaching for the love of his mom
Touching the nurse's heart

No one can imagine the size
Of the flow of love
From nurse to child


An eagle glides through the skies
Perfectly beautiful and full of grace

A wonderful fish swims through clear waters
Perfectly beautiful and full of grace

Then it happens: The eagle meets the fish
The eagle still glides, the fish no longer


The morning sunlight
In all its glory
The morning sunlight 
In all its glam

Every molecule in my heart
Is jumping up and down
The quarks inside collide
Emanating a mini beam of light

I hope that this little beam of light
Coming from my heart in a way
Can just like the morning sun
Brighten the lives of those I meet today

Sitting at the river bed
Please help me, show the way
Show me the light of day

Then in front of me
a small boat passed 
a man was rowing

I suddenly realised
But I had to row


I went to the sea of love, this noon
I took it and put it in a blue balloon

I brought this balloon, so blue
all the way, especially for you

So, quick, quick, quick
Give this balloon a prick

a sea of love, to never end

I breathe in 
I breathe in a big breath
A big breath of clean air
A big breath of pure energy
A breath of power

I take a breath
A deep breath of healing
A deep breath of love
A deep breath of wisdom
A breath full of spirit

I breathe the sea breeze
Bringing freshness
I breathe in stormy winds
I inhale their creativity
I inhale their strength

Oxygen is flowing in
entering my lungs, 
Permeating my being
And I breathe in once more
A big deep breath. 


Tonight, 
I saw the nightly light
Creating a glorious sight
On a field of grass

Then i suddenly realised
That all day long 
I had been blinded

Only now at night
I saw the glorious sight
Of nightly light
On the grass

I had not seen any glory
The whole day long
something must 've blinded me

Blinded by sunlight? 
Or blinded by buzz? 
By clutter and buzz
Of a busy day

Blinded by the rush
By a bout of anger
By things that matter little
I had missed the glory of the day

I had missed the glory
Of all the trees i'd passed
The glory of the grass
Of sea and skies

I had missed the glory
Of all the friendship
Of all the love and kindness
Of everyone i'd met

I must have been blind
Blind to all this glory
Blind to all this grace

Unblind me
So tomorrow i will see
The world in all its glory

The glory of the skies and sea
Of the grass and trees
Of everyone around me
Please god help me see

We are having a yard sale today.
Hold the door open for me, Mother says
As she carries a box out onto the driveway
And the cats scramble out for fresh air
While Father paces out back, scratching his head
And my brothers sit inside, sipping Pepsis
I follow Mother out into the cold
And ask her if she needs help

She smiles and says, Oh Jamie
You were always the one who wanted to help
Then sets the box down before me and asks
Could you make sure we got everything? 
Before she runs inside to yell at Father
There are grey clouds in the sky
And I too, am a darker shade of grey
As I begin to sift through my childhood. 

The soccer ball my brothers and I lost 
Religiously, once, twice, thrice a week
Over the backyard fence and into
The neighbor's yard, where the dog awaits
I ring on Mr. Ryan's doorbell in shame
Like I've just murdered the President
And Puppy covers me with slobber
My corporal punishment, I guess

The old phones we used before the new ones
White and bulky, trailing tangly cables
That I curled around my finger as I
Listened to my grandfather speak to me
Across thousands of miles of water
You don't have to reply, Father says
He can't hear you, his ears are bad
But I yell into the receiver anyway

The vocabulary book Mother made me study
In preparation for standardized testing
For so many hours I could swear I had lost
A part of my soul, memorizing diaphonous
Until it literally lost all its meaning
So I take revenge on her by using big words
She doesn't understand, like fastidious
Mother, why must you be so fastidious? 

The cap and gown I wore five years ago
On graduation day, when it rained
Even though Father said it wouldn't
So all his pictures came out bad
And as the sky fell upon our field
We threw our mortarboards up in defiance
Announcing our presence in this world
And at the same time, our weight. 

It is starting to rain now.
Hurry Jamie, Mother yells
Bring the box back inside
She holds the door open for me
And I run through as fast as I can
To find that Father is singing
And my brothers are laughing
And Mother is smiling

Some things are not for sale(    

I did an unending penance
To appease the heartless gods
'cause that was all I could, 
When I looked at my innocent
Little daughter Devayani.
The merciless gods called back 
Her mother, when she was borne.

.  . . I became both mother and father to her.

        (    

I denounced death. So
I secured Mrutasanjeevani, 
The mantra that could give 
Life back to the dead.
If only I could secure it
Before my wife left me! 

        (    

I was anointed Aacharya
As my mantra became handy for them, 
For asuras were at war with suras
And repeatedly defeated.

Now suras were retreating
Defeated, dwindling in number, 
While asuras continued to live
Even after death.

.  . .. I was the most revered in all the fourteen worlds.

        (    

Devayani had grown up 
Into a lovely damsel of fourteen
And played with the princess.

        (    

Then came Kacha, 
Son of Brihaspati
The Aacharya of Suras, 
To be my disciple
Learn the Vedas and Vidya, 
And I refused none, who's worthy.

Kacha proved worthy
A very keen disciple-
Worthiest of all, gobbled all
I had to offer. In no time.

I loved him. Devayani loved him-
I could see it in her eyes.
But his eyes revealed nothing
Even when he played with Devayani.

        (    

Then the king asked me 
To expel him, for he has come
To cheat us of Mritasanjeevani.
I didn't bide, I never refused Vidya.

So, they killed, minced the body 
To pieces and fed to wolves.
I could not bear to see
My little one in tears! 
The power of Mrutasanjeevani
Brought him back to life! 

.  . .. Asuras were furious.

They killed him again 'n' again
And I gave him life back every time.
They played every trick on me.
Finally, Kacha's body was burned
And the ashes served to me with wine.
A vice pays back with a catastrophe.

When I chanted the mantra
And called him to life, 
giving in to Devayani's tears, 
He responded from my stomach.

Again, on Devayani's pleas
Advised him Mrutasanjeevani
While still inside me. 

He had
To take my life to come out


 And gave it back gratefully.

        (    

I had lost the mantra for ever.
Fell from grace. Denounced by asuras.
But all was for my Devayani.

        (    

But Kacha left us without a trace
A sorrowing Devayani broke my heart.
When Suras attacked again, 
Defeat was ours, sans mantra.
Everybody blamed me
Called me deceiver, spy of suras.

I could take all the blame
For my Little One. And she
clung to me, understandingly.

Apart from Kacha's disappearance, 
The vibes of her friends 
Tortured her more. 

Always in tears.

.  .   My heart sank with her.

        (    

I was exultant, when Emperor Yayati
Took her hand, after he rescued her
From the ditch, where the princess
Had pushed her in. All was well.

No! Devayani wanted the princess
As her maid. And fearing my wrath
The king agreed with tears, nay, blood
Pouring from his eyes. For His Daughter.
I knew, this was not for good. 

Be humble
In your success was what I taught.


. 

But I never said NO to my L'l One.


        (    

Now I am here, in the palace
Of Hastinapura. Devayani is
In tears Again. Her hunband had
Cheated her to father children
With Princess Sharmishta.

She wanted revenge. And revenge it was.
My curse turned the emperor old. 
A thousand years old! 
His hair gray and skin scaly.

His tears, again melted my heart, again.
Yielded: You can get back your youth
If anybody gives it to you willingly
And accepts your wrinkles.( 

Finally, I had my revenge! 

Mother of Puru, King Emperor
The youngest emperor ever
Adorned the throne of Hastinapura.

        ( 

I was borne the princess 
Daughter of the asura king.
Life was a bed of roses
Until we attacked devas
Father wanting to conquer
All the fourteen worlds.

Defeat did not deter him
Attacked again; repelled again.

Hope returned with Aacharya
Who had with him daughter Devayani
And mantra Mrutasanjeevani
That gave life back to the dead.

        ( 

Father bowed before Aacharya
And I, before the proud Devayani.
Why name her Devayani? 
She wanted to be called Deva
I refused, for Devas were
Our sworn enemies.
When we played, she always

.  . . 

But, said father, I could not weep
.  . . 

For princesses keep their nose up.

        ( 

We started winning the wars
With Aacharaya and his mantra
Awaited the final kill
So father crowns himself
The King of Devalok. First step
To the crown of the universe.

        ( 

Then came Kacha, the handsome
Son of the aacharya of Devas
And enrolled with Aacharya.
He made friends with Devayani
And she needed me no longer; 
They were in love! 

Rumours had it that Kacha came
To steal Mrutasanjeevani.
Father wanted him ousted; 
Refused, he had him killed
But Aacharya gave him life
Back, again and again.

Finally his ashes were fed
To Aacharya with wine.
So he was advised the mantra
So, both could live.
And, the mantra in his bag
Kacha left us for good.

        ( 

Devayani grieving for his lover
Fell from grace, subdued.
My pleasure knew no bounds.


Next battle we fought sans mantra
We were defeated. Dreams shattered.
Everybody grieved with father.

        ( 

One weak moment, overwhelmed by anger
I pushed Devayani into a ditch and fled.
When I was called to her presence
Emperor Yayati had her hands in his
And she ordered me to go with her
As her maid. I cried in vain.

        ( 

Yayati's palace in Hastinapura, 
I had noticed lust in his eyes
Whenever I crossed his path.
His longing eyes followed me
Everywhere. I had my vengeance
When I had him in my quarters.

I concealed Puru from Devayani
Until he was fourteen, when her
Probing eyes found his truth.
My son, grandson of Asura King
Son of King Emperor. 

But destined
To be borne in a dasi's quarters.

. 


I wanted him the next King Emperor
. 


In vain, I knew. Still. 

        ( 

Irate, Aacharya cursed the emperor
To be a thousand years old. 

Devoid 
of his youth, right before my eyes.
Aacharya yielded finally to his
beseeches: he could trade his wrinkles
For youth, with anybody willing.

Eerie silence followed.
Barely able to stand erect
The emperor looked longingly
At every young face in the court.
Before he could wink his eyes
Everybody fled. Left alone
In the court, he quivered 
And Devayani laughed aloud.

        ( 

Into the deadly silence
Entered Yadu, the first born, 
The Crown Prince, Son of Devayani.
Said Yayati, 'Give me your youth
And the throne is yours'. 
Taken aback, the youth said
'I want to enjoy my life; 
The throne is anyway mine.'

'No, it's mine. It is his
Who gives me his youth and accepts
my wrinkles', Cried the emperor.

        ( 

Puru lead me into this melee.
Before his failing eyes could 
Recognize us, emperor heard
'Father, my youth is yours
And I don't want the throne.'
There stood the emperor
In all his youth; my fourteen 
Year-old child gray and wrinkled.

. 


I felt proud of my son! 

Yayati relinquished the throne
And made him accept it. 

. 


Suddenly it dawned on me, 
. 



I had the last laugh, 
Or did I? 

        ( 

Still, whenever I set my eyes
On my little son, 
Just fourteen years old, 
Now as old as the seas, my heart
Broke. An ocean of tears
Welled up in my mind.

And I have to run the empire
For my son was a novice.


        ( 

Still, 
When I was alone in my anthapura
I wept my heart out, for my son.
Yayati's searching hands on me, 
That I wanted all over my body
still youthful, made me now quiver
in disgust. For my heart filled 
With the images of my son gray to his 
Eye-lids; wrinkled as Aashadh skies.

It broke my heart to see him
Shunned by the sweet little damsels
His erstwhile playmates.

.  . . 

Still, I should not weep
.  . . 


Finally, I had my revenge! 

Mother of Puru, King Emperor

When I look back from here
I realise, I have erred.

Not in refusing the throne; 
But declining to relinquish
My youth for my father.

Otherwise! 

        ( 

The throne was never mine.
I was old enough to decipher
The murmurs that lingered in
The corridors of the palace
Linking my name with that of 
Kacha, the son of Brihaspati.

I am sure father knew the fact
But was gracious enough, not to
mention even to mother. He loved
Me more than even his sons.
Whatever I have is his; nothing
Mine. His was everything.

        ( 

And Puru gave up everything
In return for nothing; 
Proved the legitimate son.
Exchanged his youth for
the wrinkles father bore.
And refused the throne.

This moment he was young
Just turning fourteen
The next, old as the skies
Almost unable to stand erect.

Father nearly fell on his feet
To make him accept the empire.

And without hesitation, 
He shared it with me. 
So I became king too. 

        ( 

Prophets said 'you would 
The favour to Puru return
Generations later, when
A noble descendant of yours
Will save from disaster
His progeny, the Puruvamsham.'


I wish it comes true, so
I can pay back at least
A fraction of my debt
Not just to Puru, but father too.(

The Legacy
Of Yayati lingers on.

        ( 

Santhanu, his descendant, had 
Ganga of divine birth, as his wife
To them was born Devavrata
Who grew up as a handsome prince.

When Ganga left him, 
Santhanu fell for Satyavati
A girl born to a fisherman
Already mother of Vyasa
By sage Parasara, and denied
Devavrata his rightful throne.

Such is lust.

        ( 

Chitrangada born to Satyavati
Died young, fighting for vanity.
His brother married two damsels
Died of consumption, young
leaving no issues, but young widows
who bore children by Vyasa, 
Pandu was born frail and weak
Dhritarashtra, the elder, blind.

Dhritarashtra fathered sons
A hundred. Pandu died young.
His wives had sons-the Pandavas-
Born to men they chose.
Pandavas staked claim on the crown
Rightfully of their cousins.


        ( 

Fierce war ensued.

The entire world divided in two
Took sides and fought one another
All Dhritarashtrans were killed
And the Pandavas won the war
Only women and children remained
And the elderly Pandavas.

Such is the outcome of lust.(

Ye flags of Piccadilly, 
Where I posted up and down, 
And wished myself so often 
Well away from you and town--

Are the people walking quietly 
And steady on their feet, 
Cabs and omnibuses plying 
Just as usual in the street?

Do the houses look as upright 
As of old they used to be, 
And does nothing seem affected 
By the pitching of the sea?

Through the Green Park iron railings 
Do the quick pedestrians pass? 
Are the little children playing 
Round the plane-tree in the grass?

This squally wild northwester 
With which our vessel fights, 
Does it merely serve with you to 
Carry up some paper kites?

Ye flags of Piccadilly, 
Which I hated so, I vow 
I could wish with all my heart 
You were underneath me now


Yea, thou shalt die,
And lie
Dumb in the silent tomb;
Nor to thy name
Shall there be any fame
In ages yet to be or years to come:
For of the flowering Rose,
Which on Pieria blows,
Thou hast no share:
But in sad Hades' house,
Unknown, inglorious,
'Mid the dim shades that wander there
Shalt thou flit forth and haunt the filmy air. 


It's already been a full year since our first date.
We've been through it all; 
We survived with both love & hate.

We had days when nothing could stand in our way, 
We had days that we wish could go away.
We talked for hours about everything on the phone, 
We ignored each others calls when we wanted to be left alone.

At times we've given this relationship our all, 
At times we just let it slip & watch it fall.
Wee've had talks that were so romantic, 
We got into fights that started with an argument.

Our relationship goes beyond night and day, & heaven and hell.
Everyday is different; It started out innocent but eventually fell.
We sometimes would break up with one another, 
But in the end we both knew we were meant for each other.

There is no word to describe us.
It could be delicate or rough, 
But the best way to describe you & me, 
Is crazy in love. 


YEAR of meteors! brooding year!
   I would bind in words retrospective, some of your deeds and signs;
   I would sing your contest for the h Presidentiad;
   I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair, mounted the
         scaffold in Virginia;
   (I was at hand--silent I stood, with teeth shut close--I watch'd;
   I stood very near you, old man, when cool and indifferent, but
         trembling with age and your unheal'd wounds, you mounted the
         scaffold;)
   --I would sing in my copious song your census returns of The States,
   The tables of population and products--I would sing of your ships and
         their cargoes,
   The proud black ships of Manhattan, arriving, some fill'd with
         immigrants, some from the isthmus with cargoes of gold;
   Songs thereof would I sing--to all that hitherward comes would I
         welcome give;                                                And you would I sing, fair stripling! welcome to you from me, sweet
         boy of England!
   Remember you surging Manhattan's crowds, as you pass'd with your
         cortege of nobles?
   There in the crowds stood I, and singled you out with attachment;
   I know not why, but I loved you.  (and so go forth little song,
   Far over sea speed like an arrow, carrying my love all folded,
   And find in his palace the youth I love, and drop these lines at his
         feet;)
   --Nor forget I to sing of the wonder, the ship as she swam up my bay,
   Well-shaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my bay, she was feet long,
   Her, moving swiftly, surrounded by myriads of small craft, I forget
         not to sing;
   --Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the north, flaring in
         heaven;                                                      Nor the strange huge meteor procession, dazzling and clear, shooting
         over our heads,
   (A moment, a moment long, it sail'd its balls of unearthly light over
         our heads,
   Then departed, dropt in the night, and was gone;)
   --Of such, and fitful as they, I sing--with gleams from them would I
         gleam and patch these chants;
   Your chants, O year all mottled with evil and good! year of
         forebodings! year of the youth I love!
   Year of comets and meteors transient and strange!--lo! even here, one
         equally transient and strange!
   As I flit through you hastily, soon to fall and be gone, what is this
         book,
   What am I myself but one of your meteors

YEAR that trembled and reel'd beneath me!
   Your summer wind was warm enough--yet the air I breathed froze me;
   A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me;
   Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself;
   Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?
   And sullen hymns of defeat

YEARS of the modern! years of the unperform'd!
   Your horizon rises--I see it parting away for more august dramas;
   I see not America only--I see not only Liberty's nation, but other
         nations preparing;
   I see tremendous entrances and exits--I see new combinations--I see
         the solidarity of races;
   I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world's
         stage;
   (Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the acts
         suitable to them closed?)
   I see Freedom, completely arm'd, and victorious, and very haughty,
         with Law on one side, and Peace on the other,
   A stupendous Trio, all issuing forth against the idea of caste;
   --What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?
   I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions;         
   I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken;
   I see the landmarks of European kings removed;
   I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others give
         way;)
   --Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day;
   Lo! how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest;
   His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere--he colonizes the
         Pacific, the archipelagoes;
   With the steam-ship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the
         wholesale engines of war,
   With these, and the world-spreading factories, he interlinks all
         geography, all lands;
   --What whispers are these, O lands, running ahead of you, passing
         under the seas?                                             
   Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the
         globe?
   Is humanity forming, en-masse?--for lo! tyrants tremble, crowns grow
         dim;
   The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine
         war;
   No one knows what will happen next--such portents fill the days and
         nights;
   Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to
         pierce it, is full of phantoms;
   Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me;
   This incredible rush and heat--this strange extatic fever of dreams,
         O years!
   Your dreams, O year, how they penetrate through me! (I know not
         whether I sleep or wake!)
   The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind
         me,
   The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon
         me.                                                          
         What can a yellow glove mean in a world of motorcars and governments? 


I was small, there was too much to remember. One day, waving at a stream—the ice had cracked, winter chipping down, soon we would sail boats and roll into ditches—I let a glove go. Into the stream, sucked under the street. Since when did streets have mouths? I walked home on a desperate road. Gloves cost money. We didn’t have much. I would tell no one. I would wear the yellow glove that was left and keep the other hand in a pocket. I knew my mother’s eyes had tears they had not cried yet, I didn’t want to be the one to make them flow. It was the prayer I spoke secretly, folding socks, lining up donkeys in windowsills. To be good, a promise made to the roaches who scouted my closet at night. If you don’t get in my bed, I will be good. And they listened. I had a lot to fulfill. 

The months rolled down like towels out of a machine. I sang and drew and fattened the cat. Don’t scream, don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t fight—you could hear it anywhere. A pebble could show you how to be smooth, tell the truth. A field could show how to sleep without walls. A stream could remember how to drift and change—next June I was stirring the stream like a soup, telling my brother dinner would be ready if he’d only hurry up with the bread, when I saw it. The yellow glove draped on a twig. A muddy survivor. A quiet flag. 

Where had it been in the three gone months? I could wash it, fold it in my winter drawer with its sister, no one in that world would ever know. There were miracles on Harvey Street. Children walked home in yellow light. Trees were reborn and gloves traveled far, but returned. A thousand miles later, what can a yellow glove mean in a world of bankbooks and stereos? 


Part of the difference between floating and going down. 

Yes, Atthis, you may be sure 
 
				Even in Sardis 
Anactoria will think often of us 

 
of the life we shared here, when you seemed 
to her and your singing pleased her best 
 
Now among Lydian women she in her 
turn stands first as the red- 
fingered moon rising at sunset takes 
 
precedence over stars around her; 
her light spreads equally 
on the salt sea and fields thick with bloom 
 
Delicious dew purs down to freshen 
roses, delicate thyme 
and blossoming sweet clover; she wanders 
 
aimlessly, thinking of gentle 
Atthis, her heart hanging 
heavy with longing in her little breast 
 
She shouts aloud, Come! we know it; 
thousand-eared night repeats that cry 
across the sea shining between us


 
Kind and cool, 
He teaches everywhere, 
As hilarious as a joker, 
I wish he was always our teacher. 

One day Tuna Toni
Came me and played, 
Other children played too
In eager they said.

"Grandfather Grandfather
What is called greed? 
Our teacher said yesterday
"Children, it is poisonous seed


I said to children, 
"Yes, 
Poisonous seeds originate
Poisonous trees spread everywhere, 
Greed sprouts greedy
Who harms other in dare? 

Greediness is bad quality
Does harm to people, 
Greedy man hurts other
For desired things ample.

Children, be aware of
Greediness and you play, 
Do your duties daily
In time, do not delay


I advised them in love, 
Said, dear children, 

"Honour your superior
And love to all, 
And get peace, love and doll


"Yes Grandpapa yes"
Said they and frisk, 
I think, How simple! 
They are; they have no risk. 

Yes, I was born Haitian
I was born in pain
Like all of you my friends
Give me your hands
And I shall give you my shoulders
My strong and virile side to cry on
I shall send you tropical flowers
Every other day, so you can carry on
Yes, I was born in the Caribbean
Like you with a great deal of pain
You and I were not born in vain
We're living on the plains, on the mountains
With innumerable minor sins
Praying that we will be forgiven
So one day, we will be in Heaven
Yes, I was born American
I was born in pain
To love my fellow men and women
To protect the sick, the weak, and the poor
Do you want me to say more? 
Once upon a time, all Americans
From the North, South, And Central regions
Used to be fair, good, caring and passionate
Things have changed for the worst. Hate
Racism and sexism dominate the discourse
I'm praying that we change course
Very soon
Before the moon
Comes crashing to destroy Mother Earth
That we're fighting for. This land is my turf
Your home, ours, and theirs. We're all migrants
Immigrants, visitors, guests, passengers, inhabitants
Of this globe, which is constantly turning
Seeking a new winter, summer, fall and spring
Yes, I was born Haitian
I am constantly in pain
Yearning for a better day like you
Searching for a sweeter dew
A new dawn, and a better life like you.


Ah! Ah! Ah! Smile
So you can put me in Heaven
Yes, it is your quintessential smile
The way you carry yourself
The way you carry your purse
The gaze in your eyes
The flowers on your thighs
The caramel on your lips
And the cadence of your hips
I love seeing you walking
I enjoy hearing you talking
Oh! Your smile sends me to Heaven
Please smile, smile again
Yes, it is your contagious smile
I love how you swing your hips
I enjoy staring at your lips
Criss cross in front of me again
Walk by my side again
Swing at the jazz beat
Fly like your feet
Were wings and petals
I love hearing your sandals
I can easily identify you
Your aroma, your scent, your smell
You remind me of a lost angel
Yes, I am talking about you
It is all of the above
It is every that I care to omit
It is you, my beautiful dove
Yes, it your sweet smile, a bit
And a lot of your incredible smile
Oh! You got style
It is you who put me in Heaven
Every time you smile; smile again
And again, to relieve my pain
Ah! Ah! Ah! Smile again
Span, span like a fan
I am a friend, I am a fan
Ah! Ah! Ah! I am in Heaven
And you are the most beautiful woman. 


I wrote a funny poem, and then I wrote one more
After several years I'd written twice a score
Humour With Lemon Pepper Sauce sounded a title good to me
So I went to a recording studio and put the lot on a CD

This fabulous fiesta I hope provides a feast
For all digestive systems, children's not the least
Currently my CD's are sitting patiently in their cases
Strewn around my abode in tucked away places

I'd love to get them out there, proudly on display
But so far all I'm hearing is nay, nay, nay
I'm hoping to find someone who's heard of the word yes
It's only a tiny word but it can lead to great success

In the common vernacular it's called a win/win situation
One that culminates in a joyful celebration
I raise a toast to those who don't shout no, no, no
But are willing to give my CD a red hot go


Yes, the Dead speak to us.
This town belongs to the Dead, to the Dead and to the Wilderness.
 
Back of the clamps on a fireproof door they hold the papers of the Dead in a house here
And when two living men fall out, when one says the Dead spoke a Yes, and the other says the Dead spoke a No, they go then together to this house.
 
They loosen the clamps and haul at the hasps and try their keys and curse at the locks and the combination numbers.
For the teeth of the rats are barred and the tongues of the moths are outlawed and the sun and the air of wind is not wanted.
 
They open a box where a sheet of paper shivers, in a dusty corner shivers with the dry inkdrops of the Dead, the signed names.
Here the ink testifies, here we find the say-so, here we learn the layout, now we know where the cities and farms belong.
Dead white men and dead red men tested each other with shot and knives: they twisted each others' necks: land was yours if you took and kept it.

 
How are the heads the rain seeps in, the rain-washed knuckles in sod and gumbo?
 
Where the sheets of paper shiver,
Back of the hasps and handles,
Back of the fireproof clamps,
 
  They read what the fingers scribbled, who the land belongs to now—it is herein provided, it is hereby stipulated—the land and all appurtenances thereto and all deposits of oil and gold and coal and silver, and all pockets and repositories of gravel and diamonds, dung and permanganese, and all clover and bumblebees, all bluegrass, johnny-jump-ups, grassroots, springs of running water or rivers or lakes or high spreading trees or hazel bushes or sumach or thorn-apple branches or high in the air the bird nest with spotted blue eggs shaken in the roaming wind of the treetops—

 
So it is scrawled here,
"I direct and devise
So and so and such and such,"
And this is the last word.
There is nothing more to it.

 
In a shanty out in the Wilderness, ghosts of to-morrow sit, waiting to come and go, to do their job.
They will go into the house of the Dead and take the shivering sheets of paper and make a bonfire and dance a deadman's dance over the hissing crisp.

In a slang their own the dancers out of the Wilderness will write a paper for the living to read and sign:
The dead need peace, the dead need sleep, let the dead have peace and sleep, let the papers of the Dead who fix the lives of the Living, let them be a hissing crisp and ashes, let the young men and the young women forever understand we are through and no longer take the say-so of the Dead;

Let the dead have honor from us with our thoughts of them and our thoughts of land and all appurtenances thereto and all deposits of oil and gold and coal and silver, and all pockets and repositories of gravel and diamonds, dung and permanganese, and all clover and bumblebees, all bluegrass, johnny-jump-ups, grassroots, springs of running water or rivers or lakes or high spreading trees or hazel bushes or sumach or thornapple branches or high in the air the bird nest with spotted blue eggs shaken in the roaming wind of the treetops.
 
And so, it is a shack of ghosts, a lean-to they have in the Wilderness, and they are waiting and they have learned strange songs how easy it is to wait and how anything comes to those who wait long enough and how most of all it is easy to wait for death, and waiting, dream of new cities. 


Can bring about change


Yes, we all belong to same old school
Pool of swimming  of wisdom does rule
We definitely belong to same old school.

Science neither defines nor shares love
How does rain runs in cycle, flies dove? 
Who gives this nature, universe as glove? 
Who is power super we know he stays above? 

Moving in space you see rays of new light
Billions of stars you do not tell right
Who hangs you all you move in the bright, 
How amazing is in space science sees night.

Can you share a drop of happiness to me? 
Can you wipe out out my agony it you see? 
I know you can never answer why, why is bee

We belong to his school to know life's tool
Life has certain meaning that makes us cool
Yes dear, we all belong to same old school. 

when He created the giraffe He was drunk
when He created narcotics He was high
and when He created suicide He was low

when He created you lying in bed
He knew what He was doing
He was drunk and He was high
and He created the mountians and the sea and fire at the same time

He made some mistakes
but when He created you lying in bed
He came all over His Blessed Universe.

Yesterday, the sunshine made the air glow
pushing me like a sixteen-year-old
to toss my shirt off, and run along the river shore,
splashing in the water, wading out to the reeds,
my heart an ancient Yaki drum
and I believed,
          more than believed,
          the air beneath trees was female blue dancers
          I approached, and there in the dry leaves, in the crisp twigs,
          I turned softly as if dancing with a blue woman made of air,
                                                                                           sunlight,
                   in shrub-weed skirts.
                   I knew the dance that would make the river water
                   smile glistening ever silvering,
                   I knew the dance steps that praised my ancestors.


Yeah, I wanted to write you a poem woman
for two days,
and today it was gray and snowy and overcast,
         about how I startled the mallards from their shallow
refuge beneath the Russian olive trees
and how the male purposely
                   came close to me
                   diverting my attention to it
         its female love went the other way
         risking its life,
         that's what I saw,
the male fly before the hunter's rifles, circle in sights of hunters
and take the shots, the roaring rifle blast
                                              after blast
and circle beyond over the fields to meet its female companion.

That's how I miss you, that's how I wanted to write you a poem
since we left
         you one way
         me another way. I was the male
         taking with me the hunters that would harm you
         risking my heart so yours wouldn't be hurt,
         fronting myself as possible prey
         so you could escape,
         that kind of poem
                   I am writing you now.

Circling as hunters aim down on me
while you rise, rise, rise into the blue sky
         and meet me over in the next fields.

         I wanted to write you a poem for two days now
                  to tell you how happy I was,
                  seeing a white crane arc
                           between banks in the irrigation ditch
                           with furious efforts, its big wings flapping
                                       like an awkward nine-year-old kid
                                       much taller than the others his age
                                       with size twelve sneakers
                                       flapping down the basketball court.

But once the white crane
found its balance, its wings their grace, it glided more perfectly
than a ballet dancer's leap across air,
                  all of its feathers ballet dancer's toes,
                  all of its feathers delicate dancers
                  all of its feathers, in motion
                           made me believe in myself,
but more,
                  when it rose, swooped up,
                  the line of ascent up
                  made me think of the curve of your spine,
                  how I traced my finger down your spine
                  when you slept,
your spine
                  is the ascent of the crane
                  toward the sunshine,
and my hands my face my torso and chest and legs and hips
became air, a blue cold artic air
you glided up in your song of winter love. 


I was watching the sun pass threw the house, and listening to
the laughter echo about.
  I was watching the critters outside at play. 

Try to figure out
 what they had to say


Look deep into their eyes, try to see inside.
    I was watching the wind talk with the trees, watching the way
  the branches bent in the breeze.
     I was watching time come to a slow, coming back to all I know.
   I felt the peace settle in my heart, as I became apart.  
      All that surrounds me, all that I see, becoming one with me.
          Then a song came along, and took it away. 
                                    Brought me back from Yesterday


leave the pain of yesterday
leave the worries of yesteryear
welcome the day of tomorrow
although morrow is in the first row
and the vision doesn't exist
still aspire for the best. 


Yesterday
I felt the sun 
It warmed my face
My life was fun

Yesterday
My thoughts were free
And all the world
Belonged to me

Yesterday
Your love was mine
And everything
Was so divine

Yesterday
The words were true
My heart belonged
To only you


The gold-hoarder walked in his palace park and with him walked his troubles. And over his head hovered worries as a vulture hovers over a carcass, until he reached a beautiful lake surrounded by magnificent marble statuary. 

He sat there pondering the water which poured from the mouths of the statues like thoughts flowing freely from a lover's imagination, and contemplating heavily his palace which stood upon a knoll like a birth-mark upon the cheek of a maiden. His fancy revealed to him the pages of his life's drama which he read with falling tears that veiled his eyes and prevented him from viewing man's feeble additions to Nature. 

He looked back with piercing regret to the images of his early life, woven into pattern by the gods, until he could no longer control his anguish. He said aloud, "Yesterday I was grazing my sheep in the green valley, enjoying my existence, sounding my flute, and holding my head high. Today I am a prisoner of greed. Gold leads into gold, then into restlessness and finally into crushing misery. 

"Yesterday I was like a singing bird, soaring freely here and there in the fields. Today I am a slave to fickle wealth, society's rules, and city's customs, and purchased friends, pleasing the people by conforming to the strange and narrow laws of man. I was born to be free and enjoy the bounty of life, but I find myself like a beast of burden so heavily laden with gold that his back is breaking. 

"Where are the spacious plains, the singing brooks, the pure breeze, the closeness of Nature? Where is my deity? I have lost all! Naught remains save loneliness that saddens me, gold that ridicules me, slaves who curse to my back, and a palace that I have erected as a tomb for my happiness, and in whose greatness I have lost my heart. 

"Yesterday I roamed the prairies and the hills together with the Bedouin's daughter; Virtue was our companion, Love our delight, and the moon our guardian. Today I am among women with shallow beauty who sell themselves for gold and diamonds. 

"Yesterday I was carefree, sharing with the shepherds all the joy of life; eating, playing, working, singing, and dancing together to the music of the heart's truth. Today I find myself among the people like a frightened lamb among the wolves. As I walk in the roads, they gaze at me with hateful eyes and point at me with scorn and jealousy, and as I steal through the park I see frowning faces all about me. 

"Yesterday I was rich in happiness and today I am poor in gold. 

"Yesterday I was a happy shepherd looking upon his head as a merciful king looks with pleasure upon his contented subjects. Today I am a slave standing before my wealth, my wealth which robbed me of the beauty of life I once knew. 

"Forgive me, my Judge! I did not know that riches would put my life in fragments and lead me into the dungeons of harshness and stupidity. What I thought was glory is naught but an eternal inferno
 


He gathered himself wearily and walked slowly toward the palace, sighing and repeating, "Is this what people call wealth? Is this the god I am serving and worshipping? Is this what I seek of the earth? Why can I not trade it for one particle of contentment? Who would sell me one beautiful thought for a ton of gold? Who would give me one moment of love for a handful of gems? Who would grant me an eye that can see others' hearts, and take all my coffers in barter?" 

As he reached the palace gates he turned and looked toward the city as Jeremiah gazed toward Jerusalem. He raised his arms in woeful lament and shouted, "Oh people of the noisome city, who are living in darkness, hastening toward misery, preaching falsehood, and speaking with stupidity.  

until when shall you remain ignorant? Unit when shall you abide in the filth of life and continue to desert its gardens? Why wear you tattered robes of narrowness while the silk raiment of Nature's beauty is fashioned for you? The lamp of wisdom is dimming; it is time to furnish it with oil. The house of true fortune is being destroyed; it is time to rebuild it and guard it. The thieves of ignorance have stolen the treasure of your peace; it is time to retake it!" 

At that moment a poor man stood before him and stretched forth his hand for alms. As he looked at the beggar, his lips parted, his eyes brightened with a softness, and his face radiated kindness. It was as if the yesterday he had lamented by the lake had come to greet him. He embraced the pauper with affection and filled his hands with gold, and with a voice sincere with the sweetness of love he said, "Come back tomorrow and bring with you your fellow sufferers. All your possessions will be restored
 


He entered his palace saying, "Everything in life is good; even gold, for it teaches a lesson. Money is like a stringed instrument; he who does not know how to use it properly will hear only discordant music. Money is like love; it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and it enlivens the other who turns it upon his fellow man


"You say that everything is very simple and interesting
it makes me feel very wistful, like reading a great Russian novel does

i am terribly bored
sometimes it is like seeing a bad movie
other days, more often, it's like having an acute disease of the kidney
god knows it has nothing to do with the heart
nothing to do with people more interesting than myself
yak yak
that's an amusing thought
how can anyone be more amusing than oneself
how can anyone fail to be
can i borrow your forty-five
i only need one bullet preferably silver
if you can't be interesting at least you can be a legend
(but i hate all that crap)


Yesterday's beauty is mayhap unattractive today.
Youth is short-lived; it changes every hour of the day.
At times, what remain are the core and the essence.
As we all know, the prevailing factor is common sense.

Babies are born with their beautiful smile, 
But will return to the tombs with an eerie style.
Yesterday's beauty will regrettably vanish, 
With time. Weakness will crop up in their niche.

In spite all, time is not the foreign nemesis; 
We are. Because our expectations and analyses
Are hollow, unrealistic, and unconvincing.

Spring flowers and the fall leaves will become dirt, 
To nourish the soil and the women cougars will flirt, 
In vain.  Beauty is relative, and time is eternally king.


Yesterday's dawn
With her unique horizon, 
And her sunrise of 
florescent light
And Multi-colored skies—
All momentary beauty—
Is forever gone, 
Making the way 
For tomorrow's dawn, 
Which is yet to come.


I don’t want to sleep so soon

Yesterday’s dream is still raw

 

Triggering a dust-storm in the eyes

Raising red dust, comes sleep

Tuptup, flap the doors of lashes

And just close by themselves

 

Dream, like a flood, comes


Carrying the broken logs of memories


As if they were rafts

 

I become homeless

In yeasterday’s sleep

I trembled in fear

In yesterday’s flood

No, not so soon

Yesterday’s dream is still raw

 

Dream, an invisible wound—

Inflicted upon by a reluctant sleep
That comes and goes at its will


Dream, the secret of
Death of imagination and fear
It appears in thousand postures
Like a friend, dead
Yesterday’s dream—
Still raw-

 



Only fools live in the future
only the regretful
live in the past

but very few live in the now
the hardest part of all

dreams of what to come
can be changed
and the past can be accepted

but the now? 
Can only be survived

Soon it will be the past
then we will regretfully acceptpainted red
in the memory wall
is the Juicy call
of yester lives


young alive
the air was fresh
the sky was blue
the moon was full
the song was sweet

very touch was an imprint
very look was an albumn
very sight was a film
very taste was Superb! 

smelling innocence
and toyed with eternal sense
then smiles were sprouting
like stars in the summer skies

limbs were dancing
likes were twitching
hearts were squealing
hopes were skating

the glimmer in the eyes
the glitter in the looks
the twitter in the tone
and the butter in those fakes

buds are full of hopes
unripened seeds are 
future's fruits
uncorked bottle
treasures the  tastiest Eve


Dreams are made of pasts
when Age is greying fast
Tomorrows are born of yesterdays
yet, yesterdays roots of Tomorrows
water them, feed them, the dried trunk of fate. 


Strangely enough
This world is ridden
With vampires
Vampires not interested
In sucking blood out of you
But interested in spilling your blood
On the surface of the earth
To create gore and terror
Whether in stark day light
Or during a normal night
Their fangs are hidden
From all tech-savvy gadgets
They feign innocence
As they casually stroll
Amidst thick crowds
Once the job is done
They vanish as if at the day break. 



I've turned insensitive
To death
I'm now sensitive 
To life
Of late
I anticipate death
At every corner
To me theses days
Life is but a distant cry
Why shed tears
Over the inevitable? 
And commonplace? 
Why regale
Over what passes off
At an abrupt turn? 


Somewhere
In some corner of the earth
Collective wails rise and fall
Deafening the earth's ears



when i woke up from 
a night of insomnia 
i found myself surrounded 
by the newness in 
my environment 
and the newness i found
in you and me 

then i understood 
that i died once again 
to take yet another birth




Leaves falling yet in town! 
The Autumn Season. 

Ermintrude the echidna
 lost her diamond tiara.
Her husband trying to be kind
 softly whispered never mind
It never suited your behind.

Coromandel crocodile
 whilst swimming in the River Nile
Yawned and swallowed a canoe.
his mother cried this will not do
You make me so ashamed of you.

Caroline the kinkajou
liked a glass of wine or two
Which made her act indecently
 so that very frequently
She was confined for her own safety.

Sebastian a young male skunk 
was a most aggressive drunk.
Until he met his waterloo 
and picked upon a kangaroo.
Who showed him what a roo can do.

Gustavus gorilla thumped his chest
 to show the world he was the best
When a stray hunter with a gun
 shot Gustavus just for fun
I do not think he should have done.

An octopus can count to eight
 the number of his tentacles
I’m sure you will appreciate
 it’s one of natur’s miracles
At least I think so more or less.

We rattle snakes are dangerous
 but only if you anger us.
We aren’t aggressive naturally 
We much prefer to lie quietly
and will do if you leave us be.



where is the room of reeks! 
Green when laughs  wild 
Sky is open by beauty of silence
World smiles across its spumes

soul never redeems by grimace
ocean smiles through its waves
even storm mills all through 
may be darkness there redounding

shadow slowly melts away
breeze still whispers ever again

warmth enlightens room of reason
as gleams of love bristles from above 
leaf may not stop its sway 
even being chilled by breath of snow


YET, yet, ye downcast hours, I know ye also;
   Weights of lead, how ye clog and cling at my ankles!
   Earth to a chamber of mourning turns--I hear the o'erweening, mocking
         voice,
   Matter is conqueror--matter, triumphant only, continues onward.


   Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me,
   The call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm'd, uncertain,
   The Sea I am quickly to sail, come tell me,
   Come tell me where I am speeding--tell me my destination.


   I understand your anguish, but I cannot help you,
   I approach, hear, behold--the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes,
         your mute inquiry,                                           
   Whither I go from the bed I recline on, come tell me:
   Old age, alarm'd, uncertain--A young woman's voice, appealing to me
         for comfort;
   A young man's voice, Shall I not escape


Rainy season. Boiled corn. Inseparable. Which comes first? In the city of ours. The way we treat rain, must sound like man's invention. Rain and corn. 

Appear around the same time. People enjoy the corn. Grumble about the rain. Why does it rain in the day? It can pour down to its content when we lay. Down for the night. But I ask again. Which comes first? Corn? Rain? Is this the rainy season.  Or a reason to feast in boiled corn? There are corns. And there are corns. Brought to the capital city. People boil and eat them. The way I see it: boiled corn has taken over the menu. At home outta home. The street vendors selling corns. Give such flavor to the wet season. Standing before steamy corns. Holding their hooks. When you approach your nostrils will be filled with, such sweet smell of boiled corns! Must be fun selling what you're boiling. Right there on the spot. Look at the steel midjas full of coal fire. Huge steel pots full of corn. You can put more and more. Build blocks of corn towers!  Cover them with plastic bags. Marvel at your expertise. Delight your customers. Bask in the smell of corns!

happy occasions.


"Dear Wanker-hope you like ‘em 
‘cos that’s as near you are ever 
going to get to them.  

ever ever again! "


"Bye bye boy! 

Throughout the years 
these alternating hues of
northern lands -
blue-to-green-to-grey -
have borne my faithful aureole
of life

And as I pause, 
caught within a dearth of clearer thought -
my gaze blank upon the heather -
I feel through blackening panes
my Autumn -
my thick'ning blood
in tune

I wish to be the stoutened oak -
the giant Quercus, 
like a rock
silhouetted purple under sun's wake; 
through the many generations
it has claimed its rights o' land, 
become the land

The background of my room 
flows in thermals; 
Elgar calms my inner ear; 
port hangs heavy on a weary hand, 
my faith soothes in cool robusto clouds


In me, I'm never alone: 

I peer further: 
The way of Yorkshire stone -
a never-ending path 
dissolving in the deathless fields; 
dry stone walls
rise up thro' their lichen camouflage, 
line the lineage of Yorkshire's farmstead lives  
(reminding me
that yonder hill, dale, moor and mind
I'll die inside the nithered air
of country wilds)     

At altitude
where scale becomes a new perspective, 
enormity of evolution hovers 
in its empire of the skies: 
Tho' the red kite never smiles
(except inside his head upon a kill) , 
Aerial self-possession  
travels in his eye; 
he's on! to other realms 
to leave us in the dusk
to shiver through the air's anticipation: 


Night: 

The scarred moon spreads out
its yellowed silver, 
smudges paved strata
honed from cloud; 
below, a hulk of Friesians
somehow cozied up
in their refrigerated cosmos, 
lashes hanging on the air - 
their en chamade of silence, 
mantra

The last blue vestige
bleeds black; 
a cutting breeze
sharpens the bone, 
chills the marrow, 
deepens death


Ice

It's bloody cold 
beyond the South 
where all becomes the snow

Yet my heart rests
In Yorkshire's moors ‘n' dales
subsumed
below

in the feel of a moment
gripped in the crystalline abstraction
of a diamond bonding-

at my first sight, 
a young sheep, 
a kitten, 
or a chic You looked to me; 
but as the moments passed by, 
I kept on exploring You
and found to my sheer surprise
a ripe mind, 
a deep thought, 
a razor-pen You kept and still keep-
a keen observer, 
a bright writer, 
a sharp critic; 


I felt your soul like a lighted candle
Sometimes kindling the light
though sometimes idly burning away
but always on the flickering flame
fighting against the bold blows
and strokes of critical winds-
I felt the hardening of your heart
by constant fighting
within and without


You made me up and happy
You made me down and sad
but never annoyed me
I likened you to Stephen D.
I likened you to the bard of fancy
I wished to write an ode to You-

Reading You is a wonder feel, 
One might feel sitting either
in a submarine
or a space-shuttle..
you have always been so dead sure
beyond being challenged ever-
I witnessed deaths of ego hard
With no offence, with no blame
People let you rule their moods
Willingly. 


when in all crystalline way
they love the killer-! ! 

You are the supreme one
You are the friend, 
Young you are always
You are never end.


You know all, love all
Yokel to yuppie, 
Yelp you listen and fulfil the-
Yen of people and puppy.

You are the father and
You are the mother, 
You are the heart of the heart
You are the brother.

You are the light and 
You are the might, 
You are the day and 
You are the night.


Yeoman asks for water
Yew grows beautiful for you, 
Yippee is your morning 
Yummy is food, evening and dew.

You father guide us
You lead us in right mood, 
Yoga or meditation we do
Your grace is nectar and good. 


Oh, my lover, 
How much I am missing you! 
Your smile-the sun, 
Makes me feel warm.

Oh, my lover, 
How much I am missing you! 
Your voice- the music, 
Makes me feel sweet.

Oh, my lover, 
How much I am missing you! 
The distance between you and me, 
Is the one between past and future.

I can see you, 
I can feel you, 
But, 
I cannot touch you.

Oh, my lover, 
How much-
I am missing you


You are like a tiny plant 
With so many tender leaves
And numerous flowers 
Spreading your sweet fragrance 
In the garden of my heart
Day and night - every time.

You are like a song bird 
Sitting in the branch
Of my unhappy mind 
And singing a sweet melody
Filled with love and happiness
Only to gladden my sad heart. 

You are like an oasis 
In the midst of a desert 
Offering fresh air
And cool shadow 
To my weary heart
And my burning mind. 

You are like the gentle wind 
Risen out of the amorous sea 
In the season of summer
Blowing over the land
Of my scorching mind 
To soothe my heart.

Coming from heaven 
And soaring around me 
To heal my lovelorn heart 
And to make me happy
With your sacred love.


To reveal my heart for all of time
Tearing love Immortalised, 
Distilled to fourteen lines of rhyme. 
Or if like Robert Burns, the rogue, 
In harvest fields beneath the moon, 
I'd liken love to a red, red rose
And wrap it in a fine Scots tune. 
Or if with Yeats’ simplicity
I could brush away the years 
To when being young and foolish
Brought us love, regret and tears. 
Then perhaps I would not feel
As Neruda, torn in two, 
Caught 
Between the ice and fire
Broken, smashed, 
Yet loving
You. 


You aren't my dad
You make me sad
You make me feel bad
You make me cry
You make me sigh
So, now i'm going to say good bye
Good bye! 


When I close my eyes 
I can see you, 

When I dream
 I can feel you, 

When I am afar 
You are near, 

When I touch a rose
Its your intoxication, 

When I meet you
At the station, 

You wing my thoughts
My angel

I’m in heaven, 
Again. 


You alone made my heart flutter like a flag
You alone trampled on my emotions like a rag
You alone sang me songs like an evening bird
But now you're acting really crazy and weird

You promised me you'd give an everlasting bliss
You said if I'm with you, there's nothing I'll miss
You even promised to walk with me down the aisle
Now all I do is sit down all by myself and cry


I miss all the funny times we'd throw our pillows
Now all I get from our memory is constant sorrow
I miss all the nights that I called you on phone
Those wonderful nights now remind me of you alone



i heard
your passion 
pigmenting new desire
as sweet as grapes 
on summer breeze
crystallizing 
to glimpse of sunshine

when dry leaves 
separate from vines
gently fluttering to gravity
unwilling to touch ground
i focus my eyes on you
looking at your inner soul
finding my way deep
that only you
could keep
but i insist
you’re remarkable


Give me a second, and I’ll give you an eternity
Give me your heart, and I’ll give you my soul
Give me love, and I’ll give it back
You know I’m always here, its just a fact
I could be your something, and I’d make you my everything
I don’t need much,  Just what you can give
I could love you longer than I live
Forever Yours Is what I’ll be
In my arms, I’ll make you see
You and I were meant to be


I explain quietly. You
hear me shouting. You
try a new tack. I
feel old wounds reopen.

You see both sides. I
see your blinkers. I
am placatory. You
sense a new selfishness.

I am a dove. You
recognize the hawk. You
offer an olive branch. I
feel the thorns.

You bleed. I
see crocodile tears. I
withdraw. You
reel from the impact. 

You make me cry
You say yu need me
You say you love me
You leave me

I tell you i love you
I say i need you
I will never leave you
I love you


You keep playing games with my heart
I try to hold it in
You break my heart again
I fall into a pit with no bottom

You are the only one that can save me
I need you and where are you
You leaveme in my time of need
I die with out you 

I'm dead without youyou and i
mere illusions
created through
this body to test our
strength and resolve to
loosen this grip on the earth

you and i
mere shadows
of a great light playing
an eternal hide and seek



Many years ago
When we were young 
And deeply in love, 
We once sat in a park-
The sun was setting, 
Making way for the moon-
The birds were coming back to roost-
Suddenly you drew me closer-
With your arms round me 
And with your voice earnest, 
You said, 'Marry me, 
And you will never have to write
Poems like these


Many years later
When we were no longer so young
But still deeply in love, 
We once stood among the mountains
On a valley-
The sun was setting, 
Making way for the moon-
The birds were coming back to roost-
We were smiling into a camera-
Suddenly other things became more important
And the moment was gone-
We were now part of a large crowd
And I began knitting my thoughts and memories
Into another poem.(know that they loved you)         


Our history closely 
Mirrors the shape of our clay
Both, reclusive and introverts
Each secreted in distant and
Separate island sanctuary

You ditched out before me
Or maybe I did, before you-
No matter, we rarely venture back 
As if our hearts were ex-patriots of city-self
Besides, they believed we had found paradise

But, did they not direct our paths? 
I know they were our glue
They too, were reclusive and, still
We loved them beyond belief
Yet, they also, lived apart-



Like a river flow
With passion of melody so down and low
With an embrace so warm and tender
We will grow fonder

You are my love and I am your reflection
Every season there is more attraction
You and I, we are the founder of love
That flap like the wings of the dove 

You and I can climb the highest mountain peak
Cause love is there for us to pick
Even the stars aren't far
Cause with you silk become fur

You and I, we are the light of heaven
When I am with you I am forgiven
There is no hide even in a cave
Because you and I, we are for love


'Nothing is stronger than love'

You and I, under vast skies
Hands held, eyes locked
Feeling the surge of waves
Beneath the cold floor
Our entwined hands, the trees
Under the moon
Shy and warm from love
Flowing upstream
The smile in your eyes
The blush blossoming on my cheeks
A treasure to hold inside the mirror
Of dreams
How the crescent moon
In conversation with the brightest star looks
So do we look, together
Wrapped in love
Stealing the glow of heavens, 
Exhibiting in our eyes
The glory of immortal love.


My morning sun and my evening star, 
The reason for every step I take, 
And help with every move I make, 
Your voice a comfort to my ears, 
With arms to protect me from my fears, 
I'm constantly surrounded by your love, 
You cohere to me, like a tight fitting glove, 
Without you, I would a 'no one' be, 
For I am you, and you are me! 

Look down upon the town in which you live
And be ashamed.
Look down upon white folks   
And upon yourselves   
And be ashamed
That such supine poverty exists there,
That such stupid ignorance breeds children there
Behind such humble shelters of despair—
That you yourselves have not the sense to care
Nor the manhood to stand up and say
I dare you to come one step nearer, evil world,
With your hands of greed seeking to touch my throat, 
I dare you to come one step nearer me:
                        When you can say that
                        you will be free


And here face down beneath the sun
And here upon earth's noonward height
To feel the always coming on
The always rising of the night:

To feel creep up the curving east
The earthy chill of dusk and slow
Upon those under lands the vast
And ever climbing shadow grow

And strange at Ecbatan the trees
Take leaf by leaf the evening strange
The flooding dark about their knees
The mountains over Persia change

And now at Kermanshah the gate
Dark empty and the withered grass
And through the twilight now the late
Few travelers in the westward pass

And Baghdad darken and the bridge
Across the silent river gone
And through Arabia the edge
Of evening widen and steal on

And deepen on Palmyra's street
The wheel rut in the ruined stone
And Lebanon fade out and Crete
high through the clouds and overblown

And over Sicily the air
Still flashing with the landward gulls
And loom and slowly disappear
The sails above the shadowy hulls

And Spain go under and the shore
Of Africa the gilded sand
And evening vanish and no more
The low pale light across that land


Nor now the long light on the sea:

And here face downward in the sun
To feel how swift how secretly
The shadow of the night comes on.  

You are like a charming flower 
Bloomed in the garden of heaven 
And like a butterfly I'm flying there. 

So many flowers spread sweet smell
In the garden of love and purity
And charm their lovers so badly
With their fragrance and beauty.

But I'm fascinated only by your beauty
And addicted to your smell and sweetness.
I rest upon your tender petals 
To make my mind lively and fresh.

You are overflown with sacred nectar.
Like a butterfly sitting upon your petals
I feel ecstatic to drink your holy nectar.

I care about the sun, the moon, the stars





You are a leader
Not a follower.
A date is a date, 
Go for the debate.
Whatever happened 
To their financial revolution? 
I thought that they could find solution
To the country who is saddened
And scared at their "laissez-faire" mentality: 
No common sense regulations for the economy.
What happened to Rush and Hannity? 
Let them swim in ignominy.


You go to Washington
Not as an Uncle Tom, 
But as a real leader, 
A great debater, 
A man with extraordinary common sense, 
And a patriot who will accept no cents
From corrupted lobbyists.
You and your team can remove the country
From this egregious economic abyss; 
For too long, they have been lying and messy.
This is tough time, the nation
Expects you to lead intelligently with passion, 
Not with voodoo economic theories.
You are expected to cut down the bad trees, 
So we can start clean, fresh and anew.
You are chosen among the few
In this critical juncture to be a leader, 
NOT A BUSINESS AS USUAL FOLLOWER.
They put the nation in pain, 
They put the world in a bin; 
You are expected to get us out of this elephant’s mess.
You are brilliant; you are going to do your very best. 
You are a leader
Not a follower.
A date is a date, 
Go for the debate.



as i prepare for bed, 
i know in my heart, 
that no one will be there for me but you.
no one left to comfort me, 
reminisce with from the day that no longer is, 
no one but you.

giving me strength for yet another day
giving me life to live each day
no one is there for me like you, 
no one cares for me as you.

your humbling acceptance of honor
is an act of righteousness, 
your choice to die for our sins
is an action that brightens us.
no one is there for me like you.

spiritually filling the room, 
basically comforting, 
always there for me. 


No artist do justice to your sublime splendor! 
A galaxy of endless beauty lives in you

Some folks don't need 
A reason to be special.
They just are.
And for that reason, 
You deserve the best. 


I asked you if I was PRETTY, you said no
I asked you if i was FAT, you said yes ofcorse 
I asked you if you WANT to be my friend, you said no 
I asked you if you would CRY if i walked away, you said no 
I heard enough, need to leave, and as i walke away 
you grabbed my hand and told me to stay
you said
You are not PRETTY, you are BEAUTFUL
the only thing FAT about you is your HEART 
I dont WANT to be your friend, I NEED to be your friend
and i wouldnt CRY if you walked away
i would DIE


The trouble with poverty, 
The people are so poor, 
They can't really affoard to be rich, 
Never you mind I just give them a helping hand. 

The problem with this, 
Is that the helping hand is a quick fix, 
What was designed to help, 
Has now lasted over years, 
There is no way out and end in sight, 
What a terrible and hoorible sight! 

We see, one, two, three and more generations, 
Living together on the floor, 
They are together in spirit and poverty, 
They are looking for us to break the cycle. 

This cycle can be broken 
Without a doubt, 
The problem is do we wanta, 
Not if we will. 


It may seem strange for a day or two, 
But the trouble with giving a helping helping hand, 
Is not becasue we do it, 
It is because we can. 


Americans are great, 
We are good, 
And we want to bless all of the others, 
However, when we give a handout, 
We are not giving a helping hand, 
Rather instead we do exactly that, 
Giving hand out and breading discontent. 

Now, the next time you giver to a chairity or a gift, 
Just remember who told you this, 
It is better to give than recieve. 
And it is better to give a hand up 
Than receive a handout


Eyes brightens
Blood flows 
Heavily through the veins
Means you are in love.

Mind enlightens
And wish to whistle
A song softly
Means you are in love.

Desire strengthens 
To look back
And see a person again
Means a message of love.

You both look back
And your eyes conveys
And a smile in your face blooms
Means you are in love.

Love means to me
Is a beautiful symphony
With positive energy
To live and share love to all


You are love ~ 

Nothing can compare, to the gift of your
beauty and brilliance. That you have
Bestowed upon me. Wrapped in the
soft glow of moonlight. You are all of the
wonders, that i'll ever yearn to see.

You are love ~
 
You are my rare pearl precious and unique
so sublime to discover. My diamond uncut 
pure and clear that I so revere. You could
never be compared to another.

You are love ~ 

You have made all of my life's dreams come true.
Painted the (gray skies)   that I once gazed upon, 
blue. 

The love you have shown. This love we now
own. 'Tis the greatest treasure to me! It shall go
on through each breaking dawn - 
For all of eternity. 




Opinions held stubbornly
 will be adhered to by each side
Because we do not want to see.

That we may be wrong possibly.
Brain washed by what we have been taught.
By teachers who most probably
 had not expended too much thought.

Passed on the tenets of their creed 
for which they had no evidence.
They merely listened and agreed
 which shows a lack of competence.

 A teacher should be confident
 that what he teaches is the truth.
Mere words are insufficient
 when you are educating youth.

Challenge all you have been taught.
Although in fact it may be true
Do not accept without much thought.
The currently prevailing view.

Each creed will claim they are correct.
 It ‘s human nature so to do
 This will not change. I don’t expect 
 We’ll ever know which one is true.

I was walking
in a field of tall grass
and you were the lion
stalking your prey

just wait until i've had my fill.
i've been grazing
and I don't want to go down
on an empty stomach. 

You are my mother
More supportive than a brother
You are my mother
More compassionate than a sister

You are my mother
My very important other
You are my mother
My first teacher and helper

You are my mother
Because of you I am greater and stronger
You are my mother 
Because of you I am richer and better

You are my mother
My love for you grows bigger and sweater
You are my mother
My love for you will last forever


The sun is smiling as I open my eyes
Birds serenading the awoken sky.
I watch from my window the sun climbing a hill
Spreading its glimmer so beautiful.

Trees catch the amber and red glow
Rising sun embracing me with love she bestows.
Caresses the clouds with her pink gleams
And sees her reflection in the crystal blue stream.

I look up at the cerulean sky
This view is that of celestial
Giving a blessing upon the terrestrial.

She gives me hope to conquer my day
Free my problems and take my sorrows away.
She quenches my soul with kind bliss
And injects myself with tenderness.

My dear girl you have me in a paradise
My dear beauty you have me mesmerised
Because you are my lovely sun rise.
I love you.


Of all the friends i have ever met
your the one i wont forget
and if i die before you do 
i will go to heaven and wait for you
just to prove our friendship is true 
im thankful to have a friend like you



"You are old, father William," the young man said,
"And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head --
Do you think, at your age, it is right?

"In my youth," father William replied to his son,
"I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again


"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
And you have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door --
Pray what is the reason for that?"

"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
"I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment -- one shilling a box --
Allow me to sell you a couple?"

"You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak --
Pray, how did you mange to do it?"

"In my youth," said his fater, "I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life


"You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as every;
Yet you balanced an eel on the tend of your nose --
What made you so awfully clever?"

"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
Said his father. "Don't give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?

Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs. 


Don't you ever let that get into you, 
Unspoken lies won't ever come true.
Your eyes are beautiful, believe me when I say
I know you’ll see it, someday
They say you’re a tragedy
But I say you are poetry
Even if you can’t see
Even if it doesn’t seems to be
Believe me
You are poetry.

Don’t you ever be afraid to fly, 
Even if they say you can’t, go on, try
Know that, if you fall – yes, perhaps you’ll fall – 
Yet, you will have tasted it all, 
Remember when they said you couldn’t? 
Remember when they said you shouldn’t? 
Life can be such an agony
But it can also be
Poetry
Believe me.


I know, you fear to hear they screaming 
The same words you’ve been whispering to the wind
To no one, 
All alone, 
Yes, I can hear
But don’t you dare to fear
They’ve said you couldn’t be free
And I say you are poetry
Can’t you see? 
You will see.


The worst lies you’ve been saying to a calm lake
As the pain comes, and you’re about to break
What you see, it’s in your eyes
Lies
Lies! 
They’ve said life is an agony, 
And it is! The definition of tragedy! 
But you, you are poetry.
You are poetry. 


she was innocent
smiling coyly
talking sweet
hugging softly
winking happily
and tasting lovely
they raped the poem girl
they took away her frock
and untied her petticoats
and tore apart her panties
and forced her to lie
upon a thorny bed
and mantled upon her bleeding core
and made her weep and sob with grief
the new genre of poets
they in the name of poetry
rape her and loot her beauties
and stuff with vulgar weeds
my dear poet virgin
adulterated in the hearts of men
who call their creations poetry. 


You are saved
My dear friends
Don't be afraid.

Don't be envious
My dear friends
You will be punished.


You will be protected
My dear friends
Close your eyes and surrender yourself  

You are searching.
Are you really searching? 
But how and where
You are searching.
What you are searching
That I can't say, 
But I must say
You are searching none.
I know no one is there, 
Nothing is there
And you are searching
Day and nights
And you are looking like
A harassed one. 


You are seen clearly
In the light of the sun, 
In the new moon night as well.

In this body I feel your presence, 
This body is meant for only that.


What ought to be done and
What ought not to be done 
That I know only by you here.

I have nothing to feel proud, 
I know without you the body is meaningless. 

You are seen clearly
In this body and to see you
Help of the eyes is not necessary.

It is all the mark of goodness. 


You are separate, 
I am separate, 
No needs to grieve
And why to grieve.
Who perceives what
Is still a matter 
Of search and research.
Time passes, calender changes
And still everyone is
Going on describing 
His own experiences.


You smiled and
I am trying to
Follow You my dear.

For this You are
Greeting me
In the form of
The sky trees air.

Be humble and
Meek and offer
Respect to others.

No lower no higher
And with You I am feeling
Better and better. 


Have you ever tried to read my psyche? 
Have you ever tried to make me happy? 
What may I expect from you, my darling? 
I can utter just - no, never, nothing


With a full hearted hope and dream
I wanted to walk with you for life time.
To deceive me you receded like a mirage. 
Our holy kinship ended only for your rage.

I thought, 'you are so lovely, so colourful'
I wanted to make my dream so beautiful
With your charming hue, with your loveliness
But you made my dream so dark, so colourless. 

I just wanted your magical touch and affinity
You might have filled my heart with felicity
And my eyes with the shine of happiness
But you threw me in the ocean of darkness. 

You are a fragrant bait with a fishing hook.
You are the poisonous water flowing in the brook.
Like a hunter you feel so delighted and happy
By trapping and killing the victim cleverly.  

Now I am too tired to rush towards thee.
You are so illusive, so egotistic, so touchy.
I don't need you; I don't need your kindness
As now I'm self dependent to lead my life in happiness. 


Special sister.
All the nice 
Things you do.

Special niece.
Special friend.
A special heart
Makes Special YOU. 


You are superior
To me, 
To all.
I bind me
But I am settled.
Again and again
I am rising
Just to reach you. 


You are Supreme, my dear
As You are with equanimity
As You look upon wellwishers
And neutrals mediators
Friends and foes relatives 
And inimicals, virtuous and sinful
With equanimity 
As You know the Ultimate Truth
As You realized Truth. 


You are taking, 
What is yours, 
That I know. 


You are testing me I know
I know you are testing my
Internal and external purity
O my dear please forgive
My fault if any as You know
To err is human and no one can
Deny human infallibility here
See I am straightness of mind
My senses my behaviour my belief
All are with you O my dear
I am yours till death and also
After death and this is true
This is the only truth. 



You are the plant of rose 
In the garden of my heart.
When I feel tired 
Working over the day, 
The fragrance of your roses
Make me lively and fresh.

You are the shining moon
In the sky of my mind.
When the sun sets
And night falls on my mind, 
Your charming silver beams
Vanish the darkness from my mind.

You are the showers of rain
In the days of my summer.
When my thoughts get scorched
With the heat of reality, 
You keep my creative thoughts safe
With the magical drops of rain. 

You are my love and life.
You are the fountain of joy.
Whenever I face any trouble
On the way of my journey, 
Like a fairy you appear before me
To protect me with your holy love.


Drink me; I’m sherbet
Play me; I’m your flute
Taste me; I’m a passion fruit.
Ignite me; I’m burning ember
Wear me; I’m sparkling amber
Cuddle me; I’m warm
Unleash me; I’m the storm.
Consume me; I’m poison 
Love me; I’m one in a zillion.


I’m your every season
And YOU are the reason.



The astronaut
is a privileged man
for he sees the world
from the height of its vantage point
above the circle of it's crystal globe
above and beyond the reach of any cloud
where the cold silence is ever so loud
he holds its blue magnificence.
In the centre of his eye
he sees the world the way it is
that is the world to an astronaut

is the greatest of the universe, 
he sees the world
from the pinnacle of it's stature
the world is his foot stool
inhabited by the common fool
and from higher than anyone else
he gazes upon its quiet grandeur.
In the centre of his eye
he sees the world the way it is


I am a simple man
yet i consider myself the most privileged of all
for when i see you
i see the world
and i see it the way it is
simply amazing! 
i see into the depth of your eyes
and behold the greatest magnificence
the most unprecedented grandeur
.  

you.

In the centre of my eye
.  

its you i see.
You are the world to me


He could've made two—
Another just like you.
But, then, He took 
A second thought, 
And said, 'Just one would do.'

And so, for your loveliness—
Your uniqueness too—
There is no other 
Quite like you.
There's just no other quite like you. 


I saw the cat
in my inner mind
fondling sweetly
the softest fur coat
I knew she was within me
ages past, when I was born on earth.

I saw the seed
of life sprouting 
in the rainwet earth
I could feel the growth
every morning my eyes explored
she has begun the journey to plant
I could feel the tree in a seed
and the seed was lying deep within.


I could feel the globe
the things of beauty
of love and loveliness
all encased within my heart
the flowering gardens
the silky grass
the snow capped peaks
the supple curves
the saintly caves
the silent innate contains 
what the vibrant outside exhibits


All the noisy flamboyant curses
reside in soft silent muses 
the statue is contained in the stone
magic is only in your magestic hone
the pen was before, 
the paper too
and the sky and ocean
birds and rains
yet, the poem is born
only from the microscopic within
when unseen angels bell the thing.. 

You ask how much I love you
And then you ask once more
And so my love I'll tell you now
As I did once before.


I love you more than flowers love
The rising of the sun
I love you more than horses love
The plains on which they run.

I love you more than eagles love
The currents way up high
I love you more than rainbows love
The droplets in the sky.

I love you more than fishes love
The sea in which they swim
I love you more than sea birds love
The waves on which they skim.

I love you more than moonbeams love
The planets as they turn
I love you more than starships love
The gases that they burn.

I love you more than Paris loved
Fair Helen when in Troy
I love you more than any girl
Has every loved a boy.

I love you more than Shakespeare loved
The muses in his verse
I love you more than rich old men
Love money in their purse.

I love you more than lollipops
I love you more than cheese
I even love you somewhat more than
Than honey made by bees! 

I love you more than yesterday, 
And every day before, 
But I think that when tomorrow comes
I'll love you even more.

I love you quite a lot you see
But this I must impress
I love you more than any words
Could ever help express.



You ask me, why, tho' ill at ease,
      Within this region I subsist,
      Whose spirits falter in the mist,
    And languish for the purple seas.
     It is the land that freemen till,
      That sober-suited Freedom chose,
      The land, where girt with friends or foes
    A man may speak the thing he will;
     A land of settled government,
     A land of just and old renown,
     Where Freedom slowly broadens down
   From precedent to precedent:

    Where faction seldom gathers head,
     But by degrees to fullness wrought,
     The strength of some diffusive thought
   Hath time and space to work and spread.

    Should banded unions persecute
     Opinion, and induce a time
     When single thought is civil crime,
   And individual freedom mute;

    Tho' Power should make from land to land
     The name of Britain trebly great--
     Tho' every channel of the State
   Should fill and choke with golden sand--

    Yet waft me from the harbour-mouth,
     Wild wind! I seek a warmer sky,
     And I will see before I die
   The palms and temples of the South. 


You asked me why
I'm not even going to try
You think its all about you
I can play that game to
You had to make up lies
I'm not going to cry
You did it once more
I'm not so sure
You can't have my heart
Not even one part


The splendor of the night, 
seduced, falls at the gait of your shape.
The beach holds to your footprints
to never forget a muse, everlasting affect.

This helpless wind do not hear, 
a loving whisper to a naked breeze.
In the sky hope, tenderness and adventure, 
a meeting to the moon, a walk on the waves.

Meanwhile, the sea feels impatience and despair, 
slowly caresses your existence
intermittent suffer, complete happiness.

You draw a little smile; 
nature stopped to think, only acts.
Decided to deeply love you, 
madly, gave its life. 


You bring out the Mexican in me.
The hunkered thick dark spiral.
The core of a heart howl.
The bitter bile.
The tequila lagrimas on Saturday all
through next weekend Sunday.
You are the one I'd let go the other loves for,
surrender my one-woman house.
Allow you red wine in bed,
even with my vintage lace linens.
Maybe. Maybe.


For you.

You bring out the Dolores del Rio in me.
The Mexican spitfire in me.
The raw navajas, glint and passion in me.
The raise Cain and dance with the rooster-footed devil in me.
The spangled sequin in me.
The eagle and serpent in me.
The mariachi trumpets of the blood in me.
The Aztec love of war in me.
The fierce obsidian of the tongue in me.
The berrinchuda, bien-cabrona in me.
The Pandora's curiosity in me.
The pre-Columbian death and destruction in me.
The rainforest disaster, nuclear threat in me.
The fear of fascists in me.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

You bring out the colonizer in me.
The holocaust of desire in me.
The Mexico City 'earthquake in me.
The Popocatepetl/Ixtaccihuatl in me.
The tidal wave of recession in me.
The Agustin Lara hopeless romantic in me.
The barbacoa taquitos on Sunday in me.
The cover the mirrors with cloth in me.


Sweet twin. My wicked other,
I am the memory that circles your bed nights,
that tugs you taut as moon tugs ocean.
I claim you all mine,
arrogant as Manifest Destiny.
I want to rattle and rent you in two.
I want to defile you and raise hell.
I want to pull out the kitchen knives,
dull and sharp, and whisk the air with crosses.
Me sacas lo mexicana en mi,
like it or not, honey.


You bring out the Uled-Nayl in me.
The stand-back-white-bitch-in me.
The switchblade in the boot in me.
The Acapulco cliff diver in me.
The Flecha Roja mountain disaster in me.
The dengue fever in me.
The ¡Alarma! murderess in me.
I could kill in the name of you and think
it worth it. Brandish a fork and terrorize rivals,
female and male, who loiter and look at you,
languid in you light. Oh,

I am evil. I am the filth goddess Tlazolteotl.
I am the swallower of sins.
The lust goddess without guilt.
The delicious debauchery. You bring out
the primordial exquisiteness in me.
The nasty obsession in me.
The corporal and venial sin in me.
The original transgression in me.


Red ocher. Yellow ocher. Indigo. Cochineal.
Pin. Copal. Sweetgrass. Myrrh.
All you saints, blessed and terrible,
Virgen de Guadalupe, diosa Coatlicue,
I invoke you.



Let
me show you. Love the only way I know how. 


You can trust me with your love
you can trust me with your heart
you can trust me with your life
but can you really trust me anyhow? 


You can love me 
as much as you can give yourself
i will allow you to love me with your  body
and your soul
but how much of that can you 
keep on giving me

you can feel me all you want
you can feel my vibes
you can feel me with your eyes closed
touch my lips and you can feel them
whispering your name, 
you must take your time 
take this slowly
we have time


you can worship me
you can adore me
you can absorb me
you can sing praises with me
but you can't control me with the words
you speak, if they aren't loving words

you just have to freely love me
you just have to be patient with me
let me love you, 
be free to come and go as i please
don't stop this love relationship
it will grow stronger day by day 
don't put demands on it
let me love you freely and spiritually
if you do that
i will give you all  of me
that special part 
then you will see
you can love me anyway, anyhow

You can be rude to me
So you can fall in love with me.


You can forget to smile
But I still love your style
Because I know deep inside
You are extraordinary and kind.

My classmates a long time ago
Used to utter these words as a motto: 
L'amour commence par la haine
(Love starts with hatred) 
Il n'y pas d'amour sans peine
(Love comes like a headache) 

You can be nasty to me
So you can fall in love with me.

When it is important, as long as you take my side
I will not stop loving your beautiful mind
You continue to amaze me
That's why I want you to be
My sweet honey.


I know that you have a fun personality
Underneath your exquisite beauty
That's why I still want you to be
My precious mermaid of the sea
And my honey bee.

No matter what, we will fall in love
And we will always float above
Do not be a pain in the neck of the hole
Let the bells ring, let the bells toll. 


As your cancer 
twists & snarls

biting into your soul

it gnaws away
at my name

the pain unable
to pronounce it

Until 
your dying day

I become simply


THAT PLACE CALLED DAY (for Fran)    

Later when I looked
for you

(you were gone)      

you had turned
into Time

your hair
turned into time

your tears
turned into Time

nothing I could hold
nothing I could touch

(love trying to hold
on to everything)      


as the winds of Time
.  

blew it all away.

I walked away
into that place

called
Day

(you know that place)      
between morning & night

that place
where you

no longer are
that place

that you have left

that place where you exist

only 
in my mind.



LEAVING IT ALL BEHIND (for Fran)   

She strips off
her body

right down
to her soul.

At last
she feels

whole. 


My brother comes home from work 
and climbs the stairs to our room. 
I can hear the bed groan and his shoes drop 
one by one. You can have it, he says. 

The moonlight streams in the window 
and his unshaven face is whitened 
like the face of the moon. He will sleep 
long after noon and waken to find me gone. 

Thirty years will pass before I remember 
that moment when suddenly I knew each man 
has one brother who dies when he sleeps 
and sleeps when he rises to face this life, 

and that together they are only one man 
sharing a heart that always labours, hands 
yellowed and cracked, a mouth that gasps 
for breath and asks, Am I gonna make it? 

All night at the ice plant he had fed 
the chute its silvery blocks, and then I 
stacked cases of orange soda for the children 
of Kentucky, one gray boxcar at a time 

with always two more waiting. We were twenty 
for such a short time and always in 
the wrong clothes, crusted with dirt 
and sweat. I think now we were never twenty.


In the city of Detroit, founded 
by de la Mothe Cadillac for the distant purposes 
of Henry Ford, no one wakened or died, 
no one walked the streets or stoked a furnace, 

for there was no such year, and now 
that year has fallen off all the old newspapers, 
calendars, doctors' appointments, bonds 
wedding certificates, drivers licenses. 

The city slept. The snow turned to ice. 
The ice to standing pools or rivers 
racing in the gutters. Then the bright grass rose 
between the thousands of cracked squares, 

and that grass died. I give you back  
I give you all the years from then 
to the coming one. Give me back the moon 
with its frail light falling across a face. 

Give me back my young brother, hard 
and furious, with wide shoulders and a curse 
all creation and say, You can have it.

I've gone from being alone to being at home
He's brought me to life if only he felt this right
He sends the rush to my pulse an electric to my heart. 
If Only he Knew how i felt deep inside.


I wounder when He kisses me what he thinks? ..
I wounder does He see what i see? ..


I may have my down days but he's always their
To drown the pain away.
Am always gunna care for him an always love him 
If we were ever torn apart my heart can never restart.


He's the better part of me
He's My best-friend, 
He's my everything if only he knew
how much he means to me.


No one realizes that he's always on my mind
an even when things get out of hand his
face always appears to fade it all out. 

When i Miss him i re-read over the things he 
says an i wounder am i the only one
who gets treated so good.


This Year has been hard an am glad

he's been there

hes made me stand when am prepared to fall

Hes been there when i can barely talk.


while everyone else has been walking in 

an out of my life he's the only one 

that stayed by my side.


ive always wounded what its like to love someone

 so much, now i feel it, it mustn't go. 



 I Never Wanna Be Without you. 

You chose to hold my hand and walk with me
Not because i was a perfect human being
Not because i had the perfect body shape
Not because i wore make up
Not because i cruised in a ship 
But because you understood humanity

You chose to check on me everyday
Not because you had no one else to check on
Not because your communication budget was large
Not because i was the best to communicate to and with
Not because it was an obligation 
But because you understood communication builds bridges

You chose to tell me that you cherished our friendship
Not because you had no friends before we met
Not because my company was the most important
Not because your friends were busy with other friends
Not because friendship is a necessity to the world 
But because of the value you placed on our friendship
 
You chose to tell me that you loved me
Not because you had never loved before
Not because you had no one else to love you back
Not because i was the most lovable person in the world 
But because you believed in loving me as a human being. 


Self stood apart
It stood witness
To an unusual union

The clouds
Didn't really move
We did! 

A sudden wave 
Of shyness overwhelmed
I hid behind a cloud! 

I didn't know 
You're there much before
I reached! 

Some chuckle heard 
From somewhere seeing us
Caught by each other! 

We played
Leaping from one cloud
To another

Hands clasped 
Thousands of feet
Above the earth! 

Leave us alone
Pleaded the two hearts 
In unison. 

Stranded amidst 
Scattered mounds of clouds
We floated



at some thousands of feet above the earth

You come to me quiet as rain not yet fallen
Afraid of how you might fail yourself your
dress seven summers old is kept open
in memory of sex, smells warm, of boys,
and of the once long grass.
But we are colder now; we have not
Love’s first magic here. You come to me
Quiet as bulbs not yet broken
Out into sunlight.


The fear I see in your now lining face
Changes to puzzlement when my hands reach
For you as branches reach. Your dress
Does not fall easily, nor does your body
Sing of it won accord. What love added to
A common shape no longer seems a miracle.
You come to me with your age wrapped in excuses
And afraid of its silence.

Into the paradise our younger lives made of this bed and room
Has leaked the world and all its questioning
and now those shapes terrify us most
that remind us of our own. Easier now
to check longings and sentiment,
to pretend not to care overmuch,
you look out across the years, and you come to me
quiet as the last of our senses closing. 


Once I thought
Lack of communication
From you to me
Ravaged my insides
As if raped
Several times over

Now that I know
How good you can be
At your communication
It plunders me
My insides
Worse than a repeated rape


You could have been an ant.
I could have been an anteater.
You could have been rain.
I could have been a lick of salt.
But we are blessed here and now
to be human beings, alive in rare ways
that we often take for granted.

See, I can rise from a depth of awareness
to express this to you 
and you can listen and 
understand me
because of our preciousness
as human beings. 


You are one of the rarest forms of life
to ever walk the earth.
This realization ushers us
Into  grateful living.


Love what you love now.

Grateful and awake
ask what you need to know now
in prayer on your kneels humbly. 

You, darkness, that I come from
I love you more than all the fires
that fence in the world, 
for the fire makes a circle of light for everyone
and then no one outside learns of you. 

But the darkness pulls in everything-
shapes and fires, animals and myself, 
how easily it gathers them! -
powers and people-

and it is possible a great presence is moving near me. 

I have faith in nights. 


Bleeding away all my pain
You couldn't save me now
I am way to far gone
You weren't there for so long
Now that you want to care
It's just to late for sorry
You didn't care before
why start now and waist my time? 
I always cryed over you
Now its your trun to cry over me
I don't haev to be the one with a broken heart
Now its your trun to feel what I did for so long
I want to say goodbye and be nice 
But then i just don't how you really feel right now


You do not know me well, the Love Poetess! 
I'm a poet and devotee of goddess.
Please drive away jealousy from your mind
And try to think of good thing every time.

No one will respect you for your vices.
Kindly be honest to be a poetess
And try to love human - humanity.
Rear virtues - Love, kindness and honesty.

Why do you stealthily search me at night? 
If you want respect from others and me

Work like a true poet and respect others.
The whole world will admire you forever.


from breakfast to madness. Late August,
I speed through the antiseptic tunnel
where the moving dead still talk
of pushing their bones against the thrust
or the laughing bee on a stalk

of death. We stand in broken
lines and wait while they unlock
the doors and count us at the frozen gates
of dinner. The shibboleth is spoken
and we move to gravy in our smock
of smiles. We chew in rows, our plates
scratch and whine like chalk

in school. There are no knives
for cutting your throat. I make
moccasins all morning. At first my hands
kept empty, unraveled for the lives
they used to work. Now I learn to take
them back, each angry finger that demands
I mend what another will break

tomorrow. Of course, I love you;
you lean above the plastic sky,
god of our block, prince of all the foxes.
The breaking crowns are new
that Jack wore.
Your third eye
moves among us and lights the separate boxes
where we sleep or cry.


What large children we are
here. All over I grow most tall
in the best ward. Your business is people,
you call at the madhouse, an oracular
eye in our nest. Out in the hall
the intercom pages you. You twist in the pull
of the foxy children who fall

like floods of life in frost.
And we are magic talking to itself,
forgotten. Am I still lost?
Once I was beautiful. Now I am myself,
counting this row and that row of moccasins
waiting on the silent shelf. 

You don't believe -- I won't attempt to make ye:
You are asleep -- I won't attempt to wake ye.
Sleep on! sleep on! while in your pleasant dreams
Of Reason you may drink of Life's clear streams.
Reason and Newton, they are quite two things;
For so the swallow and the sparrow sings.

Reason says `Miracle': Newton says `Doubt.'
Aye! that's the way to make all Nature out.
`Doubt, doubt, and don't believe without experiment':
When He said `Only believe! believe and try!
Try, try, and never mind the reason why!


'IT'S LIKE YOU'VE MOVED ON
 I'M STILL STARING AT YOUR PICS IN PHONE
IT'S LIKE YOU JUST DON'T CARE
(ABOUT ME) 
IF I STILL DRINK AND SMOKE
YOU KNOW I WAS A HARD MAN TO FALL IN LOVE
BUT YOU CAME AROUND ME
YOU HYPNOTIZED ME
YOU MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WASN'T ALIVE
BEFORE YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE YEAH 

NOW YOU DON'T CARE IF I
IF I COME HOME LATE NIGHT
NO, YOU DON'T CARE IF I
IF I HANG OUT WITH OTHER GIRLS
YOU DON'T CARE
OH NO YOU JUST DON'T GIVE A DAMN
THINGS HAVE CHANGED
YOU DON'T CAREYou Don't Know What Love Is
but you know how to raise it in me
like a dead girl winched up from a river. How to
wash off the sludge, the stench of our past.
How to start clean. This love even sits up
and blinks; amazed, she takes a few shaky steps.
Any day now she'll try to eat solid food. She'll want
to get into a fast car, one low to the ground, and drive
to some cinderblock shithole in the desert
where she can drink and get sick and then
dance in nothing but her underwear. You know
where she's headed, you know she'll wake up 
with an ache she can't locate and no money
and a terrible thirst. So to hell
with your warm hands sliding inside my shirt
and your tongue down my throat
like an oxygen tube. Cover me
in black plastic. Let the mourners through. 


I didn't get to see her
Even for the very last time
I was too late, I was too slow
And now she is gone
She is no more

I wish I could turn the clock
And see her more often as I could
But regrets are all I have in me
But if I can change things, I would

I should have seen the signs
I should have been more loving
I should have been more kind
Because I had no other, but her

No tears are pouring down my cheek
It's pointless
It won't bring her back to me
I can't cry enough inside
All I can do is pray for her journey

Let her be amongst the good
Forgive her sins, I pray for 
Walkin' down the street, come to school today
All rain, no shine, all work, no play

Not a single sec to talk to friends
All work, no play until the end

I gotta find a way to get outta here
Too many deadlines looming near-

~Chorus~ 
I can't go on
The pain's too strong
I'm givin' up the fight

You wouldn't know
Too hard to show
Cuz you don't live my life
~
Oh, it's eating away at me inside
No place to run, no place to hide

Can't turn away, just can't strike out
Can't shield myself, can't give a shout

You wouldn't understand cuz you don't know
What it feels like to be laid low-


~Chorus~
I can't go on
The pain's too strong
I'm givin' up the fight

You wouldn't know
Too hard to show
Cuz you don't live my life.  

grab my heart
rip it out
tear it to shreds
until i realize
you dont care


You
can do
 anything.
You
 really
 want to do.

I
 Believe
 this is true.
Why
 won’t you
 even try? 

Too 
afraid
 you will fail.
If
you do
 try again.

Some
 must win, 
some must lose.
Take
 a chance
join the dance

You
 must choose
 to move on
Or
 remain
 as you are.

Up
 to you.
 Which you do.
No
 complaints 
listened to. 


You fight and fight 
Likes  its alright
She sits there and watchs close
Somethimes she wish she were a ghost
Can't you see that it hurts her
To hear you screaming
Look what you made her do
She put that tiny cut just to show you
Take it from me its not ok
When your kid has to say
Mom and dad please stop
Its not fair for us to have to hear
If your not happy then go away 
Leave us all here to just be


You fit into me
like a hook into an eye

a fish hook
an open eye


You walk up from the river
you float down my eyes― 

do what you like, white strap-lines
on the clove shade of your shoulders.


The moon comes up on
the burnt-looking horizon, 
 
you walk up from the river, 
a river of yourself― you float
down my eyes.

I stare over the split 
stone cliff, the donkey standing
on the olive-shaded hill-it's all

the same― you float 
down my eyes― I look away― 
you float down my eyes.

Do what you like, 
on the hillside of oregano, 
in the field of short sunflowers, 

the slow look on your face, 
the slow wind moving 
the blue dust down the fig skins, 

do what you like― you don't know
how good you are, twin hills of moss
your eyes come near, out of sleep, 

you don't know, you lay your head 
back on the bedroll
and look up at me like
we've been together
for twenty years― I take 
the towel away from your body, 

your clove shade― you
float down my eyes― I drag 
your throat slow with my hair, 
the shadows make the pine needles

look soft, split stone cliff, 
the slow waves softening 
the light below them, 
the river giving up
what it owns to the sea. 

Tis the plan for each
One of us therein are all
Our special places


You go, my love.  

you go-
And I will carry on waiting for you, 
As I always do: 
Looking for your face
In every season and passage of time, 
In sunrise, your smile; 
In every sunset, the impalpable kiss —
My sea, thirsty of your sunbeam lips; 
I will meet you in the moonlight, 
In nights with starry skies: 
You go, my love.  

you go-
And I will carry on without you, 
Without my heart
For it belongs to you: 
You go, my love



you go-You got my sister pregnant and refused to take responsibility.
You told her it's her problem and now you have to deal with me.
Let's step outside and deal with this like men.
When I get done, you won't shirk your responsibility again.
You told her to have an abortion even after she decided to have the child.
Now I'm pissed off and I'm about to go wild.
You refused to marry my sister but you will pay child support.
Or I'll beat the hell out of you and then take you to court.
Take my word when I tell you that it's wise not to mess with me.
I weigh nearly two hundred pounds and I stand six feet three. 


You had made me rain, 
In a solitary emptiness; 
Left me in lonely. 


Never just some walk to the pools or to where 
the petals burst. You know how I wrote 
to you once: protect the body within the body 
of little blood-contained blossoms               
I feared was torn-up 
in your life away from me? 
I could've written that to myself only, 
and probably settled for the worst.  
For me the way was always intricate, 
hard, never transparent. About that, 
soon after we met, you said, 'I know. '
And I'm repeating this, my usual
redundancy, or is it your
absent-mindedness I respond to? 
since for three days I've been 
silently blamed for leaving unsaid or not 
warning about in some way 
or soon enough what I've already 
mentioned here. It has been remnants
of clarity, fragments of precision. 
I too want things uncluttered, 
stripped down, bare in the sense 
that any detail resisted
is a set-back. 
And don't think I don't know
I haven't been able to 
remove a lot of the nettles 
from what I'm deprived 
of seeing, necessarily, without you.  
And what do I see? 
Not that much. And then
we don't know if I do see more 
if it'll be an improvement. 


I want to forget you
But you drive me
You appeal for an urge
Then why you don't remember me
I feel sometimes
You want to forget me
You have forgot me.

How shall I forget you
You are my breath
You are my senses
But you avoid me
You drown me, because
You want to forget me
You have forgot me.

Have you forgot all
All days and promises
You always break promises
You always swear and kill me
How many times will you kill
You like to forget me
You have forgot me.

You tell I have cheated
You rewind the same, that
I couldn't make you mine
You always remember to rewind
But never want to read my mind
You make me to think that
You have forgot me.


You can't forget me
I am not weak
Not as much as you think
I have the strength to awake you
You can't avoid me
You may only want to forget
You have forgot me.

Listen jaanu
How shall I forget you
You are my source for breathing
How can you  forget me
You too have loved me
Then why you forget me
Why you want to forget me.


You can never forget me
Nor I can forget you
But your silence say
You have forgot me. 

You gave me your heart
I tore it apart
You gave me a life
I slit with a knife

When I realized what I had
You were far beyond sad
I tried to make up
It was already corrupt

Now I've done it again
This repetitive sin

My love grows so strong
But now it is wrong
Your love I can't regain
For I've caused too much pain

Now all I can say
Is I hope for a day
Where you find the one
Your search will be done

I will never release
This love that brings peace
So long as I live
My heart I will give


Mom I love you 
Yes I know you love me to
But mom I'm a big girl now
You have to understand how
I'm going to be just fine
Mom I'm not nine
Yes its hard for you to grasp that I am older
But mom always remember
i learnd all from you
maybe somethings form dad toyou think that one sorry can make things better
you think that guilt can make things better
you think that years of not talking to me can be fixed by one sorry
i'm your daughter your sopostoo love me
your soposto care about me
and love me
but i don't love you any more
you wasted my time with empty promises
like i want to be there for you
i want to have a real life with you
i can and never will forgive you for ignoring me for four years
you are the worst fauther ever
you tryed to kill me when i was it my mothers stomach
you beat me 
and your stupid wife locked me in my room for a day without anything
you said you loved me
i dont believe you
you wrecked my life now stay out for good


Making the best of what we had
Was our first deal. Pity it was not
Enough. Just a
Pre-destined route.

Our place is now deserted. Wretched
Like an unfinished song. It's the same
For both of us.

Whom do you belong to? 
And I? You and I were together
At the beginning, when that
Song began. Will we be
Together at its end? 

If not, there will always be
The memory; 
Inextinguishable maybe
As long as we're alive —You
And/or I

And nothing else.





I'm the person in the corner
I sit by myself, and no one cares.

You know me, you see me
I'm the person you drive by
I'm all alone on the street side
holding a sign, and no one cares. 

You know me, you see me
I'm the person that you shut  your door
to near the holiday's, and no one cares.

You know me, you see me
But i bet you didn't know all i need 
is a warm place to slept and a little food. 
I need family to love me. I lost my family when i 
was in the war, and no one cares. 


You know the place: then 
Leave Crete and come to us 
waiting where the grove is 
pleasantest, by precincts 
 
sacred to you; incense 
smokes on the altar, cold 
streams murmur through the 
 
apple branches, a young 
rose thicket shades the ground 
and quivering leaves pour 
 
down deep sleep; in meadows 
where horses have grown sleek 
among spring flowers, dill 
 
Fill our gold cups with love 
stirred into clear nectar


I’VE noticed this happen, when everything is black,
When I’m down below zero and cannot get back,
When I feel like a sort of a National Debt,
That will go on for ages and never be met,
When my will is all bagged at the knees and dead beat,
It is then, don’t you know, that., I’m certain to meet
With some prodigal lifeless dejected old bean,
Who is worse off than I you know what I mean. 
Someone or other who’s entered the race,
With a sense of intention but can’t stay the pace,
He tells all his troubles and heaven knows what,
Talks about Fate and all that sort of rot,
And it makes all my own little troubles look small,
Till I find I’ve no cause to be worried at all,
And it doesn’t seem cricket to grouse when I’ve seen,
That he’s worse off than I you know what I mean. 

No matter how hard one may fall down the hill,
There’s always a somebody lower down still,
And it makes you feel well, it seems mean to repeat,
All your own little troubles to people you meet.
One learns in the end, that self pity’s a curse,
And to talk of your cares only makes them seem worse.
It takes courage to stand where it’s easy to lean,
But it makes you feel better you know what I mean. 

The chap we all like is the chap who can smile,
Though his heart may be breaking with sorrow the while,
He just keeps them all secretly locked in his breast,
Keep’s the worm to himself, gives the world of his best.
He has losses like we have, yet never gives in,
But goes silently back to his task with a grin.
And the lesson we learn from this priceless old being,
Is to smile all the while with some laughs in between.
Though you’re empty and broke, meet your fate with a joke,
For the sake of the folk who can’t see what you mean
And it may be in turn even they will yet learn,
And they’ll smile all the while when they see what you mean.
Do you get me? Ah well that’s what I mean. 


Something makes me sad
Something makes me mad
Something makes me glad
You're not aroun'
'Cause you let me down

Wishing you were here
Wishing you were near
Wishing you were clear
But you confoun'
'Cause you let me down

Now that I am blue
Now that we are through
Now that he's with you
I hope you frown
'Cause you let me down

You have gone away
You have made his day
You have lost your way
Your sin aboun'
'Cause it's him you foun'






Shining so bright I can hardly see
The sunlight because of thee

When springs wakens nature with a sigh
When fluffy clouds go sailing by
Summer comes on, with it's moonlight nights
You, my knight, will beckon to me with sweet delights.

Autumn and winter won't be so chill
Winter evenings with you I'll kill
I'll sit beside you, you'll be my guide
And thus through our lives we shall happily abide! 


You'll find—it when you try to die—
The Easier to let go—
For recollecting such as went—
You could not spare—you know.

And though their places somewhat filled—
As did their Marble names
With Moss—they never grew so full—
You chose the newer names—

And when this World—sets further back—
As Dying—say it does—
The former love—distincter grows—
And supersedes the fresh—

And Thought of them—so fair invites—
It looks too tawdry Grace
To stay behind—with just the Toys
We bought—to ease their place—You'll know Her—by Her Foot—
The smallest Gamboge Hand
With Fingers—where the Toes should be—
Would more affront the Sand—

Than this Quaint Creature's Boot—
Adjusted by a Stern—
Without a Button—I could vouch—
Unto a Velvet Limb—

You'll know Her—by Her Vest—
Tight fitting—Orange—Brown—
Inside a Jacket duller—
She wore when she was born—

Her Cap is small—and snug—
Constructed for the Winds—
She'd pass for Barehead—short way off—
But as She Closer stands—

So finer 'tis than Wool—
You cannot feel the Seam—
Nor is it Clasped unto of Band—
Nor held upon—of Brim—

You'll know Her—by Her Voice—
At first—a doubtful Tone—
A sweet endeavor—but as March
To April—hurries on—

She squanders on your Ear
Such Arguments of Pearl—
You beg the Robin in your Brain
To keep the other—still—


You'll know it—as you know 'tis Noon—
By Glory—
As you do the Sun—
By Glory—
As you will in Heaven—

By intuition, Mightiest Things
Assert themselves—and not by terms—
"I'm Midnight"—need the Midnight say—
"I'm Sunrise"—Need the Majesty?

Omnipotence—had not a Tongue—
His listp—is Lightning—and the Sun—
His Conversation—with the Sea—
"How shall you know"?
Consult your Eye


You'll live, but I'll not; perhaps,
The final turn is that.
Oh, how strongly grabs us
The secret plot of fate.

They differently shot us:
Each creature has its lot,
Each has its order, robust, --
A wolf is always shot.

In freedom, wolves are grown,
But deal with them is short:
In grass, in ice, in snow, --
A wolf is always shot.

Don't cry, oh, friend my dear,
If, in the hot or cold,
From tracks of wolves, you'll hear
My desperate recall. 

If there were
an award for
'most impressive
in the jacuzzi'
you would lose.

I don't even own
a jacuzzi. 


You lure me into this web with all your lies
You’re beautiful- you’re smart
Well, those lies just break my heart
Kill from the inside, 
Watch me fall gracefully, 
And my tears are badges of bravery
To cry in front of your face
To cry and you call me pathetic a waste
Bury me with you labels
Cut me with your sighs
Fatal betrayal of lost words, 
And simple smiles
Fearless our generation will die
Grab my hands squeeze them tight
Look into my eyes
See my soul 
Kiss me goodnight
I hate the way every moment your name is in my head
I hate how every second I hear your voice
"Hey baby, yea babe, of course babe-"
Replaying conversations when we just laid deep into our sheets
Thinking of how you would laugh at how I was just being silly
Into a magical dismay 
I check my messages twice
As if I didn’t hear you didn’t call the first time
I read old convos as if I forgot what we would say
I smile lightly as you linger into my mind
My heart is racing like we were meant to stop time
Speed of light is this dream
And I know when I come awake
You’ll be thinking how we could have meant so much more
More than just stupid words, 
More than tears up on the floor
We were meant to walk through double doors
Say sweet vows and kiss at the moment of being bride and groom
But, with all these lies, you left no room
To ever be happy I would have to close my eyes
And pretend you love me
Pretend we were meant, 
But, a life time of pretending can surely make me forget
There are others who can love me
Others who don’t cause me to fall into shame
Baby, I’m just so tired of how you blame
This end is like check mate
Sorry dear, you lost the game


You Love Me
 
Tell me you love me my sweet, 
I am kind and you are always  
on my mind, 
from Paris to California  
your words always have away to 
quiet my mind, 
my heart you put love and joy 
the war of the darken night I 
have a hard time sleeping at night  
Without you by my side, 
true love you are my sweet I chase 
you in a loving way, 
I write you a note to tell you how I feel, 
with a stronger faith I embrace 
the love you give with your words I hold, 
a sword, a horse, 
a shield my Knight Shinning Armor  
Is what he reveals,  
this inconstancy in such an loving way  
as you too shall adore me even by far 
I could love you even as far, 
my sweet you hold the key to my heart. 


sorry for the title
sorry for being me 
sorry for living 
sorry for being dumb and an idiot 
shall I lay the iron on my arm and after that 
I lay me next to the worms in a wooden box


Under Your spell make me feel special, 
Share my doubts, remove all my fears 
When you smile I fall under your spell, 
You wipe away so many of my tears.


I chase the taste of your lips into the night, 
In the moonlight I find bliss securely waiting, 
I reach the stars to see the breaking light, 
It feels like the sun will never grow dim.

Together we are together connected, 
Beyond the prism that friendship has define, 
Things we love others may have rejected, 
But our love will last for a very long time. 

I believe strength can wash away the pain, 
You make me forget the sadness for a while 
And we can walk together through the rain, 
Under your spell love makes me feel special.

Under a spell and make me feel special 
Taking the time to say something enchanting, 
Then take me to the place of your smile, 
You make me feel I was worth something. 


Dad, you make me so mad
You make me feel so bad
I have had a perfect summer
Got grounded
What a bummer
You make me feel lost
Look what one mistake cost
Me being punished until whenever
That's not fair
But you don 't care


You may forget but 
let me tell you 
this: someone in 
some future time 
will think of us


Quills and pigments, 
Sharp nails and dried leaves, 
Dark chillness and hot wind, 
Thousands of pages sustain, 
Time tested newly born readers, 
Blow the young breeze in their hearts, 
Extracting flowing tears from their wells, 
The river of metaphors still flow, 
In each and every individuals, 
Who call themselves as the writers and the fans, 
Thousands of years have to arrive, 
To celebrate the preserved materials, 
From the past, what a great thinkers they are, 
Staying in the hearts of many generations, 
The wealth didn’t make it viable, 
To last for millennium in the minds, 
The literature of all languages, 
Still young to adore the youngsters, 
With well debated thoughts, 
Those are contemporary, never grow old.
you may be one of them dear friend. 


You meaner beauties of the night,
That poorly satisfy our eyes
More by your number than your light;
You common people of the skies,
What are you when the sun shall rise?

You curious chanters of the wood,
That warble forth Dame Nature's lays,
Thinking your voices understood
By your weak accents; what's your praise
When Philomel her voice shall raise?

You violets that first appear,
By your pure purple mantles known,
Like the proud virgins of the year,
As if the spring were all your own;
What are you when the rose is blown?

So, when my mistress shall be seen
In form and beauty of her mind,
Tell me, if she were not design'd
Th' eclipse and glory of her kind?


   Silly, you men-so very adept
at wrongly faulting womankind,
not seeing you're alone to blame
for faults you plant in woman's mind.

   After you've won by urgent plea
the right to tarnish her good name,
you still expect her to behave--
you, that coaxed her into shame.

   You batter her resistance down
and then, all righteousness, proclaim
that feminine frivolity,
not your persistence, is to blame.

   When it comes to bravely posturing,
your witlessness must take the prize:
you're the child that makes a bogeyman,
and then recoils in fear and cries.

   Presumptuous beyond belief,
you'd have the woman you pursue
be Thais when you're courting her,
Lucretia once she falls to you.

   For plain default of common sense,
could any action be so queer
as oneself to cloud the mirror,
then complain that it's not clear?

   Whether you're favored or disdained,
nothing can leave you satisfied.
You whimper if you're turned away,
you sneer if you've been gratified.

   With you, no woman can hope to score;
whichever way, she's bound to lose;
spurning you, she's ungrateful--
succumbing, you call her lewd.

   Your folly is always the same:
you apply a single rule
to the one you accuse of looseness
and the one you brand as cruel.

   What happy mean could there be
for the woman who catches your eye,
if, unresponsive, she offends,
yet whose complaisance you decry?

   Still, whether it's torment or anger--
and both ways you've yourselves to blame--
no matter how loud you complain.

   It's your persistent entreaties
that change her from timid to bold.
Having made her thereby naughty,
you would have her good as gold.

   So where does the greater guilt lie
for a passion that should not be:
with the man who pleads out of baseness
or the woman debased by his plea?

   Or which is more to be blamed--
though both will have cause for chagrin:
the woman who sins for money
or the man who pays money to sin?

   So why are you men all so stunned
at the thought you're all guilty alike?
Either like them for what you've made them
or make of them what you can like.

   If you'd give up pursuing them,
you'd discover, without a doubt,
you've a stronger case to make
against those who seek you out.

   I well know what powerful arms
you wield in pressing for evil:
your arrogance is allied
with the world, the flesh, and the devil


You’re more than just a friend, you’re my motivation.
When everyone turns their back on me you’re there.
When I’m overwhelmed with fear and hurt you’re near, still so far away.
You makes me smile through all the hardships.
You kindles the fire in me.	
You have a heart that conveys love. 
You care for others, that’s beauty to me.
You give me you time, you make me feel happy.
I cry tears of joy to know you’re my friend.
More than just a friend! 
I can overcome the world with you on my side.
Together we can do anything.
I like the fact that you value yourself, 
You thought me that.
You got dreams and ambitions.
That’s awesome! 
You make me scream with passion, 
You bring joy to my soul.
And, that’s exactly what I need from a friend.
Let’s see where friendship take us.
You mean a lot to me- 


DON'T MURDER ME. 

you must become a kingdom that dissolves
whose diamond walls must one day
all come down

but until then. make a
map of another world
with rooms of endless amber
reconceptions-

and pray the ink
does not take
long to dry-


Do not allow me
Even a moment
Of freedom from
The net they cast
To trap me
You sitting pretty making
My fragile glass-heart
Your permanent abode
Watch the show   
Like an engrossed spectator
At an open air theatre

Actor-emotions drain me
To the last dropp of my energies


You entered in my life, 
As a soft spoken person, 
With fantastic poems. 
Slowly and slowly, 
I found that your, 
Each poems comes, 
Especially at least one 
Word you have picked up
Made me think as, 
And as the days went by 
My curiosity to find you out 
Was got increased
Then some of your poems
Did irritate me 
You really killed me. 
Then some rubbish comments made
In your blogs by someone 
Really irritated me 
Because I felt it taunted me. 
Really it was a terrific week for me 
In frustration I posted 
The poem How could you? 
Immediately one poem came as 
a reply
I just sat down 
What to do next 
Deleted it 
Still frustration was mounting on
In my mind 
Then I got an idea 
I took a word Chameleon 
From your poem Neelu 
Then again took a few more words
From your poem 
Finally posted it 
Just free myself
Again I felt its not reaching you 
Then deleted it. 
I dont know 
I have read many suspense novel 
So my brain too wonders like that 
If anything had struck 
Like poems, words, or suspicious in anything 
Then that one will be targeted. 
I have been behind your poems 
When I felt something Fishy! 
It made me relaxed to 
Know a female voice played it very well. 
You really reeled my head.  
I bow to you.. 


It was all here at one time
Eveything was greatest as it can get
My heart was whole back then
Now the biggest part is gone! 
My life will neve be the same
He took that away from me! 
No once can save me not now
My life is to far gone
As I become something all fear
I lost all hope when you took her away


Your eyes
intent on the hunt

track down words
from page to page.

A slender hand
holds the book

against a pair
of naked knees.

A nipple
caught in the crock

of an arm
made brown by the sun

(totally uninterested
in the book at hand)  

stiffens as it
catches my gaze.


Looks at me pleadingly
begging me: "Please.  

oh.  

please! "

How can I
possibly
resist it.

Tantalised & titillated
by your right tit

perched like an exotic
morsel in the V of your arm.


I, bit by bit
(yes.  

I admit it)  


give in
to it.

Place it between
lips & teeth

cajole
it
&
ahhhhhhh

the gift of tongues

translating my desire
into your need

until now you no longer
read. 


It  is you who are painfully 
parting the fibres of my being
to penetrate the marrow
of my substance. 

In the moments of darkness
help me to know this.

Enlivened by the power of the Spirit, 
I keep moving, although the pace is slow, 
moving through the dark, 
fuelled by hope. 


You Plagiarized Me
My soul struggles 
without true Love 
I walk into the dark 
I feel so alone 
while my spirit slowly dies 
Oh, how this makes me cry 
what about me
will I ever be enough 
will my words ever matter 
I will walk around like a lost clown 
but I will never give in to this evil 
that is always at my mind 
day and night 
Oh, how I cry to feel your love again 
without all this sin 
Oh, do I matter 
do you even care what it is I fear 
you just walk around me in the dark
to keep me on the edge 
like you are waiting for me to be dead 
I am lost deep into the sea 
within darken dreams 
desperate cries of all times 
haunt over me like a darken cloud
my mind is unfolding 
to a time when Love was once with me
how could this be 
when I feel so lonely 
I have no nourishment for my spirit to feed
I feel so empty and weak 
look what you are doing to me 
why can't you see 
Look at me 
taste this cold bitterness 
you had given to me 
My soul struggles to keep hanging on 
I am at my end of the grave 
my life is only a mystery of broken dreams 
of you and me 
You plagiarized me.





You played and sang a snatch of song,
A song that all-too well we knew;
But whither had flown the ancient wrong;
And was it really I and you?
O, since the end of life's to live
And pay in pence the common debt,
What should it cost us to forgive
Whose daily task is to forget?

You babbled in the well-known voice -
Not new, not new the words you said.
You touched me off that famous poise,
That old effect, of neck and head.
Dear, was it really you and I?
In truth the riddle's ill to read,
So many are the deaths we die
Before we can be dead indeed. 


Poetry
Has no 
Time sense! 

It happens
At most
Unthought of
Hour and place

Like that 
Flush of desire
For you
Overwhelms me
At all odd and
Unexpected hours


When you can’t find me near you
Look deep inside your heart’s horizon
And I’ll be smiling down at you
With the vibrant colours of the rainbow
The skies may look too dark and gray
And the world a little bit out of place
Your happiness may not be assured
Yet, I want you to know that I’m close
I could never get too far away from you
I’m in the deepest ends of your heart
As you are always, here in my heart
The nights may get colder and lonely
And your fears may make you worry
Still, I will never trade your place
You’ll always be my first and last
I could never do without you my love
‘Cos you becloud my sweetest thoughts
And you’re always safe herein my heart


You're Always On My Mind

You're always on my mind
most of the time 
day and night
you're never hard to find
when it comes to dreams 
I never want to take you for granted
I just want to keep your love close 
Your love is what kept me going
I know I will always need you in my life.



You're certainly a genuine poetess
With a generous heart and a true mind. 
Your world must be filled with joy and happiness 
You're the lover of beauty and mankind. 

Every time your words and kindness charm me  
Nobody can trample your tender heart 
As it's filled with child like simplicity. 
The plants of beauty will grow on your earth. 

I have never met you my dear madam 
But in the sky of my heart you're the moon.
Though recently you have known who I am, 
You have made me a popular poet soon.

You're the source of my creative power.
I will remember you till my last hour. 


h October,( m) . 


It hurts me
To come to
You
For there're
So many
Others
Who come
To you

You're Mine

With others
I cannot
Share you


I live in that 
Seemingly
Misapprehended
Solitude, 
I live in my memory
Trying to leave back things of the past.
I'm a green wave
Tired of losing.
You're my final wave, 
A little more tunefully
In a dancing sea
In this bliss of life
Like a weedy sea dragon
Walking in sounds
For keeping this endless love, 
Nothing else. 


You're not alone my sweet one because I am always 
thinking of you and right by your side.
I love you so much and care for you dear
I won't leave you all alone to face this world by yourself.
You are so treasured and diamond I cherish
I'll never leave you my precious Kira.
I love you sweet lady and will always stick by you
I just want to be with you forever and ever.


You're not alone I swear to you my only lady
just feel me beside you and holding you closely, 
my heart calls as it reaches to tell you 
that you are amazing and I just feel such tenderness
for my most beautiful lady.
You're not alone I swear my sweet Angel because
you are my sweetie and I adore you completely.
Kira I love you and just want to be with you sweet one
and I would never abandon my sweet one.
You are my everything and most beloved Angel
and I am beside you always my gorgeous one.

I love you sweet Kira and am always beside you
giving you sweet kisses of deep reassurance, 
I'm always holding you because I so truly love you
and I am right here whenever needed.
I so truly love you and I treasure you baby
and I just want to spend eternity with
my only true love.
Kira you are amazing so just hear my hearts call
as it tells you I love you and want to hold you forever.
You are my best friend and only true love 
and I'm in want of no other ever sweet one. 


You're not my lover, 
You're a sign of sins for me, 
In my existence.You're right—"the way is narrow"—
And "difficult the Gate"—
And "few there be"—Correct again—
That "enter in—thereat"—

'Tis Costly—So are purples!
'Tis just the price of Breath—
With but the "Discount" of the Grave—
Termed by the Brokers—"Death"!


And after that—there's Heaven—
The Good Man's—"Dividend"—
And Bad Men—"go to Jail"—
I guess—You're safe with me sweet lady. 
I'm here to protect and show how truly, 
deeply, and with pure sincerity I love you. 
I'll never leave you hurting filled with doubt. 


I have made many mistakes in the past, 
yet I'm working hard and I will prove 
to you in all I do that I'm changing to 
always be the best man I can for you. 

You're safe with me because I will 
go beyond all my limits to keep you safe. 
Make sure you always feel warmth and comfort 
in my loving soul to you I dedicate. 
I'll make sure you always have all the love 
and care you so deeply need. 
And if anyone ever hurts you 
they'll pay the steepest fee. 



I just want to pour out and show you 
all the things I hold within my heart. 
So please just come and let me wrap you up 
within my loving, caring, and needing arms. 

Feel my love and warmth, 
and if you need to laugh or cry from the 
emotions and thoughts you hold inside, 
I'll stay right there holding you dear until 
you feel it all has passed. 
I'm not leaving you because you were 
my first love and still are my only one. 



I would rather be tortured and die than hurt you. 
I will give all my life for you to be my wife, 
and I will always strive to provide you with 
the greatest gifts and riches 
which this world provides. 
Love and dedication, faithful to my partner, 
being there to help and serve from my hearts 
deep desire and devotion. 
and feel her worth as my Angel here on earth. 



literally everything I see and so much more. 


You're so truly beautiful in every way there is.
I deeply treasure you in full my dear 
because you mean so much to me.
You're everything a man could ever want
and everything I will ever need.
Kira you are beautiful and the Angel 

You're so very beautiful you captured
my heart right at the very start.
I knew your heart was pure
as your soul shone through so very bright, 
you've always made me feel so good
and smile because you're so full of light.
Kira you are beautiful and I love you more
each passing day and night.
No matter what you think you are beautiful
and I know that you are a special soul

Others have mistreated you
and taken you for granted, 
I want to help you see past them
and remember all your worth.
You are such a precious soul
and woman so very bright and beautiful
I want to spend all time and space
hand in hand right by your side.
I love you Kira because in every way
inside and out you are beautiful
and I treasure that.
You're so beautiful without a single doubt.

You're so very beautiful and I see all the good, 
I want to be with you and celebrate our lives.
There is no other soul I want to spend my time, 
you are the special one I give myself
because I trust you in your good.
I know you love me just as much 
and treasure me as well.
I'm not a handsome man but you love me as I am, 
I'm so grateful for you my beautiful girl
and I love you complete and full.
I know you are the one for me because
my heart can see all your good and feels you're pure.
Kira you are beautiful and I love you
my sweet Angel dove. 

Kira you're so very beautiful
and I truly adore you.
When I see you I know I am
without a single doubt looking upon an Angel.
You are so very beautiful and you
don't even know it and I want to 
help you see it because you truly
are gorgeous to me and a beautiful woman
with a big heart and has so very much to give the world.
Kira you are so beautiful and I adore you
through and through to my very core.

Kira my dear you are the most beautiful woman
to me that's ever existed in history.
A natural beauty that needs no aids, 
you don't mess it up with make up
and I am so thankful for that because
it would ruin perfection and I would hate that.
You are so beautiful and anyone who's
told you different is a mean jerk who's
only ambitions were to hurt, 
you are beautiful my dear and that's 
just one of the many reasons I love you so much.

Kira you are so very very beautiful both
inside and out and I just want to hold 
you so close and tell you I love you sweet one, 
I want to tell you you're beautiful
then give you a kiss, 
I want to look in your eyes so you can
see the truth of my words in my soul
and know everything is true and real.
You are so beautiful and I want you to know
I'll always stick by you my sweet Angel dove.
You are so beautiful in heart, mind, body, 
and your precious soul and I treasure you my dear
and I love you so much my sweet diamond in the rough. 

Sweet one you truly are so beautiful, 
I remember right away how I looked 
across the room at you and was blown down
by the divine Angel that I saw, 
I was so in awe of you as I felt
an instant draw to this wonderful girl
just one row over from me there in school.
You're so beautiful if you only knew, 
I see it through and through in every way there is
and I want you to know just how beautiful you are.

Then as we first looked eye to eye
and began to talk my heart began to
beat so fast as it sang in joy.
Joy that such a beautiful girl would ever
want to talk to me and that I felt a connection
clearly click so very comfortable and quick, 
and when I found out just how smart you are
your beauty just grew and grew within my eyes.
You're an Angel dear that I love so much
and adore you deep and full.
You are so very beautiful and for me it's only you.

That we can just sit and talk as with you
I feel free to open up and show my soul
is the most wonderful thing that there is
and I have it with only beautiful you, 
you are my pride and joy and I want to spend
all time with you as we walk alone side by side
hand in hand forevermore fighting for each other
through everything all the way
to give each other all the best there is.

Kira you're so beautiful and I just want
to be there for you all the time no matter what it s
that you may need or want because I strive
always to make you so very happy and very proud, 
you are a diamond in the rough and rare gem
I so cherish and adore for being you, 
I just want to hold you close and heal our hearts in full
I know is perfect to her very core.
I love you babe and want you to know that you're beautiful
because you have a heart and soul of gold
and I could stare at you all day long in rapture
of the gorgeous girl that I behold.
You are beautiful my only one and you're
everything I need and want through all time. 

You're so beautiful to me because
I've seen in you a true kindness
and love held in so few.
I've seen the beautiful woman you are, 
inside and out you carry an Angelic heart.
You've always wanted the best and I've
seen you reach out to help even those
who didn't deserve a single ounce.

You've brought out the best in me and
helped me want to become a much better man.
With you I want to marry and have a partner
A family I can and will love with the woman most supreme.


You're so beautiful because I love you so much, 
people have hurt and degraded you 
so you don't even see your own beauty 
and realize how it's touched.
Your beauty is immense shining above theirs, 
let me help you remember and show 
the world how precious you are.

You're so beautiful and I mean that so deep, 
if it weren't for you I'd be totally lost
and where I'd be I don't have a clue.
So know in your heart that your beauty is true.
Inside and out and that's just one of
the millions of reasons I so deeply love you. 

If you only knew how beautiful you are to me 
you'd know I see an Angel every time I look at you. 
I get short of breath my heart first skips a beat, 
then speeds up fast, 
feeling as if it will pound right out of my chest. 

You're so beautiful I wish I had more than two pictures, 
of which I could get comfort and admire. 
That perfect smile which enraptures me through and through. 
I look at them and say I love you, I miss you so very much. 
They provide me comfort in those hardest times, 
when I'm so very lonely and need you by my side. 


You're so very beautiful to me, 
if you only knew how much. 
You're divine to me a perfect jewel. 
I just want to hold and kiss you all night long. 
You're just beautiful through and through. 

I'm feeling so very lonely today, 
I'm missing you so deeply bad.
I just want to hold you tight, 
kiss you tenderly a million times, 
then pull back to look you in the eyes
and say Kira my sweet lady from above, 
you're so beautiful you just blow me away.
How did I get so lucky to find you
and receive true love from an Angel? 
How did I get so blessed to be with
the most beautiful woman I've
always wanted, needed, and who's
true love I've always craved and desired.
You're so beautiful how does a 
homely man like me get so rewarded? 

if only you could see the glowing
precious gem you are every time I think of you.
You are so beautiful in every way.
I need my lady next to me each night and day, 
you're the only one who will fulfill and complete me.
I love you in my heart and soul fiercely
yet at the same time so tenderly.
You are so beautiful I'm in awe that you love me too. 


When you’re dread and weary
Secluded and dispirited
You found me your victim
You’re akin to a vampire
Who just awoke from a long sleep
So eagerly desirous to get
My inmost precious substance

With your deadly fingers
Mighty molars and lips
You clutched me completely
And bitten me intensely
I begged you to stop hurting me
But you did not listen
You just ignored my wish
And laughed-out-loud

After draining out my vitality
You gauged me rubbish
And then throw me somewhere
In the toilet bowl and garbage can
Now I realize living with you
Is really helpless and unproductive
But I will tell you the truth
You’ll be the loser at the end

For every tar and nicotine
That you had drawn from me
Generate great pains, misery as well
And shorten your life


No matter how many others I am with
You are the only one that I can think about
No matter how many others that I kiss
Your lips are the only ones I want.
No matter how many others I touch
Your body is the only one I dream of.
No matter how many others want my heart
You are the only one that I will give it to.
No matter how many others want inside my soul
You are the only one I will open it to.
No matter how many others there are
They will never compare to anything like you. 

I know because I tried, I know because I cried.
I know because I lied, but my passion can't be hide.
I know but I'm tired, my pain can't leave my side.
Come back I need you, after you my heart became blind. 


You're the one who broke my heart, 
You're the reason my world fell apart.
You're the one who I loved, you're the one who made me cry
Yet I'm still in love with you and I don't know why.
You always say you hate to see me hurt.
And you hate to see me cry.
So all those times that you hurt me
Did you close your eyes? 


You hurt me more then I deserve, 
How can you be so cruel? 
Love you more then you deserve, 
why am I such a fool

You're the only one
For whom I can
Cross the seas
Climb the hills, 
And scale the skies


Why? 

‘Cause you're the only one
Who evokes my feelings, 
Passions and emotions-
Beyond the boundless
Seas, the lofty hills
And the ceaseless
Skies-Love is a love
And remains always as a love
It comes and fades
It starts and remains
But where? 

Love happens and where it is next? 
We get involved in love
We feel our breath in it
Still we can't capture it
But why? 

Deep hearted dew still wet
One perfect love
But where? but why? 
Where shall I capture it? 
How? 

Well, She is gone and here
I must remain
In my words in her
Love will remain and grow
By poetry and songs
I capture you here
As you are a prisoner somewhere. 


I
You say you love ; but with a voice
Chaster than a nun's, who singeth
The soft Vespers to herself
While the chime-bell ringeth-
O love me truly!

II
You say you love; but with a smile
Cold as sunrise in September,
As you were Saint Cupid 's nun,
And kept his weeks of Ember.
O love me truly!

III
You say you love but then your lips
Coral tinted teach no blisses,
More than coral in the sea
They never pout for kisses
O love me truly!

IV
You say you love ; but then your hand
No soft squeeze for squeeze returneth,
It is like a statue's dead
While mine to passion burneth
O love me truly!

V
O breathe a word or two of fire!
Smile, as if those words should bum me,
Squeeze as lovers should O kiss
And in thy heart inurn me!
O love me truly


Baby, you can give me your heart.
I promise I won't tear it apart.
We were only friends for a minute, 
before we decided to trust the situation.
I knew how you felt and you knew how I felt.
I wanna be your soldier.
Please trust in me.
Its US that should be.
I don't know how to control myself when I'm next to you.
If it's against the law to love you; sue me! ! 
Baby, my heart is beating - can't you hear it? 
I know you're lookin out for you -
But you gotta realize I'm lookin out for Us Two.
I fantasize about what I want to do to you.
I can't go a night without your lovin.
I'm braceing for it - I can't lie.
Don't ever leave me boy.
I need you inside my world.
I have never felt what I feel with you.
Lie to me - I promise I'll believe.
Lie to me - Just please don't leave.
You Should Be With Me


you should have been painted in a lilac mist
looking out to sea yet-
holding the sea within.

you would have stood apart
by an open window, breathing-
immemorial-
the scent of pine trees where
another poet walked-

hearing the sound of the sea
holding the sea within, 
its dove-grey caesuras
meted out so carefully

like the steps to the fairytale
castle and the end of the story; 
your raspberry syllables spilling over

where there could be no decrees; 
with your friend who loved Africa
and drew giraffes on your school
slate, possibly, who hated raspberry

jam even then; 

with your small son playing
learning to walk in the
pine-needled shade; 

with your other friend, who loved life
and pure delight, praising its syllables
of true delight and small feasts managed


in distress: a tin of sardines, Armenian grapes, 
a miracle; 
banished like a real prince: 
by his side, his starling wife
hid all his poems in crummy saucepans -


and in her heart ever after

o darkened wing - o muse
o hidden stars half-turning into fire, 
Cassandra, who is listening

like snow it all disappeared
shining into a farther sea
inside you
after nothing like a Golden Age
no one in any language

can explain.


I sit at my kitchen table in America
as white as you were at the
height of Terror, 

the minute, in public housing
with other golden refugees of a
free nation

the kitchen radio proclaims: 
'A Great Nation deserves Great Art'
I think sometimes

great art deserves a great nation; 
I'm

selling my books off, one-by-one, to live; 
when I get to the last book I'll go
live under a pine tree and make
books out of pine bark

but this morning
you shine on my momentary wall
the color of buttermilk
looking for Russia, still-

looking for an open window
for the sound of the sea
for an undeniable clarity
that can't be bought or sold. 



if you don't know yourself, 
is it anywhere in the world

or only in
the next poem

that we live-


To-day his ills are over; 
You hearken to the lover's say, 
And happy is the lover. 

'Tis late to hearken, late to smile, 
But better late than never; 
I shall have lived a little while 
Before I die for ever. 

I don't know if I miss
what wasn't there. 
Or if it's the fact
that you never cared. 

I feel like a part of me
is gone. 
As it turns out, 
it was never there all along. 

Just want to let you know
You SUCK
and that's what you get
for falling in Love 


You swept me away 
took me in arms sway 
gazedly we searched 
dare i say, 
that single dropp of pearl. 
From the corner of your eye swirled 
when fell soft on me 
and gently it evoked 
our long lost desires revoked 
when fur Elise 
fills sombre air 



Dark, She is the mind of yours. 
Icy chill of thought becomes 
A steely shimmer.
Behold a glimmer in the black - 
A flash of grey, that even glows 
In show against the hallowed dark of you. 

And that is why you scream in jarring tones
'I have no heart for joy! 
My white and brittle bones have died'
You cried in dark and fractured moans.

Whence from dark of shade
That honed an evil form afar;   
In curse of me you bade: 

'I, the wave shall rape the shore! 
Violence will there be in glares I'll throw
At all who prey, and more: 
A dark and fetid sea I'll bleed.'

And now, the bitter tinge
And bleak of waste
That eyed the death of once your soul
Will here forever be!  

Indeed you tell: 
 'The cramping pain is here! 
Eternal spasm, infinite chasm, 
The Devil's chaplain plays! 
We'll climax in a tortured glee
As all my love decays.'




Dark  dark  dark dark  dark  dark  dark

You thought I was that type:
That you could forget me, 
And that I'd plead and weep
And throw myself under the hooves of a bay mare,

Or that I'd ask the sorcerers
For some magic potion made from roots and send you a terrible gift:
My precious perfumed handkerchief. 


Damn you! I will not grant your cursed soul
Vicarious tears or a single glance.

And I swear to you by the garden of the angels,
I swear by the miracle-working icon,
And by the fire and smoke of our nights:
I will never come back to you. 

Glittering eyes I say of her
And not to flatter or creamy for her
If you wish to see her
You must have my eyes for her.

Why do you or I question
When my world is resting
Parting with those eyes
Will arise conflicts for eyes.

How Shall I respond to those eyes
Which urges, urges to surrender my eyes
Repeating and reminding you with no lies
You should love to accept with no spies.

I would no longer be If I doubt
As you are in me in my eyes.


So you throw yourself away or think you must.
you who are made of diamond dust.
you, His heart's own core with daylight ahead of

blossom becoming apple in the setting sun
arrived at the terminal too early, don't! 
the cliff is glinting always there in front of you but, 

oh earth smells sweet, taken in both hands, 
rich loamed.
you throw yourself away the farther from home

the better you say; 
what's dreaming but a sleep, anyway
but I weep, -
'don't'. 

Our hearts can feel you
, by our side
, 
Deep in our souls-, we're convinced-, 
You’ve Been Our Inspiration
, 
You’ve Been Our Inspiration.


Can you realize
, all you are-, 
Something more-, than just a star
, 
Through ups and downs
, 
From where we came
, 
 Confidence kicked in
 , 
And who’s to blame
? ? ? 
No doubt it’s you
, 
You, you, you
, 
We're blessed by you. ., 
You’ve Been Our Inspiration
, 
You’ve Been Our Inspiration. 


You've made me aware, 
You've opened my eyes, 
Never saw things this way, 
Before.
 
You've made me aware, 
You've opened my heart, 
Never felt things this way, 
Before.
 
You've made me aware, 
You've opened my mind, 
Never thought these things, 
Before.
 
You've made me aware, 
Of your beautiful soul, 
Never knew this door, 
Could be opened before. 

You walk, and look like me,
Your eyes directed down.
I also used to lower mine!
Hey you, passer by, stop!

Read-when you've gathered
A bouquet of buttercups and poppies,
That I was called Marina
And how old I was.

Don't think that this is a grave,
That I will appear,scary. 
I myself loved too much 
To laugh, when I shouldn't have!

And the blood would come to my face
And my hair was curly. 
You passer by, I also was!
You passer by, stop!

Break yourself off a wild stem
And after it a berry,-
No wild strawberry is larger or sweeter
Than one from a graveyard.

Only don't stand gloomily,
Dropping your head on your chest,
Think about me easily,
As easily then forget!

How the sun's ray shines upon you!
You're all covered in golden dust. 
-Don't let it disturb you,
My voice from underground. 


Even if you crippled me for life; horrendously maiming both my arms and feet, 

Even if you made me blind; snatching inevitable centers of vision from my body, 

Even if you kicked me at every corner of life; making me taste the dirt on the dusty streets, 

Even if you stripped my flesh off; whipping me incessantly with the brutal strokes of destiny, 

Even if you made me dismally stutter; not enabling me to express myself the slightest, 

Even if you snatched my dreams; inundating all my nights with ghastly perceptions of the devil, 

Even if you made me walk on sizzling embers of fire; scorching the soles of my 
foot to unprecedented limits, 

Even if you chopped my body into infinite pieces; fed each of them to the satanically wandering vultures, 

Even if you stole the smiles from my face; engulfing me in the appalling corridors of gloom for the entire of my life, 

Even if you left a battalion of ferocious lions; thundering their way towards me; to pulverize me to mincemeat, 

Even if you inflicted upon me the most incurable of deadly disease; killing me every second with tumultuous pain, 

Even if you failed me miserably; making me dither abysmally in every sphere of life, 

Even if you compelled me to beg on the streets; starve and shiver in agonizing cold of the winter night, 

Even if you made people around me spit their saliva on my face; thrash me on my cheek to unleash their personal frustration, 

Even if you showered only me with acrimonious acid; while you pelted upon others droplets of mesmerizing rain, 
Even if you made me pathetically stumble at every step I took; always kept me sulking at the bottom of the mountain; while infact my mates had conquered it several number of times, 

Even if you made me slither helplessly on the ground; unable and extremely weak to utter even the most tiniest of sound, 

And even if you flooded my mind with negative thoughts; trying your level best to make me hate you; let me tell you that although you might have succeeded on all the previous occasions; but this time you would miserably fail; for I will always love you; and each beat of my heart; each word that I spoke; each breath that I inhaled; would immortally say; that you were the person i adored the most; you were my Creator. 


You who loved me with the falseness 
Of truth - and the truth of lies.
You who loved me-beyond
Anything!-Over the edge!
You who loved me beyond
Time-Right hand, wave!
You love me no more:
The truth in five words. 


You who never arrived 
in my arms, Beloved, who were lost 
from the start, 
I don't even know what songs 
would please you. I have given up trying 
to recognize you in the surging wave of 
the next moment. All the immense 
images in me -- the far-off, deeply-felt 
landscape, cities, towers, and bridges, and 
unsuspected turns in the path, 
and those powerful lands that were once 
pulsing with the life of the gods-- 
all rise within me to mean 
you, who forever elude me. 


You, Beloved, who are all 
the gardens I have ever gazed at, 
longing. An open window 
in a country house-- , and you almost 
stepped out, pensive, to meet me.
Streets that I chanced upon,-- 
you had just walked down them and vanished. 
And sometimes, in a shop, the mirrors 
were still dizzy with your presence and, 
startled, gave back my too-sudden image.
Who knows? Perhaps the same 
bird echoed through both of us 
yesterday, separate, in the evening


You, who was born for poetry's creation,
Do not repeat the sayings of the ancients.
Though, maybe, our Poetry, itself,
Is just a single beautiful citation. 

You will hear thunder and remember me,
And think: she wanted storms. The rim
Of the sky will be the colour of hard crimson,
And your heart, as it was then, will be on fire.

That day in Moscow, it will all come true,
when, for the last time, I take my leave,
And hasten to the heights that I have longed for,
Leaving my shadow still to be with you.


The day you were born, 
A bright star came down
To illuminate many souls
In America and the world! 
That special day, 
The spirit of hope and joy
Was reborn through you! 

Soul and Body
Magically combined
To become a reservoir
Of beauty and wisdom
Through the passage of time! 

You always sang like a bird, 
Smiled like the butterflies, 
Constantly touching the world
With your wise, inspiring
And powerful words! 
You made every single woman
To become proud of herself! 

You made the difference
In the Poetry World
By echoing through your words
And magic pen, 
The message of Peace and Love! 


You absorbed our pain, 
Sadness, hungry and emotions
While sharing unconditionally
Your true and humble love with all! 
You became the world
And the world adores you! 

You highlighted the real value
Of women all over the globe
By bringing knowledge as a goal
In order to succeed, 
No matter the color, race or creed! 

You will live forever dear
Through all of us
For generations to come! 
You have become a fountain
Of Beauty and Wisdom
That will always inspire us! 





You will never see the blood on my sword
All the lives I took even though they were ones I adored
You will never hear the screams
Silent beauties spewed from these illiterate pieces of scum
You will never have your skin become one callous 
A rough piece of skin that heals over your heart
You will never be on both knees tears pouring; 
You are hanging your head over millions of lost dreams
And brush her delicate lips
You will never hear the cries of the innocent
Blood screams begging to help
But, you run the opposite direction
Do as you will do as you please
But, the truth remains you will never see what I’ve seen
You will never lose your life to a drug while; 
Struggling to do enough
You will never scream into the face of misfortune
Hoping only to hear the words "I love you"
You will never feel a rush of throbbing consuming your head
You will never take control and make decisions like I did
You will never see the light of day at the midnight hour
It’s the sweet breath you would love to devour
You will never feel the burn of rejection like I have
You will never wish your mother never divorced your abusive dad
You will never cry yourself to sleep at night
While replaying the memories of the things you never did right
You will never feel what I have felt
Your body will never be your prison cell
And your soul will never eternally melt
You will never see what I been through
Because my eyes have sealed my memories
The truth is you will just never be me. 




We left the place where home had been,
Still wondering what we'd done,
And we went to Yorkshire, undeterred
By the hearts we'd left down South
And we couldn't believe the words we heard
From the lettings agent's mouth.

He showed us a flat near an abbatoir
Then one where a man had died
Then one with nowhere to park our car
Then one with no bath inside.
With the undertone of cheering
Of a person who impedes,
He looked straight at us, sneeering,
'You won't find a bath in Leeds'.

'We have come to Leeds from Cambridge.
We have heard that Leeds is nice.
A bath is seen in Cambridge
As an integral device,
So don't tell me that a shower
Is sufficient to meet my needs,'
I said. I received a glower
And 'You won't find a bath in Leeds'.

He fingered a fraying curtain
And I said, 'You can't be sure.
Some things in life are uncertain
And that's what hope is for.
One day I might meet Robert Redford
At Bristol Temple Meads.
I've found baths in Bracknell and Bedford
And I might find a bath'

He replied with a refutation
Which served to increase our pain
But we didn't head for the station
Or run for a rescue train,
Though we felt like trampled flowers
Who'd been set upon by weeds.
We told him to stuff his showers
And we would find a bath in Leeds.

Some people are snide and scathing
And they try to undermine
Your favourite form of bathing
Or the way you write a line.
At night, while you're busy praying
That your every plan succeeds,
There are killjoys somewhere saying,
'You won't find a bath' 


A better definition
Might be reading all of Proust,
But the concept of ambition
Has been radically reduced.
While the London wits are burning
Their cash in the Groucho club,
In Yorkshire we're simply yearning
To locate an enamel tub.

I win, Mr Bath Bad Tidings.
I have not one bath but two.
En-suite in the sweet West Ridings
And no bloody thanks to you.
I may never run fast, or tower
Over Wimbledon's top seeds
Or hit sixes like David Gower
But I have found a bath in Leeds. 

You won't last
In this sleep
If your forgetfulness
Be a halo of beauty
And if your heart wants
Only one complaint
That will be sufficient. 


when we first met
Braided in your 
silken hair
It was a day I won't forget
I can still visualize you
standing there ~

One glimpse of you 'twas
when I knew 
I found true love at last
I'll always love you darling
you are my future 
and my past ~

I bring you this bouquet 
of violets today 
As a token of my 
love for thee
In the mirror of your pretty
eyes I can see 
That our love shalt last, 
through all eternity  


Moments of regret
Days of emptiness
Nights of loneliness

Filling my heart
A man needs his lover
Roses need water

Babies need a mother
If I watered you right
If I made a wish

Turn back the hands of time
Bring back the joy I had

If I said the words
If I said them right
If I drank the juice

From your sugar lips
Wet  your rosy cheeks
With a gentle kiss

Touch, squeeze, hug you tight
Hold you all night
Stared you dead in the eyes

Ate your forbidden fruit
Said the words I love you
You would still be mine


We pass away, till at last,
our passing is so immense
that you arise: beautiful moment,
in all your suddenness,
arising in love, or enchanted
in the contraction of work.

To you I belong, however time may
wear me away. From you to you
I go commanded. In between
the garland is hanging in chance; but if you
take it up and up and up: look:
all becomes festival


A thousand doors ago
when I was a lonely kid
in a big house with four
garages and it was summer
as long as I could remember,
I lay on the lawn at night,
clover wrinkling over me,
the wise stars bedding over me,
my mother's window a funnel
of yellow heat running out,
my father's window, half shut,
an eye where sleepers pass,
and the boards of the house
were smooth and white as wax
and probably a million leaves
sailed on their strange stalks
as the crickets ticked together
and I, in my brand new body,
which was not a woman's yet,
told the stars my questions
the heat and the painted light,
elbows, knees, dreams, goodnight. 


I tried, and each attempt was a fiasco. 
I yearned, but every love of mine was wrong. 
I needed, and the shame was overwhelming. 
I failed, and so I hated being young. 

of the furious

Who take Today and jerk it out of joint   
have made new underpinnings and a Head.   


Blacktime is time for chimeful
poemhood
but they decree a
jagged chiming now.

If there are flowers flowers
must come out to the road. Rowdy!—
knowing where wheels and people are,
knowing where whips and screams are,
knowing where deaths are, where the kind kills are.   


As for that other kind of kindness,
if there is milk it must be mindful.
The milkofhumankindness must be mindful   
as wily wines.
Must be fine fury.
Must be mega, must be main.

Taking Today (to jerk it out of joint)
the hardheroic maim the
leechlike-as-usual who use,
adhere to, carp, and harm.

And they await,
across the Changes and the spiraling dead,   
our Black revival, our Black vinegar,   
our hands, and our hot blood.



       When all the world is young, lad,
         And all the trees are green;
     And every goose a swan, lad,
     Then hey for boot and horse, lad,
         And round the world away!
     Young blood must have its course, lad,
        And every dog his day.

      When all the world is old, lad,
       And all the trees are brown;
   And all the sport is stale, lad,
       And all the wheels run down;
   Creep home, and take your place there,
       The spent and maimed among;
        You loved when all was young. 



Laying on the ground
Looking into the sky
The old man enjoys
His worse days of life.

His grey mustache shivers
In the cold mist of January
Remembering the days spent
In  the mornings of December
 
Young couple looks pretty
In the wild breeze and heavy rain
Locking face to face
Ignoring the surroundings

Leaves are flying 
In and around them
Applauding and promoting



Ditches along prairie roads of Northern Illinois
Filled the arch of night with young bullfrog songs.
Infinite mathematical metronomic croaks rose and spoke,
Rose and sang, rose in a choir of puzzles.
They made his head ache with riddles of music.
They rested his head with beaten cadence.
Jimmy Wimbledon listened. 


Young butterflies, 
Please, let your tender wings grow
Before you try to hit the skies
In an attempt to early fly
When the time is not right! 
Scared to Hell you would be
If this dangerous endeavor
You would desperately try
When the time
Doesn't seem to be right! 


Take my advice
Young butterflies, 
I, the humble gardener
Who in my colorful garden
Have seen many like you
Trying to fly for the first time, 
Defying the rules of gravity
When the time is not right! 

Young butterflies, 
Listen to the echo of the wind
And let Mother Nature
Takes its course! 
While happily you welcome
The birth of a new sunrise
That would bring hope
To your tender life! 

Young butterflies, 
Let your wings grow
Until they are ready to flap
And you would be able to fly
And dance in the skies! 
Please, young butterflies, 
Listen to my humble advice! 
Wishing you luck in your first flight! 


She laughs like the Ocean's steady sway 
Her tears fall like hellfire upon her breasts
She dreams she died a thousand deaths
She hurts like the Earth's crust being cracked
She celebrates like Ancient Rome being sacked
She clings to her children like Guatanomo Bay
And her prayers are carried by Enola Gay
She is the plant phase of evolution
Her love embraces like industrial pollution
Her fear engulfs like

She carries life like grain
And as divinity she bares all pain
This is the Daughter we have raised
She's as certain as these final days




starving there, sitting around the bars,
and at night walking the streets for
hours,
the moonlight always seemed fake
to me, maybe it was,
and in the French Quarter I watched
the horses and buggies going by,
everybody sitting high in the open
carriages, the black driver, and in
back the man and the woman,
usually young and always white.
and I was always white.
and hardly charmed by the 
world.
New Orleans was a place to
hide.
I could piss away my life,
unmolested.
except for the rats.
the rats in my dark small room
very much resented sharing it
with me.
they were large and fearless
and stared at me with eyes
that spoke 
an unblinking
death.


women were beyond me.
they saw something
depraved.
there was one waitress
a little older than
I, she rather smiled,
lingered when she
brought my
coffee.

that was plenty for 
me, that was
enough.

there was something about
that city, though
it didn't let me feel guilty
that I had no feeling for the
things so many others
needed.
it let me alone.

sitting up in my bed
the llights out,
hearing the outside
sounds,
lifting my cheap
bottle of wine,
letting the warmth of
the grape
enter
me
as I heard the rats 
moving about the
room,
I preferred them
to
humans.

being lost,
being crazy maybe
is not so bad
if you can be
that way
undisturbed.


New Orleans gave me
that.
nobody ever called
my name.

no telephone,
no car,
no job,
no
anything.

me and the 
rats
and my youth,
one time,
that time
I knew
even through the
nothingness,
it was a 
celebration
of something not to
do
but only
know. 



I

I cannot heed the words they say, 
The lights grow far away and dim, 
Amid the laughing men and maids 
My eyes unbidden seek for him.

I hope that when he smiles at me 
He does not guess my joy and pain, 
For if he did, he is too kind 
To ever look my way again.

II

I have a secret in my heart 
No ears have ever heard, 
And still it sings there day by day 
Most like a caged bird.

And when it beats against the bars, 
I do not set it free, 
For I am happier to know 
It only sings for me.

III

I wrote his name along the beach, 
I love the letters so. 
Far up it seemed and out of reach, 
For still the tide was low.

But oh, the sea came creeping up, 
And washed the name away, 
And on the sand where it had been 
A bit of sea-grass lay.

A bit of sea-grass on the sand, 
Dropped from a mermaid's hair -- 
Ah, had she come to kiss his name 
And leave a token there?

IV

What am I that he should love me, 
He who stands so far above me, 
What am I? 
I am like a cowslip turning 
Toward the sky, 
Where a planet's golden burning 
Breaks the cowslip's heart with yearning, 
What am I that he should love me, 
What am I?

V

O dreams that flock about my sleep, 
I pray you bring my love to me, 
And let me think I hear his voice 
Again ring free.

And if you care to please me well, 
And live to-morrow in my mind, 
Let him who was so cold before, 
To-night seem kind.

VI

I plucked a daisy in the fields, 
And there beneath the sun 
I let its silver petals fall 
One after one.

I said, "He loves me, loves me not," 
And oh, my heart beat fast, 
The flower was kind, it let me say 
"He loves me," last.

I kissed the little leafless stem, 
But oh, my poor heart knew 
The words the flower had said to me, 
They were not true.

VII

I sent my love a letter, 
And if he loves me not, 
He shall not find my love for him 
In any line or dot.

But if he loves me truly, 
He'll find it hidden deep, 
As dawn gleams red thro' chilly clouds 
To eyes awaked from sleep.

VIII

The world is cold and gray and wet, 
And I am heavy-hearted, yet 
When I am home and look to see 
The place my letters wait for me, 
If I should find one letter there, 
I think I should not greatly care 
If it were rainy or were fair, 
For all the world would suddenly 
Seem like a festival to me.

IX

I hid three words within my heart, 
That longed to fly to him, 
At dawn they woke me with a start, 
They sang till day was dim.

And now at last I let them fly, 
As little birds should do, 
And he will know the first is "I", 
The others "Love" and "You".

X

Across the twilight's violet 
His curtained window glimmers gold; 
Oh happy light that round my love 
Can fold.

Oh happy book within his hand, 
Oh happy page he glorifies, 
Oh happy little word beneath 
His eyes.

But oh, thrice happy, happy I 
Who love him more than songs can tell, 
For in the heaven of his heart 
I dwell.


'She will change,' I cried.
'Into a withered crone.'
The heart in my side,
That so still had lain,
In noble rage replied
And beat upon the bone:

'Uplift those eyes and throw
Those glances unafraid:
She would as bravely show
Did all the fabric fade;
No withered crone I saw
Before the world was made.'

Abashed by that report,
For the heart cannot lie,
I knelt in the dirt.
And all shall bend the knee
To my offended heart
Until it pardon me. 


When the mother is left with young children, 
The hands are full and the mind is not dull, 
Her eyes are down on the children, who rattle, 
Not on the spouse, who suddenly stops to tattle, 
Young mother is as busy as a bee, flying around, 
The messy house to have the neat hive and honey, 
She is a human and needs help and love, 
Helpless responsible young mothers are great, 
For they have sacrificed their comfort for their brood, 
So many professionals gave up their career, 
For the love that they have upon their future, 
Young mothers of the world, just relax and not to cry, 
To provide what your young children need, 
To cover them with comfort of loving blanket, 
To protect them from all invisible germs and harms, 
To plant the seeds of care in their mind to bloom, 
Disciplined children are the outcome of your salty sweat, 
Continue to sacrifice as our ancestors did.


'Twas on a sunny morning in the month of May,
I met a pretty damsel on the banks o' the Tay;
I said, My charming fair one, come tell to me I pray,
Why do you walk alone on the banks o' the Tay. 

She said, Kind sir, pity me, for I am in great woe
About my young sailor lad, whose name is James Munro;
It's he has been long at sea, seven years from this day,
And I come here sometimes to weep for him that's far, far away. 

Lovely creature, cease your weeping and consent to marry me,
And my houses and all my land I will give to thee,
And we shall get married without any delay,
And live happy and contented on the banks o' the Tay. 

Believe me, my sweet lady, I pity the sailor's wife,
For I think she must lead a very unhappy life;
Especially on a stormy night, I'm sure she cannot sleep,
Thinking about her husband whilst on the briny deep. 

Oh, sir! it is true, what you to me have said,
But I must be content with the choice I've made;
For Munro's he's young and handsome, I will ne'er deny,
And if I don't get him for a husband, believe me, I will die. 

Because, when last we parted, we swore to be true,
And I will keep my troth, which lovers ought to do;
And I will pray for his safe return by night and by day,

Forgive me, noble heart, for asking to marry you,
I was only trying your love, if it was really true;
But I've found your love is pure towards your sailor lad,
And the thought thereof, believe me, makes my heart feel glad. 

As homeward we retraced our steps her heart seemed glad,
In hopes of seeing again her brave sailor lad,
He had promised to marry her when he would return,
So I bade her keep up her spirits and no longer mourn. 

Dear creature, the lass that's true to her sweetheart deserves great praise,
And I hope young Munro and you will spend many happy days,
For unto him I know you will ever prove true,
And perchance when he comes home he will marry you. 

What you have said, kind sir, I hope will come true,
And if it does, I'll make it known to you;
And you must come to the marriage, which you musn't gainsay,
And dance and rejoice with us on the marriage-day. 

When we arrived in Dundee she bade me good-bye,
Then I told her where I lived, while she said with a sigh,
Kind sir, I will long remember that morning in May,
When I met you by chance on the banks o' the Tay. 

When three months were past her sailor lad came home,
And she called to see me herself alone,
And she invited me to her marriage without delay,
Which was celebrated with great pomp the next day. 

So I went to the marriage with my heart full of joy,
And I wished her prosperity with her sailor boy;
And I danced and sang till daylight, and then came away,
Leaving them happy and contented on the banks o' the Tay. 

So all ye pretty fair maids, of high or low degree,
Be faithful to your sweethearts when they have gone to sea,
And never be in doubts of them when they are far away,
Because they might return and marry you some unexpected day. 


Write as you will
In whatever style you like
Too much blood has run under the bridge
To go on believing
That only one road is right.

In poetry everything is permitted.

With only this condition of course,
You have to improve the blank page.



You speak for the lakes, the trees and the birds
You say what they'd say if they had the words.
Make PEACE and be proud, choose well every choice
Speak HOPE and speak loud, you are Nature's voice.
Speak with respect now, for jungles and streams, 
Speak for all wildlife and dream giant dreams.
Speak with great courage, speak up and speak out, 
Write with a whisper or write with a SHOUT! 
Stand up young poets for clean air and rivers, 
Free verse or lyric; your message delivers. 
Truth to the future citizens of earth, 
Speak of your freedom your friends and self worth.
Speak for tomorrow and though you're still young, 
Speak for the Forest, your pen is her tongue.
The world waits to hear your songs still unsung
Words posses power, you can write the wrongs
Teach us and lead us with Poems and with songs.
Speak now for nature, for trees and for birds, 
Defenders of Earth choose carefullly your words


The sea is never still. 
It pounds on the shore 
Restless as a young heart, 
Hunting.

The sea speaks 
And only the stormy hearts 
Know what it says: 
It is the face 
of a rough mother speaking. 

The sea is young. 
One storm cleans all the hoar 
And loosens the age of it. 
I hear it laughing, reckless. 

They love the sea, 
Men who ride on it 
And know they will die 
Under the salt of it 

Let only the young come, 
Says the sea. 

Let them kiss my face 
And hear me. 
I am the last word 
And I tell 
Where storms and stars come from. 


You’re an artist, not Picasso or Vangogh
You’re an artist, not professional I know
You’re the creator of your own world
You’re the designer of your life

Mold the clay around your mood
Paint the picture that you choose
Do the things you want to do
Be the artiest, just be you

Create the vision in your mind
Mix the colors that life combines
Be your best friend, just be you
That’s Picasso and Vangogh


like all creatures and mammals! 

We Humans so, yet, left the Path of Nature Some where, 
we stored food and made ourselves Kings and so rude! 

We made many wars. , know not why, and killed, 
Only had that witness of Blood that we spilled! 

Yes then we found things for our way.., 
we made something called Money, 
yet we only have to live eating what you made from nature's way! 

And.. we made many a borders but can not stop any birds across, 
we made Visas and papers for we do not see hearts as we all miss! 

Damn we, we made rules and fails and made something(s) , 
and call it 'International day(s)   of this and that, 
He and She, that and this.. for all our Guilt(s) ! 


we are just on the verge of Making in Quick, 
'International day of Right Click and left Click'! 



I see in my reflection a picture of your lovely face
I hear in my voice, yours, so melodiously sweet
I feel you wrapped in my arms, when you’re not there
I try to make love to you everywhere in my dreams
But it isn’t as sweet as when you’re near and closer
Anything isn’t as better as when we’re one and together

I see in your heart that there’s a lot of pure gold
Each time I think of you, there’s a longing to hold
To draw you into my arms and tell you how I feel
To kiss your forehead and know for once that it’s real
Inasmuch as I try to fight the distance to be with you
I always break down and my days become so damn blue

I don’t know for how long this would continue my dear
But all I have to tell you is I live each new day in fear
Fear that I may never see you now that I have enough life
Fear that you may never ever become my dearest wife
Each time I’m alone in my most secret world and place
These thoughts when they come I can’t ever try to erase


Come closer to me
And make me your baby-doll
I wanna cry loud


When i see your smile
i have no coice but to kiss you
because if I dont kiss you
i know that i will regret the rest of my life! 

your hug is my life
your kiss is my soul
your eyes lead me 
to a world unknown

that only I can see
through your beautiful
Green Eyes


I remember
vividly those serene eyes, 
shining  bright, 
emotion in them
Sparks my blood to rise

Thy teary  eyes divine, 
Speak with love and tenderness, 
Eyes, a million stars in them
The picture of innocence.

Eyes seeking me -
glowing, 
like that first dew
on the new viridescent blade of grass.


Your eyes my matinal star
Your eyes my middays sunshines, 
your eyes my vespers twilight, 
your eyes an oceanic depth, 
your eyes my autumnal hues, 
Your eyes wild jasmines
Fragrant at nights, 
Like that  sunflower 
Gazing the afternoon sun.


Let the peacocks  vauntingly dance, 
let the nightingales melodiously sing, 
let the flora and fauna flourish, 
like spring in prosperity, 
in felicitation, 
LET ME ALWAYS
SEE
THROUGH YOUR EYES


Your Beautiful Smile

Life is a mystical winding
Woven around happy and sad things
It flows like ripples of water
Turned me into perpetual carter
Mirth & peace play games of guile
But I never realized
It's next to me, your beautiful smile

Rarely, blink my eye on  odd notion
Life's filled with dreary commotion
Whole year seems concised in a day
My own shadow made me partying bay
Happiness seemed to be so labile
But I never realized, 
It's always next to me, your beautiful smile 

 
The  Smile 
Beautifully unzips around your face
Annihilate griefs without trace
Arouse me to  pinnacle of elation
Embraces me this  beautiful creation
Melodramatic life made me fragile
Protected and cared by your beautiful smile 



Your beauty once was gold -
Brightly sung
-From the soothing voice of dusk
To a hooting owl behind the mask-
Glitters nevermore! 
Your sight as a sycamore's
Nightly died alone  
Before the crows! 
Your eyes had once gilded the eve
That skies shall soon bereave  
-They died as the sea tides-
Now lies where the moon abides. 


Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you.
And though they are with you, they belong not to you.
You may give them your love but not your thoughts.
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,
Which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite.
And He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
Let your bending in the archer's hands be for happiness;
For even as He loves the arrow that flies,
So He loves the bow that is stable. 


The howling wind that has no life, 
Seeks my own with both blood and knife; 
And if It think it’d win, it's dead wrong. 


Woe unto thee, who like Lady Macbeth, 
Would bash the heads of gentle babes; 
Whose tongue seed discord amongst men, 
You would end and your works go to naught. 
You are but witches of the night’s wind, 
Who seekst good thanes to betray the King; 
Then when he’s fallen ye watch and sing; 
In chants, and songs deserving of great scorn. 


The blood of your hand shall be made flames, 
And upon your body great worms shall feast, 
As you watch your flesh wane, and bones grow. 
The cords of your wilted heart shall hang strong. 
And for all the day and night you would not die, 
You would look with parched tongues to the sky 
With eyes of the babes whose head you crushed; 

And unto thee Heaven was given in prime 
But you choose instead rubies, and gold, Dirt, 
Kingdoms, riches and the pleasures of the earth, 
But even diamonds won’t stand the fires of hell; 
And tried gold would simmer like molasses. 
But in it your bones would stand their ground 
They, and the worms that feast upon you. 
Who drew his son’s blood to quench the flames, 
For all they that earnestly call upon his name; 
Such are the elect, who shall sit with him in Paradise.


People choose to live in shades, 
Thousands of designations, 
Have killed the creative enthusiasm, 
With the shillings and dollars, 
Creation is the work of the perfect, 
Perfect in every word and weakness, 
Creativity from the imagination, 
Say good bye, once under influence, 
Let the mind be free, not aware of greed, 
Money and the needs can destroy it.


When the needs of many neglected, 
the flare of creativity outshine, 
Relationships are wrecked and, 
Sometimes displayed as the bare bones, 
The creating minds are nuisance, 
To the owners, as many are stubborn, 
As the inert social elements, 
But these shine and useful to everyone, 
Who knows to make use of these mind, 
Highly active even during nap, 
Readily combustible with ignition tips, 
If you have one, keep it safe, 
The choice is always yours. 


It is a morbid grey ambiance 
In your obsession of stealth
In your world of tarot & incantations
Rags, red threads, bottles & terminal breaths; 

In your world of crosses to bear
Burning your bridges before you attempt to cross
In your book of chairs & names- -keeping tally
X-ing out each mortality like an accomplished loss; 

Invocations-incantations and idol worship
Goes against everything in my life
You with your love of scissors- is cutting
But never as sharp as your enemies 'knife'; 

And the darkness that resides within
Across the pond-your darkness lives on
Corrupting troll of 'mortal sin'; 

Your answer for everything is to pause a while
'Til at least the sirens -  quiet down
Retreating away with family and like minded
Removing titles-still so easily found; 

I have made a promise- truly
In all of your years you've never heard
You haven't heard the last from this little bird; 

For we will be watching even when you think we are not
When you believe you've found 'another way'-and the coast is clear
That is the very moment we truly get our chance with you
Could it be- that your number is nearly up my dear? 



Where they have been, if they have been away,
or what they've done at home, if they have not -
you make them write about the holiday.
One writes My Dad did. What? Your Dad did what?

That's not a sentence. Never mind the bell.
We stay behind until the work is done.
You count their words (you who can count and spell);
all the assignments are complete bar one

and though this boy seems bright, that one is his.
He says he's finished, doesn't want to add
anything, hands it in just as it is.
No change. My Dad did. What? What did his Dad?

You find the 'E' you gave him as you sort
through reams of what this girl did, what that lad did,
and read the line again, just one 'e' short:
This holiday was horrible.


Although I know her best
& it’s me she trusts

The manager insists it’s he
who’ll tell her

her Dad
is dead.

He eager to show off
his prowess

in the newly acquired
Sign language.

His hands
shape the sound

she cannot hear

searching the empty air
for the meaning

hidden there
Death torn out of the sky.

She goes berserk
not because he’s conveyed the news

but because
of his inept fingers

the bang bang mime of dead
morphs mistakenly into the sign
for our four legged friend.

"My Dad is a dog? "
her fingers tear the air apart in fury.

The ugly signs
dropping to the ground

in a big silent klunk.

I tell her quickly
what she needs to know

& now
she wishes back

the supposed
insult.

His death still hanging there
as if sculpted there.

A rainstorm breaks
as if trying to wash it away.

I take her
in my arms

and she cries
his death

into me.


All these years later
her tears

still nailing me
to her agony.



Why? Do you know? 

In first glint glance 
Sense your cense. 

I’m voodooed  
Hooked n’ wooed.

Flowething fragrance
Why I’m in brazen trance? 
.
Intolerably turbulent
Why I’m spumy opulent? 

No toodle-oo in ouch pouch
Club with decor butterfly brooch.


Come O’ Dear closer
Snip tear closure 
Foliate bedeck 
Satiate visual starter.

Just a zippy smooch 
For my pleasure ouch.

I’m juicing inside out
For your aah-ing hug bout.

I’m cathartic crush crunch
Bonanza of buxom blazing brunch.

Be sure to douse n’ drench
Make me your munch wench.

Why not you Google me? 
Cuddlefiddle bask my sonsie. 

Heave my alpha omega
Sousedouse ev’ry aura
Navigate utopia 
Zeroing all dystopia.

Your dame diva gaga.


Neat and tidy mark your way.
Melodiously utter your words, 
Like the chirping of birds.

Uprightly perform your duty, 
In it lies your beauty.
Straightforwardly refuse the wrong, 
Being brave and headstrong, 

Without delay, doubt and flaw.
Rest in peace, as long you lay.




I’ve seen you baring breasts in the east, 
Walking on waves that are lavishly caressing your
Calves
While I drowned underneath you, as I drowned underneath
That bus: 
And I’ve always thought of you though even now I
Am not young
And no longer know that ladder up to your grapes
The sly fox has in his lips anyway, the man that has 
Your name, 
So like everything that is clever with anything you
Are driving forever away through the storm, 
Your headlights looking at new animals, 
So all I can see is you leaving, like all the planets that should
Have existed like tiny orbs for my lips and phallus to
First suckle and then to prick, 
So that all I have are these feeble words, these younger
Man’s toys, who feed their sorrows to the fish, 
And then go on wishing their 
Sophomoric pines, while you have turned into an 
Incredible Indian with a beautifully alien world shooting
Up red tongued through the sweet armpits of
Your delivering mind. 


The stores are freshly open; they are waiting 
As in this very night the moon sweeps clean the
Streets; 
And it haloes a goddess, she is you; 
But tonight I went to the theatre with my sister, 
And sat for hours just eating peanuts, 
Because I couldn’t figure out the attraction without
Your soliloquies, the remote control
Boats in the papier-mache sea were not there, 
Telegraphed by your eyes, 
All the blue-green creatures of the zoo well-spun
In their false habitats were gone; 
And the little girls were weeping from the cypress
Shoots before transmogrifying into herons, 
And they too flew away; 
So I drove home, watching out for elk, barely speaking, 
So dysfunctional- Went straight to the liquor cabinet
And to bed, 
Hoping I might find you there, but you never spoke
To me; unless your eyes were closed and camouflaged; 
Restless, I struck out for the moon, and thought to
See you lying there like a flickering lamp in an ancient
Room, but coming to it I saw that it was another
Girl, she herself hoping to find a gentle young man, 
But I did not love her, 
And making some excuse fell to bed weeping, 
Wanting the airplanes you fly upon wherever you are
To land restive like tin-can birds, and you there only passenger
Strung out finally having found a good place to stay the winter. 


I can see you flying in the full moon sky 
Like an enchanting fairy.
Your smiling face and glittering eyes 
Are calling me to enjoy the beauty of night. 

In the silver light I am mesmerized 
By your celestial beauty. 
My senses are benumbed 
As if I have had vintage or opium. 

Now I am with you in the garden of sky
To watch your charming beauty in the full moon.
You are dancing like a goddess 
To fill my heart with joy and happiness. 

Now I am beyond the reach of Time
And far away from fret and disease. 
My heart aches with excessive joy 
To have your affinity and care. 

No matter if now the earth stops to move; 
No matter if the whole universe gets destroyed; 
No matter if Death's icy hands touch my head
As your divine embrace has made me ecstatic. 


Even as the sun was old and disappearing
Behind the slats of trees, 
Into the autumns seasons which misspell
And do not get up again after they have bent down: 
And I have looked out for you against the traffic’s
Flow, and through the rattling shadows from the
Landscaping brushed against the dun buildings: 
Somehow they have made it all to hide you, 
And everything is more forgetful even as it comes into
Its time; and I am chained and unrequited
And my eyes are brown and so are yours: 
They want to move across you lazily and calm, 
And give truisms into the loci of rest bowed into your arms, 
But already the old are disappearing and the shadows congest, 
The sea is leaping and yipping into the west, 
And there are better men for you who are breathing in
Their time, and they move about you in the gentle gravities
Of courtship, and the dunes have drunken in the tide
When I would have thought to find you
Where the palm trees stand like a stoical chorus or
Sorority, and move with you there clasped in a coupling
Arc, and to have swung with you in a studious dream, 
Until nested in a creche made from the springy, pealed bows
Of your doused religion. 


Your egoic spire and its altar__

there I’m lying down
quietly like a question mark.

My words are eager to offer
but remain unuttered. 


It rains in my garage as the clouds come down
Over some nameless guy riding his bicycle, 
But it becomes so easy, because there are no mountains; 
And all of my dogs are missing, 
But the world is no less beautiful: he gives you hickeys for
All the world to see: you give my those too, but for 
Us alone, 
And our two bodies become a private midway that I don’t want 
Taken from me; 
Even though I am so bankrupt and so fallow, and the lions
Are staring at me with eyes wider than their glorious mouths: 
I want you to travel towards me now, you little brown
Feet as lucky as rabbits multiplying in a house of mirrors, 
Forgiving to me my prolific failures, 
And enrapturing me in a garden returned to me of your esoteric 
And so young body. 


Your eyes beheld me
Flooded with a deluge of affection
Imprisoning me in depths unmeasured

Your gaze was long and penetrative
It made me flinch and reel
It cut through me like a dagger
I couldn’t escape its fire
I couldn’t break its chains

Your eyes, deep as ocean
Your eyes, seeing as wisdom
Your eyes, full as love
Your eyes, burning as hell
Your eyes, your eyes
I loved and feared. 


Your eyes

Your eyes sparkle
There like an emerald green
They me feel happy
But then they make me cry

Your eyes used to be mine 
No one else could see them
I love the way you used to look at me
But that is no more

Your eyes would make me smile
My smile would make you smile 
But I haven’t been smiling any more
With out your lovely eyes

I miss your eyes
The way they glow 
The thing I miss most about your eyes
Is the person they belong to


Your eyes do not answer me: 
You have a lover you stare upon.
Like a hungry bird, 
You put your lips to his open
Palm and give soft pecks, 
Dewing his lifeline with your spittle
In which your tears catch like blue flies.
And he tames you like a skilled
Trainer, placing you
Into the better days where your life
Strokes like a teenage athlete
Warm under the sun at a swim meet.
The chlorine in the pool makes sure
Your body is clean as you 
Kick your line and
Sun the shellacs you an auburn sheen
The elastic curves of your swimsuit, 
Keeping your hidden flesh 
The color of a whitewashed picket fence, 
Punctuated by a couple roses.
You sometimes allow your eyes to
Admire your virgin flowers as you decide what
To wear to school.
Finished and placing well, 
You drive away in his car.
Giving long stares to his silhouette, 
You fall into his arms in a dark
And comfortable living room
Paid for in the heart of 
The malaise of suburbia
You lounge and make advances toward
Love making, but only allow
Him to taste your lips, 
To put his thumbprints in secret
Stamps under your clothes, 
To kiss recklessly again, like
Water spilled out from buckets 
Hurriedly handed from one to the next
Filled one way with gasoline
And the next water, 
To first start and then put out
A fire. 
You take a shower 
As he cooks you brownies
And then uses his fingers to
Shovel food into your cheeks. 
Wearing a towel, 
You eat and
Fall asleep in his arms until he drives away.
In class you dream of him, 
Through mathematics and English, 
Science and social studies, your 
Mind performs experimental fantasies
Starring him.
I watch you from the back corner
Of class, but you never turn my way
Or speak my name.
Your eyes have nothing to say to me, 
But I see you five days a week
And the boy you always eat lunch with.
I don’t know who he is
Only that he captivates your stare
As he attracts your attention.
One day you graduated and drove away
With him. I am still standing on 
The last spot I saw you, 
Watching you faithfully, a senior
Lost in the labyrinth of these high
School memories
Where your eyes never turned my way.


When I am alone with myself, 
your face still surfaces
from the heaps of old memories.

You carried in your eyes
a wide, single stare: 
bright, innocent, full of joy.

You showed me a landscape: 
blue sky, sunlight, 
soaking green, raw earth.

You spoke in words, 
not contrived – words locked
in your quivering heart-beats.

But, blurred by the glitter
of life on the surface, 
I failed to read your hints.

And you went away, leaving me
in faceless crowds, 
to my featureless galloping years.

Now, returns in waning days
the forgotten alphabet, writing
on blank pages a note of regret. 


Staring into the darkened pools
Of your blue eyes
Pearls of pain were falling
Tears of a terrible time
Etched in the ice of your memories
They froze upon your cheeks and glistened
Glowed with the fragrance of the forgotten times
We shared before the end


And now
I see your face
In the depths of the roaring tide
Staring up at me
From beneath the waves in which you died
 
For a while I thought I saw you smile
Through the mist
Across the miles
I'm sure I saw you smile

And still I see your face
Shimmering in the depths
Of this river
This void
 

You waver like summer evening haze
Alive with wonder in my tomb
I smile down to you
So deep
 
I see the sky in your eyes
I feel the water wrapping me up
Engulfing, enfolding, caressing you
In thoughts of real wisdom
Of life

I begin to learn what it all means
But when I touch the silver surface, 
You flee
And your smile fades
In a wondrous way
Across the surface of the water


Our village roads are not tarred and concreted, 
Red soiled paths leveled and polished by our foot prints, 
Our Highways are better, but built by the foreigners, 
The town roads are the worst with potholes and hanging wires, 
Someone dig the roads for something and leave it, 
The people of India walk on the roads as it is, 
The way to live the life, in the pitiful style and manner, 
Everyone speaks, everyone knows, but no one bothers, 
Summer is the time for the nuclear plant of universe to scotch, 
At the people of India, who live in huts and slums, 
Less than eight feet high to keep the house cool, 
Dried Thatched roof allow the rain and light, 
People gather the disposed plastics to seal and hide, 
Persistent sun rays pierce through the plastic sheets, 
Life is not tough for the people who have these abode, 
As they have no time to think and cry of their grief, 
When the tough life is the real life for them and many, 
Tougher they are, to face the challenging destiny, 
People on the roads, sea of heads walk with a purpose, 
I do not know what that purpose is, but everyone busy, 
India is one of the countries, where people struggle to survive, 
Not the survival properly planned and implemented, 
IT and computers have changed our landscape, 
High rises are seen here and there in Metro and Cosmo, 
Prices of the land escalated as high as Everest, 
We have joined the elite group of nuclear war fare, 
But Indians, who work in India, can't own a residence, 
Scarcity of water, electricity and stress, is abundant, 
No one force us to follow, but the rituals are followed, 
With utter obedience and our strength gets strengthened.
Our Men love their female folks and our women too, 
Squabble may occur in a relationship, but not in our family unit, 
The parents of India strive hard to keep this unit unbroken, 
Our children grow to mature to follow the same unshaken. 


But O' how far away thy Heaven's? 
That drift in between
Each Ethereal cloud
Hiding or concealing it's location
Behind a velvet cereulan shroud? 
The azure blue in this coverlet
Makes a statement divine to thy will
Upon thy lace of heaven's doorstep
Come one, saint or sinner
Admist these divine Pearl clad gates
And tiptoe upon the atmosphere's velvet
So then too, you shall understand


Burning through the spirits of your ancestors, 
Alma, 
I’ve begun having feverish dreams of the skinny valleys of
Guerrero Mexico, 
Your home town and how you like your men: maybe that is 
Why you flirt with Armando, the little maricon, 
Even though today at lunch you echoed my syllables when I
Told you I loved you, 
Even though you would like to put it off as a lie, 
But I can tell you only the empiricisms of the world can tell you
The tin kettle joys of the coral snake on your roof: 
There he is, and you will never see him, but I have culled him out
Of the places your family works together, 
Those who are renting: 
Your extended family has done so well for themselves in the eight
Years that they have been in this foreign country: 
I could do half as well, except that I am a gringo and accustomed to
The penumbras of these rolling overpasses, 
And the divine mirages of the slowly floating helicopters, 
And these sad lies- Except that I love you, Alma, 
And I have my house that you’ve been to four times, and the last time
We made love for hours, 
And you came multiple times: and your favorite color is still green, 
Alma, 
And I pray every night to the virginsita that I have done work good
Enough to become your favorite Mexican boy.


When I cannot look at your face 
I look at your feet. 
Your feet of arched bone, 
your hard little feet. 
I know that they support you, 
and that your sweet weight 
rises upon them. 
Your waist and your breasts, 
the doubled purple 
of your nipples, 
the sockets of your eyes 
that have just flown away, 
your wide fruit mouth, 
your red tresses, 
my little tower. 
But I love your feet 
only because they walked 
upon the earth and upon 
the wind and upon the waters, 
until they found me. 


If I am waiting to fill out and become the 
Man that can drive you around in 
Barrel-chested trucks, will you come for me
When I am ready for you, 
And let me take you out into the bonfires
Of the southwest; 
And I wont cut my hair- and it will be just as gray
And silver as the smoke and the airplanes through it; 
And you wont even have to look at me, 
You can just cast your eyes high into those nets, 
Dreaming of acrobats always falling through the burning
Serenity in
A pleasant though arresting way; 
And I can keep a steady glance on you watching you like
A cat watches a child, full of daydreams and hunger, 
So that when your eyes finally come to my own
I can return your foremost of senses; 
And we can believe together that most of this is real.


I have a question I wish you would answer, 
To give me a little piece of mind, 
Tell me your game so I'll know who to blame, 
And I won't be so terribly blind

I have this question only you can answer, 
so I'll know all the rules by my heart, 
It's so hard to play if you don't learn the game, 
I forever seem to end at the start

Just give me a clue, is it all from the mind
Or does your heart play a part in this too? 
Is it men that move around on the board
And the women that constantly lose? 

Can you just throw the dice, then call it gamble, 
Or is gamble always the name? 
What is my risk, must I bet with your chips? 
To be honest I'm not good at these games

So I'll throw in my hand, I won't lose my heart
The stakes that you bet are too high
You cheat when you play, changing rules on the way, 
So I'll fold and just bid you good-bye. 


Knee high in your thorns, i stand
The roses of long ago- wilted away
Bleeding from copious wounds, i am
Deep within your Garden Of Today; 
Hurtful, dark, woeful words in granite
Pour from your mouth- most insane
In this cemetary of tombstones leaning
Is a graveyard of verbal abuses pain; 
Blood and gore and all things dark & dirty
Death, and breath- a vapor- most profane
Evil's twitching out another bag of bones
As Hellfire and damnation- are truly your bane;


Pray for grace take time
each day to reflect on your
Thoughts words and actions


My sense of smell is not real; 
I will give you this bouquet, and then I
Will go away and die.
My dogs will wait for me barking like a 
Cenotaph in the waves, 
The cormorants  wonderful as kites
Of little boys, 
Your oldest sons who look at you, whose 
Love I cannot steal; 
Cars to school, 
Then my nose will disappear as if it was lost in
A knife fight; 
And you will have good reason not to love me, 
A nose less man, 
Knowing of the unstopped aromas of your
Boudoir; 
It is laughable that we should all go this way, 
The baseball players in the red gems of sky; 
And I in my golden gem of fireworks, 
Brain-sunken now like a gaunt tortoise beside
The black cats hyperventilating beneath your canal; 
And you will come swimming like a pungent mermaid, 
And I wont even be able to smell your farts; 
And I would have other men describe them to me, 
But they will be as mute and piss-stain as 
Frightened children, 
I could easily still friend and hide their plastic rewards
Above the church of my mother’s refrigerator; 
And then tomorrow afternoon, Tuesday, 
Meet you in the park and see your new
Butterfly tattoo, 
And grab your leg like a speech and try to smell the
Flower on your ankle; 
But I really just want to smell your flower before
I die, 
And am so noxious as to overpower myself for the love
Of your glorious perfumes. 


Entangled in the depth of your blue eyes
.  

Entranced and in total bliss. 
Embraced by your circled arms tight grasp
.  

Energized by your heavenly kiss. 

We two are as a gift package

Gift papered and tied with silk bow. 
A grand presentation of sheer quality

Of the sweet you that i have come to know.

                        Golden  Pen



Daffodils in the penumbra of my uneasy afflictions; 
And unicorns, 
And I know you cannot look at me, or be my true love, 
But I just want to escort you still out into the
Yard, 
To hold your hand like the page of a soft mammal, 
To watch you metamorphose on the strings; 
To leave off you like a dead boy with
Blue socks in the weeds to Canterbury, 
If you can’t be my fable, if you can’t be my dream: 
Then I will not want to take your beauty, 
The hope of all your freckles, the shadows of the heavens
Or goldfish flirting with the cat’s saber tooth; 
I just want to pay my dollar to get a good look at you, 
To tip my bottle and well perceive the beauty as
You wash your feet in the lucky river; 
If want to be your weary fetish, the knuckle bone of skeleton
Rubbed in your pocket, your silver boy kept in the
Secrets of the railroad tracks; 
And if you are never to come around again, to be like a single raindrop
Quiver on your roof, never looking indoors as you learn from
Your teachers, as you have children and pools, 
As you divide and multiply and live by your golden rules. 



Suffer
greedy bites; 
Leave the apple now



When your hands leap
towards mine, love,
what do they bring me in flight?
Why did they stop
at my lips, so suddenly,
why do I know them,
as if once before,
I have touched them,
as if, before being,
they travelled
my forehead, my waist?
Their smoothness came
winging through time,
over the sea and the smoke,
over the Spring,
and when you laid
your hands on my chest
I knew those wings
of the gold doves,
I knew that clay,
and that colour of grain.
The years of my life
have been roadways of searching,
a climbing of stairs,
a crossing of reefs.
Trains hurled me onwards
waters recalled me,
on the surface of grapes
it seemed that I touched you.
Wood, of a sudden,
made contact with you,
the almond-tree summoned
your hidden smoothness,
until both your hands
closed on my chest,
like a pair of wings
ending their flight.


So you’ve given your Heart to me-
Do I keep it or give it back
Do I at all need it
Was it worth the wait
Why did you lose your heart to me? 
Or did you give it out of sympathy-
Do you think I deserved it-
Or was it one of your many
Give-aways
As you’ve always done with ‘others’ of my kind


Or were you being sincere, loving and true
When you considered giving me: 
Your Heart
And will you take it back from me
Once the ‘rosiness’ is over-
When we’ve had our share of making love, 
When you no longer fancy me, 
Having ‘felt’ me inside-out- 
And then give it to that someone else
who would woo you as I did


Mind you, my love-
If ever you could be loved so much
It has to be me, and only me-
loving Him and loving You-

at peace with my loneliness, 
I learned to live, longing for you-
‘merely existing’ – you might say, 
Yet still livable than a ‘living death’
Once you snatch your heart from me


So my love, there is still time, 
Tell me it’s not yet true: 
That you falling for me
Cannot ever and ever be true-
Let me keep on loving you
Longing for you 
Just the way I do
Forever and ever and ever so-
You keep your heart to yourself
for I don’t yet deserve you, 
and you don’t have to heed me
just so as I keep asking you. 


There are some mysteries that I can’t fathom yet
Like the beauty of the world from afar, at sunset
The shivers of lovers who for the first time met
And the way that I’m trapped in your heart’s net

Sometimes, I’m dumb and in total loss for words
Sometimes, I feel like I’m pierced with a sword
Sometimes, I feel terribly weak and vulnerable
Just basking in the comfort of your eyes’ paradise

There are some truths that I don’t believe yet
That I lose my manliness, head on your thighs
That I feel horses trod my heart in your presence
And my lips quiver when I’m staring at your face


It’s totally unimaginable how you wield your magic
Like I found it really hard trying to write these lines
There was a terrible aching and longing in m heart
A yearning that would bring bliss only with your kiss



Tis a holy place
Blessing and healing



There were infinite voices that lingered in this Universe; some as tangy as the vivacious oceans; while some blew more hoarser than the volatile dragons, 

There were infinite hair that floated in this Universe; some as hideously obdurate as the pigs skin; while some more tantalizing than the ultimate of seductresses, 
But your ravishing follicles were the only ones which tickled every iota of my entire demeanor; making me perpetually dream even in the most chaotic pandemonium
besieging me from all sides.

There were infinite lips that kissed in this Universe; some as blunt as miserably squashed tomato curry; while some more voluptuous than the contours of the
milky moon, 
But your uninhibited smiles were the only ones which triggered in me blistering infernos till the sky; giving me a new mission to exist; at every fading footstep of mine.

There were infinite shadows that fluttered in this Universe; some as mystical as the ethereal mirages; while some more tumultuously effusive than the chattering peacocks, 
But your majestic reflection was the only one which cast an impregnable spell upon my countenance; as I found myself in the land of ultimate paradise; every time I rattled up from deep sleep.

There were infinite eyes that revolved in this Universe; some as seducing as the angels bouncing in the cosmos; while some more silent than morbid stones strewn rampantly near the corpse, 
But your gloriously royal eyelashes were the only ones I sighted; propelling me to incessantly flirt; nostalgically drifting me back into those moments once again; when I was an innocuous child.

There were infinite hands that philandered in this Universe; some as magnetic as the lotus's caress; while some more pugnaciously harder than the toughest of bricks, 
But your immaculate fingers were the only ones which impregnated in me the tenacity to defend; rise up to every occasion and obstacle in monotonously pragmatic
life.

There were infinite skins that stimulated in this Universe; some as impeccable as flawless cow's milk; while some more vibrant than the unfathomable battalion of swarming bees, 
But your alluring flesh was the only one which titillated me beyond realms of unlimited eternity; making me desire above all the wonderful beauty 
profusely deluging this planet.

There were infinite breaths that weaved in this Universe; some as fiery as the volcano's swirlingfrenziedly towards the clouds; while some more serene than the magnificently cushioned waters of the placid lake, 
But your heavenly fragrance was the only one which I wholeheartedly inhaled; instilling in me the insurmountable capacity to live a thousand lives; in a single lifetime.

And there were infinite hearts that palpitated in this Universe; some as rhythmic as the wonderfully cascading waterfalls; while some more passionate than the flamboyant rays of the golden Sun, 
But your immortal beats were the only ones which had bonded with mine even centuries before I was born; infact the sole reason that I was breathing blissfully
today; staring death in its face; and yet alive. 



When my love was on your hair; it lingered in overwhelming fascination; of your majestic exuberance drifting royally with the compassionate winds, 

When my love was  on your forehead; it bonded with threads of your sacred imagery; the mesmerizing fantasies that revolved in your mind, 

When my love was  on your eyebrows; it moved subtly like a crown princess; everytime you raised them toquell; the innocent quandaries of your life, 

When my love was  on your eyelashes; it frolicked like a new born child; relinquishing all apprehensions of the uncouthly manipulative society, 

When my love was  on your eyes; it eyes; it witnessed the extraneous earth outside; as the most unsurpassably divine mission of existence, 

When my love was  on your nose; it coined new definitions of an optimistic tomorrow; feeling stronger than any entity alive; in the swirl of your impregnable breath, 

When my love was on  your cheeks; it mischievously philandered in the mountains of desire; profusely astounded by your seductive flurry of crimson blushes, 

When my love was on your lips; it learnt the ultimate kiss of its life; exploring the rhapsodic periphery and the fabulous pink; to the most insatiable of its heart's content, 

When my love was on your teeth; it felt more secure than the impregnable fortress; as you clenched them into your immaculate smile, 

When my love was on your throat; it romanced in the tunes of stupendously melodious enchantment; wholesomely lost in the cadence of unfathomably unending ecstasy, 

When my love was on your Adams apple; it rejoiced in boundless moments of ebullient survival; felt like a freshly born infant; bouncing incessantly in the lap of its mother, 

When my love was on your shoulders; it admired your indefatigably perseverance to be the absolute best; uninhibitedly lending your shoulders to the service of all humanity, 

When my love was on your hands; it intricately traced the enigmatic lines of destiny on your impeccable palms; bonding with their philanthropic spirit for centuries unprecedented, 

When my love was on your chest; it coalesced perpetually with your passionately thundering heart; utterly spell bound by the irrefutably righteous voice of your conscience, 

When my love was on your belly; it titillated itself beyond the boundaries of untamed control; as you swished your ravenous visage; to ignite fireballs of yearning in the morbidly dwindling night, 

When my love was on your legs; it relentlessly marched towards the kingdom of goodness; pulverizing all diabolical demons which came its way, 

When my love was on your reflection; it perennially felt the richest possession alive; embracing all on this Universe; as a united breeze of blissful existence, 

And when my love was on your feet; it became your immortal slave; not only for this birth; but for infinite more life's and death you were destined to breathe; you 
were definite to come. 


Your Kiss; was like sensuous droplets of fresh rain water; magnificently caressing the petals of the majestically blossoming rose, 

Your Kiss; was like the marvelously young fledglings pecking on their mothers compassionately silken breast; enveloping my frigidly trembling countenance
with the warmth of miraculously Omniscient togetherness, 

Your Kiss; was like untamed streaks of flamboyant thunder in fathomless sky; igniting sparks of unparalleled enchantment on every step that I nimbly
transgressed, 

Your Kiss; was like a splendidly burgeoning inferno of everlasting happiness; engulfing even the most traumatically anguished cranny of my life with
unfathomably unending triumph, 

Your Kiss; was like an avalanche of unsurpassably augmenting yearning; triggering me to take a countless more births to relish its wonderful softness again and
again, 

Your Kiss; was like a mirror which solely reflected the mesmerizing entrenchment of resplendent paradise; blissfully inundating even the most famished pore of my existence with unbelievably gorgeous exultation, 

Your Kiss; was like a fairy dancing tirelessly in the aisles of tantalizing graciousness; painting the lugubriously remorseful canvas of my life with; vivaciously magical colors of symbiotic existence, 

Your Kiss; was like a romantically poignant expedition that never ended; uncontrollably metamorphosing me more and more into a cloud of insatiable fantasy; as the Sun rolled down the hills, 

Your Kiss; was like a relentlessly marching unflinching soldier who never knew what it was to look back; perpetuating each element of my bedraggled visage with the vibrantly charismatic melody of enchanting life, 

Your Kiss; was like an uninhibited bird soaring through the endless cosmos; celestially liberating even the most insidiously lambasted vein of body; into
a cloudburst of limitless ecstasy, 
Your Kiss; was like gregariously unfurling dewdrop of beauty; handsomely transpiring me to blend with even the most mercurial rudiments of my past time, 

Your Kiss; was like the royally galloping panther with a mischievous smile; making me gorgeously reminisce all my moments of exuberant childhood; flirtatiously
rollicking in the caverns of timelessness, 

Your Kiss; was like unassailable flames of blazingly crimson fire in the heart of the deadened lake; irrefutably making me realize that life was to be led each moment like a prince; no matter what adversities did acrimoniously stab me in my way, 

Your Kiss; was like the vividly eclectic feathers of the ravishingly titillating peacock; superbly deluging the fabric of my morbidly vengeful life with inimitable dexterity and astoundingly undefeated charm, 

Your Kiss; was like the most unshakably heavenly walls of sparkling truth that spawned on this gigantic Universe; Omnipotently substituting even the most
parsimonious fraction of lechery in my demeanor with the mantra of humanitarian righteousness, 

Your Kiss; was like an ebulliently tangy wave which never crashed; transporting every pore of my flesh higher and higher into the clouds of exotic ecstasy as each instant rapidly unleashed into a wholesome minute, 

Your Kiss; was like a priceless forest of aristocratically panoramic breath; perpetually
ensuring that the beats of my existence forever blended with the chapters of proliferation; even as hell blended with earth at every step, 

And Your Kiss; was like the ingratiating cry of immortal  love; unbelievably emancipating me of all my loneliness in mystical life; making me experience the
everlasting shine of the divine; on even the most disparagingly obfuscated path of mine. 


Perhaps it's not the time and place
for you to meet your ladies face
sometime when the day is fair
you'll look up she'll be there

There's nothing left for you to do
her eyes will be full of you
your heart will never thirst again
she will also be your friend


Just be patient wait and see
fate will play you a symphony.

Take bread away from me, if you wish,
take air away, but
do not take from me your laughter.

Do not take away the rose,
the lance flower that you pluck,
the water that suddenly
bursts forth in joy,
the sudden wave
of silver born in you.


My struggle is harsh and I come back
with eyes tired
at times from having seen
the unchanging earth,
but when your laughter enters
it rises to the sky seeking me
and it opens for me all
the doors of life.

My love, in the darkest
hour your laughter
opens, and if suddenly
you see my blood staining
the stones of the street,
laugh, because your laughter
will be for my hands
like a fresh sword.

Next to the sea in the autumn,
your laughter must raise
its foamy cascade,
and in the spring, love,
I want your laughter like
the flower I was waiting for,
the blue flower, the rose
of my echoing country.


Laugh at the night,
at the day, at the moon,
laugh at the twisted
streets of the island,
laugh at this clumsy
boy who loves you,
but when I open
my eyes and close them,
when my steps go,
when my steps return,
deny me bread, air,
light, spring,
but never your laughter
for I would die. 


In unfathomable providence
you send your holy angels to guard us.
You hear our supplication as we cry, 
‘Defend us by your protection’.

Happy the man who does not linger
in the way of the sinners.
Joyful is the one, who takes delight

The way of the wicked leads  to doom.
Like the winnowed chaff in the wind
they shall be driven away.


Plant yourself beside the flowing waters.
Your leaves shall never fade. 


Daily, each pens the story
Of his own life: 
Letter by letter, 
Word by word.
Phrase by phrase, 
Sentence by sentence.
And page by page.


One chapter at a time—
Paragraph by paragraph, 
And line by line.

What will your story be? 
That of triumph and victory, 
Or one of defeat and agony? 

It matters not
The road you must trod, 
Nor the hand that you are dealt.
You are given the power
To determine your fate, 
And by such freedom of choice, 
You navigate.
Thus, you become captain
Of your own fate. 


Your lips are like feathers
  parted by words.
I feel their brush on my neck.
My toes grip.
My spine coils.
I hold my breath, my voice escapes.
A chill and a flame.
I open my eyes. 


Why do we all love nature so much 
Are we so jealous of her perfect hold on life? 
As man lost his way to the in-touch
In touch with love's perfect path? 
For I, no, I feel am the lion king free with 
Love and family that I was born for with, 
Until I surely die. 


I lay in an awake dream in-touch with reality thinking
Each day from thy love's cup I'm for ever drinking, 
If love could be measured in gold
Then I am on earth I'm told

As I wake up your beauty
Your eyes reassure, 
Your aroma's whirlpool holds me

Your comfort untold, 
Your lips devour me and spit me  
Tis' you only to my mind did bring
The thought that I am



Your love for me was not like the disloyally changing shape of the Moon; which blatantly metamorphosed its pearly body at the onset of every night, 
Infact I have profound pride in stating; that it was like the resplendent blanket of shimmering stars which shone for countless decades; illuminating my gloomy
household with enchanting light.

Your love for me was not like the tumultuous storm; which devoured even the minutest of entity in its thunderous swirl, 
In fact I have profound pride in stating; that it was like the delectable draught of wind; which arose every evening; mystically tingling the camouflage of dense leaves with its dainty charm and grace.

Your love for me was not like the poignantly burning candle; which diminished wholesomely; a few minutes after ferociously igniting into a ball of flames, 
In fact I have profound pride in stating; that it was like the fire which burnt unrelentingly towards the sky; becoming more and more passionate as the pinnacle
of darkness encroached every space.

Your love for me was not like the swanky bottle of expensive scent; which started to rot away soon after initially flooding every bit of scorched atmosphere, 
In fact I have profound pride in stating; that it was like the stupendously fragrant lotus; which spread its essence without distinction; captivated me for many births yet to unveil in the aura of its enigmatic redolence.

Your love for me was not like the callous bird mother; who deserted her children a few days after they had hatched from the egg; and after adeptly teaching them to fly high, 
Infact I have profound pride in stating; that it was like the human mother; who harnessed and nourished her baby for marathon years even after he attained maturity; catered to the most inconspicuous of his demand till the time she found herself on her inevitable deathbed.

Your love for me was not like pelting drops of violent rain; which gave just momentary pleasure to my flesh and then left me dry and mourning as the blistering
Sun crept up in the sky, 
Infact I have profound pride in stating that; it was like the colossal ocean with piquantly escalating waves; which provided warmth and rejuvenation to my dirty body; at the unleashing of dawn every morning.


Your love for me was not like a sleazy television commercial; which sent ravishing chills down my spine as the instant I viewed it; and then left me longing for more as the boring news came by, 
Infact I have profound pride in stating that; it was like the mesmerizing fable that had an unprecedented impact on my destiny; bequeathed a moral to my life.

Your love for me was not like slippery granules of sand; which seductively caressed my skin for fraction of seconds; and then unavoidably trickled onto the boiling soil, 
Infact I have profound pride in stating that; it was like the century old Banyan tree which had its roots firmly impregnated in ground; was almost invincible to dismantle even when the entire army tried to tear it down.

Your love for me was not like the swashbuckling aircraft which transported the passenger at electric speeds from one destination to another; made him feast
on the magnificent cocoon of white clouds as he sipped wine seated on the plush upholstery; before eventually leaving him to crawl miserably towards his destination
on naked feet, 
Infact I have profound pride in stating that; it was like the divine fairy wandering in the cosmos; who inundated my senses every unfurling second with all the pleasure and fantasy that existed on this planet.

And your love for me was not like the throbbing heart which palpitated beyond the point of no control at one instant, and relinquished breath the other; abandoning
me in a condition of complete disbelief and disarray; 
Infact I have profound pride in stating that; it was like the soul which was timeless; which would continue to live for unfathomable number of years even after the last entity on this earth had died; which strangulated me entirely in its perpetual grip; which gave my life a new beginning every time I felt I was dead.


I want to be close to you like Mercury to see your full glow
and brightness of your intimacy

I see you like a Venus because of your unsurpassed beauty
and your unfathomable; the abysmal kind of love

You revolve like the Earth that gives a magnetic kind of force
to touch the core and mantle of our hearts

I see your ardent desires like a red Mars to fight as war to cover
and protect me

You give a gigantic precious tenderness and enormously
unselfish affections like a Jupiter

You give me snowball rings like Saturn that gives remembrance all beautiful
things that we had been in the atmosphere of treasure memories

Your warmhearted axis that tilts on the rocky core of my life
is like in a deep ocean of Uranus that clasps me with grasping arms

You are like the sea as Neptune that your gentle flows
like clouds that drift my soul


On a very far and infinite distance from your presence, 
you are like a Pluto moon that travels with me
and you are always there for me orbiting within
Your Wonderful and Marvelous Love. 


Your love 
knots
are tied 
around
my heart

Holding me 
securely
under their
spell

Threads of
gold and 
silver
have spun
a lovely
web

Attaching
themselves
to my heart
strings

refusing to
let go
leaving my
heart tied
with your
love knots.

You're out of the way of failure
and on the path to success
Because of your Mother
You have a heavy wind
pushing at your back
into the best person you can 
ever be
that person is
your Mother
You have not
achieved your greatness
all by yourself
you would have done much less
and become much less
without the motivation
of your Mother
When you've won the victory
and run the victory lap, one
very special person will be
there running with you, 
that person is your Mother
In life, there will be
no better friend
than your Mother


Let us sleep for a while, 
On the lap of peace, 
It holds our eye lids, 
The darkness never wraps, 
The hungry flesh, very hot, 
Always needs the fire to blaze, 
The fast neurons and their appetite, 
Can’t be controlled by any amount, 
Of fine, fast and road side cuisines, 

Let us have the rest, 
On the lap of the peace, 
we hope that it is not kept, 
On the top of the hot plate, 
Peace neither steams nor is frozen, 
To keep our seeking heart with liaison, 
we think peace may be very gentle, 
And it does not have any conflicts, 
With peace of many kinds and varieties, 

Peace is near the horizon, 
We may not reach it in our many more births, 
What is peace? where does it dwell? 
Has anyone experienced holding their wealth? 
Has anyone experienced saving their good deeds? 
Has anyone felt though out their life? 
What is peace? What a blessing that is! 
‘Peace be with you all, Herds and Virus’
we want to rest for a while on the lap of peace.

Naked and Vulnerable, 
I lie before you
For you to behold me
With your naked eyes-

Beautiful and Ugly
I lie before you
For you to assess me
With your naked eyes-

Drenched in Love
I lie before you
For you to reciprocate
With your naked eyes-

Doused in Passion
I lie before you
For you to arouse me
With your naked eyes


Lying before you, 
Asking
To propitiate her
With his heavenly body
And naked eyes-

As you devour me
And savour me
In the heat and the sweat
Of our spiritual ‘coming’
I transfix my gaze
On your naked eyes-

When you smile back
In opulent ecstasy
I feel so blissful
And so peaceful
In this shameless abandonment
To your naked eyes-


I can remember those yestermonths of the spring
And I love them
I can remember those lovelit nights
And I lament inside me silent

I bless your present days of oblivion
Though my heart weathering


Starting from five yesteryears
Still I have been painting your smile
On the wave of every waters
Painting your kisses on every apple
Painting your cascade hair in winds

And in my fist, I hold a sigh tight
That's your name


On the canvas of my heart
Jigsaw of bits of love
Masterpiece of numbers 

Lines drawn puffed into the air
Like king Solomon to the giants
On the sweet hands of fairies
To the wind


From under the earth
Never done before
I moved earth back

With time
From the lips of dove
With the power of now

Of puzzle so simple
I found your number
I had torn in anguish

With as many odds
Evens had given way
A piece of modern art

My gift of love
The collage I made
If you can read it deep


Said in love backed up
By evidence of your life
can be life givingall the past, 
flowing viens, to dreams
haunting nightmares
say you quit
the one you love
trying.
shes feeling the pain
wondering asking herself questions 
why his love.
scared for his past nightmares
he wanted it
her love, liked doing them
girlfriend against total hate
hard to love, sorry.
hes ashamed
shes hurt
forever this pain will never decade


Clouds rush the cathedral of your sky
While the sun pours over the meadows of sleepy ferns
Filling the atmosphere with more air
Autumn trees are running thread bare
While he dancing birch weave their magic
Looking for answers you walk your sacred path 
You are a sovereign nation unto yourself
Bearing no sorrow nor wrath
'Tis yours, 'tis yours-'tis your bounty-your wealth
Consecrated in the divine of your sacred
The light shines forth from your soul
And, i finally understand your true need
'Tis your journey to finally feel whole


You ask me what I like
About your Poetry? 

Everything about it
Is so Beautiful, 
So Wonderful, 
So Ethereal ~
As the Lover’s
Fantasy


The way you dedicate
Your poems to me
In your dreams and
Reveries of
Fantasising me-

I feel Beautiful, 
Wonderful and
Ethereal ~
Just the way you
Want me to be! 

Your poems beautify me
Your fantasies edify me-
You win me over with your
Renderings of romantic poetry.


I am all yours-
Your poetry seems to say.
Let this not be a Fantasy.
Hope one day, I’ll be yours
Truly yours, only yours, 
Forever yours


Life is a Fiction and a Fantasy.

May be, I’ll remain yours, 
Not only through this Life.
But in soul, spirit and matter
For aeons together-
Beyond death, beyond time.
You and I merged into
The Oneness of Eternity. 


I hate all you people in your perfect lives
With you perfect family with husbands and wives 
With your perfect parents and your perfect past
You people and your perfect happiness always lasts

While you people sit at home next to your warm fire
My very imperfect life dangles by the smallest wire
While you’re perfect parents taught and took care of you
My defective mom did her own thing and left us two 

In your perfect childhood, you played with friends
Well I had no time, when it’s upon me my little sister depends
No friends, no fun, no laughter, no nothing none
If I didn’t do it, nothing would get done

In your perfect families you trust and worship the lord
Well he didn’t stop me from being beat with an extension cord
He sat and watched my father and older brother die 
Knowing he could stop it if he would only try 

I hate your faultlessly perfect wonderful lives because mine isn’t
I want your paradise instead of this god forsaken prison
I wish I could just end my life and break my restraints 
But then how would that solve all my complaints 

Your perfect life is filled with all the happiness I never had
Now ill make sure that I make your happy life somehow sad


Your Riches—taught me—Poverty.
Myself—a Millionaire
In little Wealths, as Girls could boast
Till broad as Buenos Ayre—

You drifted your Dominions—
A Different Peru—
And I esteemed All Poverty
For Life's Estate with you—

Of Mines, I little know—myself—
But just the names, of Gems—
The Colors of the Commonest—
And scarce of Diadems—

Her Glory I should know—
But this, must be a different Wealth—
To miss it—beggars so—

I'm sure 'tis India—all Day—
To those who look on You—
Without a stint—without a blame,
Might I—but be the Jew—

I'm sure it is Golconda—
Beyond my power to deem—
To have a smile for Mine—each Day,
How better, than a Gem!

At least, it solaces to know
That there exists—a Gold—
Altho' I prove it, just in time
Its distance—to behold—

Its far—far Treasure to surmise—
And estimate the Pearl—
That slipped my simple fingers through—
While just a Girl at School. 


I have spoken long enough
I have spoken well enough
Now let me be silent
And see how Silence speaks
Hear the words unspoken
For you could never speak
And whenever I asked you
All I could ever hear, was: 
Your Silence-

Yes, that very Silence of yours
Which sucked all my life out
making me feel miserable
day in and day out
Still I kept holding on, 
hoping on and hanging on-
If you could ever speak 

Yet you never spoke up
Instead, offered me a challenge
A challenge to a broken heart? 
A challenge to a defeated soul? 
Oh! How Ruthless you could be-

And still you ever want me
To keep hearing your silence
And make some meaning of it all
I told you long before
Silence never works for me
I am a woman of words-
It might work well for you
So be it, my love-
If that is what you call ‘friendship’

Let you be silent 
And me be too
And we can still remain ‘friends’
For if you speak 
And I speak too
Who knows, One day
We might become foes-
And I would rather die 
A Friend of yours
Than choose to be a Foe.


'It's possible to compose a poem with more quietness than the silence of yours.'


Beneath this title
My desires are eager to draw
A sign of full pause. 

To meet with me 
From an unknown place 
You send your scented image 

Behind the cover of beauty 
You can not hide 
From dawn to twilight 
I hear the sound of your footsteps 

At today’s midnight 
Your secret messenger came 
In disguise of wind 
And called me up 
At my door step he handed over me 
Your sweet message of love 

Since that time 
In the middle of my heart 
Delight comes like the electromagnetic waves
Spraying around your sweet smell
Whenever I open my internet


Trust your smile.
It can be strong
as a thunderbolt
and even more: 
It does not set on fire
a simmering angry soul. 


The splendor of a sunset that energizes my emotions
The radiance of a rose that refreshes the core of my being
The tranquil tenderness of a dazzling dancing dripping dew drop
The pure magnificence of the midnight moon massaging my mood
The lifter of my spirit and the healer of my hurting heart
Greater than gravity, more majestic than the morning -your smile


Your smiles, 
give me feathers, 
my wings flutter to soar, 
your smiles shine like rainbow, 
growing after pleasant rains.
I am feeling your breaths, inhailing  heavenly musks, 
I am sinking in your smiles, 
deep blue and clear waters, 
and  fresh roses with dew, 
your smiles make me to know.
how my vigours grow. 


My dreams are resonant with your melodies
You come to my bed to sing
your choicest melodies.

Your songs become stars
that twinkle in my darkness.

Oh what a joy that you are by me
near my bed when I sleep.


Your spirit fights
Against
The changes 
During ageing
Your flesh
As a bird flies
Against the wind
Until it gets
A hurt wing. 


We walk around on this pluvious day
In remembrance of the strong hearted
Whom everyday fought a great battle
But this disease is why they departed.

We gather with tears to a ceremonial reminiscence
Listening to the lost voices in the wind
Melancholy songs are sung to those we miss
Uniting us to words so mellifluous.

Candles are lit to remind us of souls
Who so bravely overlooked their world with a smile
We stand in a one minute silence
Where your spirit enters my mind for a while.

I stare into the candle and see more than a flame
Feel more than warmth, feel more than sadness
I see an energy conflating with mine, a smile with a smile
A tear with a tear, a light with a sickness I yearn for madness.

We sit and lay conversing with one another
About little things in life, about interests, sharing stories
But when the chatter dies down and my heart feels kind
I can feel your beautiful spirit
Walk freely in my mind. 


Whilst lying close to you, 
as I caress your 
silken hair 
nor, Volitare
T'would be a treat, to write 
about you my sweet
and the love
that we now share
              ~*~
Our love hast grown and it
has blossomed
as the flowers do in spring
Our joining hearts are so 
close, as the vine 
to a rose they cling 
               ~*~
Divine are thine eye's that
sparkle and shine
Heaven blessed the day that
we met
I knew from the start when 
you melted my heart
Loving you I would have no
regret 
                 ~*~
You thrill me with each warm
and tender kiss
As I close mine eye's, I still
see you there
Each breath that I take your
essence fills the air
                  ~*~
I can't hold back the way that
I feel for thee
Being near you is so heavenly
and my muse and I pray each
day, that the wonders 
of our love shan't ever go away
Your sweet love I could not ever
bare to lose  ~


The crumbling world
Bloody bricks
Falling dreams
Wicked beatings with sticks
Looking to the skies
Empty blue of no purpose
Looking to the ground
Side walk with no feet
I’m alone
Crumbling doubts
And he takes my hand
Holds me tights
This last breath
This last moment
I’m only stuck in your time


Talk to me
If you can
Read me 
If you could

Save me
From my loneliness
Hug me 
with your poems

Convince me
with your songs
Love me
with your words

Find me
Through the Rhymes
And tell me
Your time please


Your ugly
and your mom
dresses you funny
Your ugly
and does your
mom still dress you.

I`m pretty now
and don`t need
my mom to dress me
I`m pretty now
and dress myself.

I`m ugly now
because I dress
myself 
I`m ugly now
you can`t blame
my mom no more.

Your ugly because your
mom still dresses you
I`m ugly now because I
dress myself. 


I was profoundly enchanted by her; relishing her soft caress till times immemorial, 

I felt privileged by her presence; everytime she drifted with me standing in open  mouthed consternation, 

I stared at her unrelentingly all night; even as the last person on this planet had gone off to sleep, 

I admired her relentlessly till my last breath; although my voice had become horrendously hoarse; and my tongue incorrigibly refrained to swish an inch further, 

I kissed her infinite number of times; with smooch of mine; igniting unfathomable desires in me; to do it all over again, 

I was drowning in her honey coated eyes; with the mascara in her lashes casting over me a spell impossible to break, 

I clasped my hands securely over her demeanor; blocking every possible source of acerbic light striking her dainty skin, 

I pacified all the uncouth pangs of hunger arising in my stomach; as I was lost in cognizing my destiny in the intricate lines of my palms, 

I whistled incessantly as she glided by; flooding her ears with the inferno blazing in my tunes, 

I sprinkled golden dust on her body; as she overwhelmingly enjoyed the silken powder; voluptuously tickling her skin beyond the point of no control, 
 
I was simply mesmerized by the titillating cascade of her hair; and the grace embedded in her form; made me stumble; even before I put down my first foot to walk, 

I compared her visage with the angels dancing daintily in the heavens; with the ravishing fragrance that diffused from her persona; putting me in a state of immortal bliss, 

I craved all night and day for her enchanting touch; the vividly painted nails on her fingers; circulating at electric speeds through each pore of my skin, 

I slept even on a blanket of acrimonious thorns; as I was completely lost in the essence of what she spoke; kept iterating the same words in my mind; till the time it had eradicated all other traces of memory, 

I commenced to cry worse than the newly born child; even if I missed her presence for less than a fraction of a second, 

I ran as she ran; walked as she walked; halted when she halted; ate when she ate; emulated every action of hers; howsoever much it might have seemed worthless
and inconspicuous to the outside world, 

I emptied all the blood running through my veins; even as she uttered the slightest of scream; even as just a  small fragment of her flesh was ripped apart a trifle by the blowing wind, 

And I know by now you must be burning in the aisles of jealously sweetheart! But let me tell you that there was not any rhyme or reason for you to do so darling; as the person I have been mentioning in all the previous lines; was none other than your velvety shadow. 





But I forget what to write
 heart beat runs  fast 
pen does not move
only  the image I envisage 
of your coming at my door step 
with a sweet sound of your footsteps  

you enter and sit upon the crown 
what an elegant pose! 
slowly your hand moves over the mouse 
after refreshing your machine 
you   click on  my name
with  all beauty and  grace 
for a while I hold my breath 
and wait to see what you say 
first you smile then you type great 
leaving me behind  blushingly  red.


I used to hear your voice, 
Clearly in my mind, 
Now I hear my own, 
Tricking me, it’s mine.

I used to hear your song, 
Sing inside my heart, 
Love songs and ballads, 
But now that we’re apart.

I can’t hear a thing, 
Just my loneliness, 
A silent cold darkness, 
Taunting me, oh yes.

Telling me I’m crazy, 
To have loved so much, 
Given myself completely, 
Given in to your touch.

There is no bitterness, 
My own voice now tricks me, 
Just emptiness remains, 
Where your voice used to be. 

Give me the pleasure I need
I’ve had enough of pain, 
I need to hear your voice
seducing me gently

Love is not what I’ve got
in every step of my life
I need to hear your voice
loving me gently

Countless times I’ve asked myself
Who am I, What am I for
I need to hear your voice again
reassuring me gently

Come and make love to me
Let’s lose ourselves in frenzy
I need to hear your searching voice
calling for my name gently

Yes – that magnificently serene voice of yours, 
warm, gentle, soft and seductive. 
calming me within magical moments
Your embrace gives me eternal surety.


Near
The sound of your voice

The naked skin of your body
Still has a baby smell.

Your words flood the space
With love.

I stare into that space

Rolling seconds back
Rolling seconds before 


And back
Again


To be only yours. 

RAINBOW 



Amazing lady you..
like you has never been..
like him has never seen..
and no one will know, 

At night at the sea..
when there you will be.. 
in the wind you and who, 

you will dance with the wind
when the start never end 
with the waves both flow, 

dropp me back to the rain 
keep with you the Love's chain 
then back me to the bow, 

the amazing one are you. 

water me and the buds. 
teach the buds how to grow, 

Your words like the touch, 
your touch like the dew, 

Keep on singing every day 
toward you open the way 
then the feeling let it glow, 

keep on raising rate of beats 
then the raising keep slow.


BROKEN HEARTS I TREAT

n your breathing let me live 
let me come, let me go..
let the sadness.. 

me to blow, 

how the chance became dance..
how the arts of the parts 
let me see and you show..

words from the heart 
from the feeling i will sew
 The wondrous one are you. 


I have seemingly missed your words of love, 
Those  words that were written in the  sand 
And erased by the first wave.
Do you remember, my love? 
I have enclosed  them  hermetically   
With  that last kiss.
And, after that, 
Another kiss 
And  another exotic beach 
And  another feeling,  autumnal feeling, 
Of another ostensible seemingly love
Fulfilled my nothingness. 
Among corals and shells, 
Dried by the winds of the sea, 
I  awake in  following  my  lost steps, 
Taken by  the waves 
And redirected  to the great unknown in the sea, 
That great eternal.
I  still love you, 
I love you more, miss you more.
Yes, I still miss  you
And  I realize  that  all I can  do now 
Is to lodge near the  moan of  the sea sand, 
Which feels like  a silk slipped  worn-out  dress, 
When I touch it.
And  slantingly  I elect the oblivion, 
When 
I want to kiss  again and again
Your gray-haired temple, 
But, in reverting,   I receive only 
The kiss  of our child


There I go
Into that
Bed of 
Yours-
To lose
Myself, 
Into that
Body of
Yours


What I feel, I can’t express, 
And no words can tell.
When you have your arms around me, 
I’d care less if the world fell.
To be enclosed in your embrace, 
Is joy I’ve never known.
And there is nothing sweeter than, 
Your kiss that’s all my own.
Whenever we are together, 
Don’t care what we do or why.
Because just to be around you, 
Makes me feel like I could fly.
But I fear you’ll never know, 
How much I truly care.
I hope this helps you understand, 
As I lay my love bare. 


I spent the afternoon exploring
As much of you as I could
Feeding on your flesh
With my lips and tongue
Illuminated my soul


We both glistened this morning
As we crossed over the threshold of our desires
I had now become yours
You held me close and told me to release my fears
You would be my dream-catcher


Yesterday we didn’t exist
Yet I allowed you to seduce me
And I don’t often fall
And I don’t often give up myself
To be led by the moment

Your scent, your taste
So exotic
The paradigm of many cultures
That you can call your own
Confident and sensitive
In equal parts

I averted my eyes
When I saw you rise before me
A schoolboy’s wanderlust
Taken to new heights
Cursory words fumbled over my tongue
As I was drawn to you

You didn’t resist
And you didn’t dismiss
My initial attempts
To brush up against you
To feel the power of your aura
To bathe in you’re radiant glow

You entered my heart
First as a silhouette of brilliance
While the setting sun behind you
Framed for me an image I’ll never let go


Without any effort
You enveloped me
The deeper I got within you
Secure from the world
Beyond these red sheets

You took me in your arms
As I took you in my heart
How long does a one night stand last
When you fall in love? 


I want to love you
For more than what you are
I want to love you like a dream
I’ve always had

You are giving
Without asking in turn
You are giving
When you, yourself still hurt


I see and touch your scars
I kiss them gently
Knowing that I can’t bring back
What was

I raise my eyes from your stomach
Find you smiling down on me
I am here to help you heal
If that is what you want from me


A whip cracks in the wood, and cattle low
And through the underbrush are heard to
Crash heavily. Leaves rustle. Snowdrops show
Their blue heads here and there. A sudden, furtive

Wind starts to blow, and ashen clouds are swept
Across the skies, a cool, fresh rain presaging-
The heart grieves and is glad that life is, strangely,
Vast like the steppe and empty like the steppe. 


MUCH did I rage when young,
Being by the world oppressed,
But now with flattering tongue
It speeds the parting guest. 

If love thou hast for me, not hate,
Arise and find a younger mate;
For I no longer will abide
Where youth and age lie side by side. 


I bought a dishmop-- 
having no daughter-- 
for they had twisted 
fine ribbons of shining copper 
about white twine 
and made a tousled head 
of it, fastened it 
upon a turned ash stick 
slender at the neck 
straight, tall-- 
when tied upright 
on the brass wallbracket 
to be a light for me 
and naked 
as a girl should seem 
to her father. 


David the immortal-willed,
Youth a thousand thousand times
Slain, but not once killed,
Swaggering again today 
In the old contemptuous way;

Leaning backward from your thigh
Up against the tinselled bar—
Dust and ashes! is it you?
Laughing, boasting, there you are! 
First we hardly recognized you
In your modern avatar.

Soldier, rifle, brown khaki—
Is your blood as happy so?
Where’s your sling or painted shield, 
Helmet, pike or bow?
Well, you’re going to the wars—
That is all you need to know.

Graybeards plotted. They were sad.
Death was in their wrinkled eyes. 
At their tables—with their maps,
Plans and calculations—wise
They all seemed; for well they knew
How ungrudgingly Youth dies.

At their green official baize 
They debated all the night
Plans for your adventurous days
Which you followed with delight,
Youth in all your wanderings,
David of a thousand slings

Youth is fortune, 
And like a fortune it is spent.
But one must do so wisely, 
Unless they will lament
When looking back ruefully
On what has not been done 
In the years that were given, 
When one's youth, then, was spun. 


Youth of the nation is everyone in its time and  place.

Youth of the nation is having fun even when your down

Youth of the nation is when you help someone  of something that is called for.

Youth of the nation is us the people of the world no matter what the age is young or old.


            We Are The Youth Of The Nation


How can you
Smooch a guy
Who rims you? 

It’s so yucky! 
I can never do.

broken & beautiful

at the end
of our garden

stands guard
over our love.

A humble bumble bee
explores the diety

as with
the dying light

she is now
this

shattered statuete

now
the living

goddess.


Where wail the waters in their flaw
A spectre wanders to and fro,
 And evermore that ghostly shore
Bemoans the heir of Yvytot.

Sometimes, when, like a fleecy pall,
The mists upon the waters fall,
 Across the main float shadows twain
That do not heed the spectre's call.

The king his son of Yvytot
Stood once and saw the waters go
 Boiling around with hissing sound
The sullen phantom rocks below.

And suddenly he saw a face
Lift from that black and seething place--
 Lift up and gaze in mute amaze
And tenderly a little space,

A mighty cry of love made he--
No answering word to him gave she,
 But looked, and then sunk back again
Into the dark and depthless sea.

And ever afterward that face,
That he beheld such little space,
 Like wraith would rise within his eyes
And in his heart find biding place.

So oft from castle hall he crept
Where mid the rocks grim shadows slept,
 And where the mist reached down and kissed
The waters as they wailed and wept.

The king it was of Yvytot
That vaunted, many years ago,
 There was no coast his valiant host
Had not subdued with spear and bow.

For once to him the sea-king cried:
"In safety all thy ships shall ride
  An thou but swear thy princely heir
Shall take my daughter to his bride.

"And lo, these winds that rove the sea
Unto our pact shall witness be,
 And of the oath which binds us both
Shall be the judge 'twixt me and thee!"

Then swore the king of Yvytot
Unto the sea-king years ago,
 And with great cheer for many a year
His ships went harrying to and fro.

Unto this mighty king his throne
Was born a prince, and one alone--
 Fairer than he in form and blee
And knightly grace was never known.

But once he saw a maiden face
Lift from a haunted ocean place--
 Lift up and gaze in mute amaze
And tenderly a little space.

Wroth was the king of Yvytot,
For that his son would never go
 Sailing the sea, but liefer be
Where wailed the waters in their flow,

Where winds in clamorous anger swept,
Where to and fro grim shadows crept,
 And where the mist reached down and kissed
The waters as they wailed and wept.

So sped the years, till came a day
The haughty king was old and gray,
 And in his hold were spoils untold
That he had wrenched from Norroway.

Then once again the sea-king cried:
"Thy ships have harried far and wide;
 My part is done--now let thy son
Require my daughter to his bride!"

Loud laughed the king of Yvytot,
And by his soul he bade him no--
 "I heed no more what oath I swore,
For I was mad to bargain so!"

Then spake the sea-king in his wrath:
"Thy ships lie broken in my path!
 Go now and wring thy hands, false king!
Nor ship nor heir thy kingdom hath!

"And thou shalt wander evermore
All up and down this ghostly shore,
 And call in vain upon the twain
That keep what oath a dastard swore!"

The king his son of Yvytot
Stood even then where to and fro
 The breakers swelled--and there beheld
A maiden face lift from below.

"Be thou or truth or dream," he cried,
"Or spirit of the restless tide,
But I would have thee to my bride


Then spake the maiden: "Come with me
Unto a palace in the sea,
 For there my sire in kingly ire
Requires thy king his oath of thee!"

Gayly he fared him down the sands
And took the maiden's outstretched hands;
 And so went they upon their way
To do the sea-king his commands.

The winds went riding to and fro
And scourged the waves that crouched below,
 And bade them sing to a childless king
The bridal song of Yvytot.

So fell the curse upon that shore,
And hopeless wailing evermore
 Was the righteous dole of the craven soul
That heeded not what oath he swore.

An hundred ships went down that day
All off the coast of Norroway,
 And the ruthless sea made mighty glee
Over the spoil that drifting lay.

The winds went calling far and wide
To the dead that tossed in the mocking tide:
 "Come forth, ye slaves! from your fleeting graves
And drink a health to your prince his bride!"

Where wail the waters in their flow
A spectre wanders to and fro,
 But nevermore that ghostly shore
Shall claim the heir of Yvytot.

Sometimes, when, like a fleecy pall,
The mists upon the waters fall,
 Across the main flit shadows twain
That do not heed the spectre's call.

Nothing can substitute the touch of hand
the panacea of your muscle ache-ness

DEEP TISSUE, DE-STRESS

               Feel the soft touch like heaven
               Soothing to your twistedknots
               Slowly gliding palm penetrates down
               To your ached muscle tissues
               Absorb from daily stressful affairs;

               Petrissage kneads nodules of mortality

               Along meridian trigger points
               Striking like a slow-mo  bullets
               BANG! BANG! BANG!

               By the well-matched zoning techniques
               By the channel system of fainted glands
               There

               Glide stressed thighs
               Gently, please, gently
               And
               The numb soul is dancing now
               With the flow of rhythmic

A function of  thoughts
For pleasant and unpleasant 
Is our emotion. 

From Africa is the zebra.
Nowhere else does it roam
Innately, wild and free—
But in Africa, its home.

It feasts with the wildebeest, 
And migrates with the same—
Steering clear of lions there, 
Which sees it as fair game.

But, oh, the lovely zebra
With its stripes unique, 
Brings a certain flair to life.
‘Tis nature's own mystique. 


Zenith of Love

The stir you've created
Love has inflated
Am I dreaming
Watch the light beaming
Feel you're  beside me
Oh your love has tied me
My heart is on fire
Burns in your desire
Oh stop teasing me
Just play with me
Bless me with your touch
Oh I need you so much
Listen to your zeal
Which only I can feel
Caress me cuddle me
In your arms huddle me
With music of your fingers
My body is your singer
Adorn me with your lips
Hurt  with your nips
Move like a fish
Play as you wish
While on your sail
Leave on me some trails
As we are allying
Our love is flying
Oh as you  unveil
I turn  more  male
Oh the rush of breaths
As I explore more depths
Expressions on your face
Invites in your embrace
More you enwrap me
Only love I can see
The act of being one
We sing  in unison
And there  you fall
Like Angel 


I can feel the smiling you
As immersed in you
And we lie together
Giving our love feathers 
"a landscape and a person walking in that landscape.
There are daunting cliffs there,
And plains glad in their way
of brown monotony. But especially
there are sinkholes, places
of sudden terror, of small circumference
and malevolent depths


"I know," she said. "When I set forth
to walk in myself, as it might be
on a fine afternoon, forgetting,
sooner or later I come to where sedge 
and clumps of white flowers, rue perhaps,
mark the bogland, and I know
there are quagmires there that can pull you
down, and sink you in bubbling mud"


"We had an old dog," he told her, "when I was a boy,
a good dog, friendly. But there was an injured spot
on his head, if you happened 
just to touch it he'd jump up yelping
and bite you. He bit a young child,
they had to take him down to the vet's and destroy him"


"No one knows where it is," she said,
"and even by accident no one touches it.
It's inside my landscape, and only I, making my way
preoccupied through my life, crossing my hills,
sleeping on green moss of my own woods,
I myself without warning touch it,
and leap up at myself -"
"- or flinch back
just in time


			"Yes, we learn that.
It's not a terror, it's pain we're talking about:
those places in us, like your dog's bruised head,
that are bruised forever, that time
never assuages, never

"Saved life packed to bag
Washed it away on the way
By zeroth time peeks


I have the
Zest for
Life

Do you? 

Yes, 
You
Surely
Do

No doubt, 
You keep

So many
Lives





O Zeus, whoe'er Thou be,
If that name please thee well,
By that I call on Thee;
For weighing all things else I fail to tell
Of any name but Zeus;
If once for all I seek
Of all my haunting, troubled thoughts a truce,
That name I still must speak. 


Hope, anything that one wants, and at 
the moment of 'hope' they do not have. 

If hope were a feeling, I would hope, 
it be one of honesty and integrity. 
I would hope it would be love and empathy. 

If hope were a food, I would hope it 
would be filled with nourishment. 

If hope were music, I would hope, it 
was the kind of music, that you loved. 

If hope were a sound, I would hope it 
would by a symphony of love. 

If hope were a religion, I would hope it 
was your religion. 


If hope were belief, then I would hope, 
that belief would be, that there is one 
Supreme Being; who is by-lingual and 
of all faiths, and all creeds and colors. 

If hope were knowledge, I would hope, 
it had patience, understanding, the 
ability of comprehending the other 
persons point of view. I would also hope, 
that it had an unquenchable thirst, 
to continue to learn by experience and 
research. 


If hope could be seen, I would hope, all 
would see, the good in their fellow man. 

If hope were a wish, I would hope 
that all your dreams, and ambitions 
came true. 

If hope were you

if hope were me, I 
would hope, we never lost sight of 
those less fortunate. I would hope 
we would never be so self-centered 
or busy, that we neglected to extend 
a helping hand, to those in need. 


If hope were a human, I would hope, that it 
realized, that if we want a better world, 
then we have to be better ourselves. 


Our kisses
eager for our lips

to create
them

almost
will themselves

into being

as if they were
kissless kisses

then change
& change again

as they become
the real thing.


all what they taught you is beyond  mind's ability to understand, 

astonished we stand while watching the humanity turning to blind, 

 while slapping the heads by heavy hands 

to awaken the deep so sleepy minds.  





A massacre is not a massacre

I don’t write poems but, in any case, poems are not poems.

Long ago, I was made to understand that Palestine was not Palestine; 
I was also informed that Palestinians were not Palestinians; 
They also explained to me that ethnic cleansing was not ethnic cleansing.
And when naive old me saw freedom fighters they patiently showed me that they were not freedom fighters, and that resistance was not resistance.
And when, stupidly, I noticed arrogance, oppression and humiliation they benevolently enlightened me so I can see that arrogance was not arrogance, oppression was not oppression, and humiliation was not humiliation.

I saw misery, racism, inhumanity and a concentration camp.
But they told me that they were experts in misery, racism, inhumanity and concentration camps and I have to take their word for it: this was not misery, racism, inhumanity and a concentration camp.
Over the years they’ve taught me so many things: invasion was not invasion, occupation was not occupation, colonialism was not colonialism and apartheid was not apartheid.

They opened my simple mind to even more complex truths that my poor brain could not on its own compute like: "having nuclear weapons" was not "having nuclear weapons, " "not having weapons of mass destruction" was "having weapons of mass destruction."

And, democracy (in the Gaza Strip)   was not democracy.
Having second class citizens (in Israel)   was democracy.


Lightning struck
I gave ear to that silence
Tagore has written –
‘Man has in him the silence of the sea’
Learnt to respect the silence
Today I am happy
Writing and reading my work.


'Protesters' don't attack police, hurt innocent people
or purposely damage property. Paid troublemakers and committed 
anarchists do- -agents who have a taste for bloody chaos, yet, whose
psychotic activities actually serve to precipitate more government 
control.  The deadly dupes of tyranny!


Zoo Break


Richard Rorty left the back forty at the age of minus one-hundred-and-nine
Leave him alone to gnaw his bone; he'll make it home in his own good time
Philosophy has let us fall right back into the mire
Let's slog around and not get saved by rapture's white-hot fire
The slow way takes years of stumbling and pain
Till the eyes of our world can open again
That stately place in Xanadu should be an empty dome
Where any sound can echo, any thought can be at home
The grand vacuum takes all images, but not to hold them
The stillness parts for all sounds, then rushes to enfold them
Humankind once found there its highest dwelling place
A formless sanctum to provide the soul with its own space
The menagerie in the basement kept its carnage out of sight
Above, the incense-tendrilled air was pierced by beams of  light
Who stirred that lower nest of hornets? 
Who riled the barnyard hordes? 
Who left the cellar door ajar? 
Who drove the geese out of their gourds? 
Now watch the clever monkeys vault along ballistic tracks
While catwalk-lemmings let off steam by doing jumping jacks
Chimps with slingshots squint their eyes and let lead pellets fly
Equations spun in lofty realms condemn the other side to die
Hairy fists are set to work by grand imaginings
The highest leaps of thought reserved for harmful fissionings
While combines of inventiveness devour a world's trees
The keenest minds are pandering, so we will sink in ease
Whole lifetimes of expertise go into arbitrage
The world outside our window starts to look like a mirage
The seedbed that nurtured us does not engage our feelings
We care more for our leverage and for our business dealings


Are these the eyes that tried one day to see the whole world whole? 
Is this the mind that made a higher consciousness its goal? 
Reflection needs a sacred space, but that's now occupied
The quiet loft above the pews is now barnyardified
So get set now and pull up stakes, prepare to meet your-'NEEDS'! 
In the feather-flyingest, fur-spittingest, eye-gougingest, 
   gut-rowelling Granddaddy of all stampedes!


   When I am gone from here, this place 
called earth, I shall miss the ones I 
hold so dear. 

I shall miss the music of the brook, 
and the symphony of the sea. 

I shall miss the meadows and the forest 
and the flowers in the spring. 

I shall miss the gray light of dawn, the blue 
sky above and the gentle breeze on a 
dark starry night. 

I shall miss the hope of tomorrow, the rush 
of the wind and the promise of love. 

I shall miss the rain from the sky, the dew 
on the grass and the softness of roses. 

I shall miss the cold breath of winter, springs 
gentle touch, the warmness of summer 
and the beauty of fall. 

I shall miss the joys in my life, the light that 
is truth and the song of the blackbird. 

I shall miss the laughter of chlidren, the 
wisdom of age and my friends at my side. 

I shall miss the silence of an early morn, 
the whisper of the wind and the peace 
in my heart. 

I shall miss all that there is about this earth. 
I shall miss you.  

life.
