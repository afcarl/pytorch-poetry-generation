Generating the Impossible: A Potlatch for Research-Creation
Keywords: art  and gift,  economy of excess, exploded gallery

Art is not  chaos
It is a composition of chaos

step 1
Prepare for Creative Chaos


Forty artists, writers, theorists from all fields  gather for a week’s  retreat in the woods. They have already met, virtually. The gathering has  been preceded by  shared readings and anticipatory discussion. The  problem: the works they will bring will populate the same event, but their disparate requirements are bound to clash. Nothing is in place but an unformatted space.

step 2
Compose an Emergent Attunement


The week’s  work will be to produce the conditions for a dynamic order to emerge from the chaos of  intended cohabitation. The  challenge: make the mutual attunement truly emergent, the product of its own

creative performance. Preconditioned, yes, but not foreseen or preconceived. Self-curating event.

step 3
Give Forth


The  time: July  8–10,  2011.  The  place: the Society for Art and Technology  (Montreal), newly expanded with built-in immersive media platforms and unpreprogrammed convivial spaces. The  mission: activate the building, and its  immediate surrounds, with the works’ dynamic coming into attunement. Invite the public to partake.

step 4
Creatively Return to Chaos


As soon as the attunement has  emerged, blow it asunder as creatively as it built itself up. A “free radical”—a latter-day trickster figure—will be loosed upon the event to joyously scramble the emergent order. Goal: produce a generative breakdown in such a way that the public can take a piece of the event with them when they leave.
Art is not chaos
It is a composition of chaos
Giving forth
Vision and sensation
Not foreseen, never preconceived45

Proposition 20
Proceed



good-Bye Technological Arts, hello Trees

The  previous chapter, Propositions for Thought in the Act, was written as an invitation to voyage. Its purpose was to convey a terrain collectively traveled, in preparation for a coming foray. It was addressed to fellow travelers already in the SenseLab network, and to others who might be inspired to come aboard. It was  a kind of conceptual bill  of lading attesting to what was coming in the collective baggage, not as an anchor to a particular past, but more as a flotation device for the next lap.  In  its own terms, it was a platform for relation for the open-ended continuation of a journey.

The  destination was not premapped. Unimaginable in advance, where the collaborative process could go was precisely the “impossibility” to be “generated.” The  invitation was for a collective pathfinding toward a destination that would come into being en route. In the end, less a pathfinding  than a waymaking.

We  were  fully prepared for  the open-endedness. What we  were  not prepared for  was  losing our starting point before we set  forth. The  event lost  site  of  itself. During our year  of  planning Generating the  Impossible, the Society for  Art  and Technology (SAT) crossed a  threshold we  had not anticipated. The  renovations scheduled to improve the site  and add the immersive interactive dome dubbed the SATosphere were caught in the aftereffects of the 2008 economic crisis. The  resulting budget deficit necessitated a rethinking of the SAT’s operating model. Henceforth, all activities would be  called upon to generate monetary returns. We  could still  work at the SAT in the SATosphere, but the new model required projects  that were  not fully subsidized from outside sources to earn their keep by bringing in a paying public. This  was an obvious problem for a project meant to explore the gift  as a living critique of the neoliberal economy. The  SAT’s earlier proposition was  that we “explode the gallery,” creating flows that might open the site of art to cacophonous interventions poised between modes of address (the conference paper), display (the art  exhibition), and collaboration (the participatory installation), as well as opening it onto its outside, reconnecting it to its urban surroundings. Now there would be no “explosion.” 

The site’s modalities were  given in advance, and any experimentation would have to happen within its domed structure. Not only that, but experimentation would be more regulated: channeled toward exploring the potentials of a given artistic platform—that of this particular immersive environment. This exerted pressure on artistic activity to conform to a content-providing paradigm, prelimiting the eventfulness of the process and its  participatory intensity by  reinstating a dichotomy between the artist/technological expert and the paying audience. The  site thus went from being an open proposition (the SAT as spatial-conceptual catalyzer of  action, a platform for  relation in building form) to a highstakes arena branded by its own proprietary technical system, one requiring  special access and inside knowledge. In addition, the SAT’s underlying assumption in this new phase was that artistic activity should ideally provide “deliverables” to other sectors. The SAT was facing a Faustian bargain: die an ignominious death by debt, or fall more into step with the enterprise model of the neoliberal economy. Was  it having the last  “glass,” crossing the threshold into a different relational field  than that of the exploratory community-based center it had been up to then?

It was clear that Generating the Impossible could not function within these new conditions. The  event had to remain open to its undoing. Even had we had subsidies and been in a position to pay  for access, the SATosphere would have constrained us to a preestablished site  that already presumed to know how to manage what art  can be,  and what art  can do.  The  shift the SAT was  experiencing seemed all  too reminiscent of our initial concerns about research-creation’s growing indebtedness to the capitalist economy and its enterprise model. Later, we would come back to the SAT with a project to creatively explore the tensions surrounding this shift, but we felt  we would not be prepared for this until after Generating the Impossible had carried our practices further. For now, we had to move on.

This shift came late in the process. After months of working collectively with the SATosphere in mind, those of us on the ground in Montreal liaising  with the SAT had to make a difficult call. We concluded that the event needed to reorient, and sent out a message to participants. Our proposition: drop the site.  Let the site be the city as a whole. But with a confounding  twist: let the site  be the city  as a whole—from the angle of the forest. A proposition—and a provocation.

SenseLab participants embraced the proposition and the provocation and set the process on a new eventfully self-organizing course. The  preparatory discussions on the SenseLab’s online grouphub soon settled around the concept of transduction.

As originally planned, we would start at the hunting camp at Mekoos, deep in the northern wilds 250 kilometers from Montreal. The  approach, however, would be  different than projected. Rather than starting from purposely unprepared, quasi-chaotic conditions, we would set conditions for structured improvisation in place as we had in the first three events. A number of platforms for relation would be used to catalyze the collective creative process in the forest setting toward the kind of emergent collective  attunement we had always envisioned for the event. Then we would break camp and head for the city. How could an emergent process catalyzing  in the woods be prolonged into the city? What does it mean to transduce a creative process from one set of enabling conditions to another? If the form, as well  as its content, changes in the interval of transduction, is it still  the same process? Can a forest-conditioned process renaturalize in and for  the city, in a way  that effectively brings something of the urban environment to expression, in creative relation to its ex-urban surrounds? Would that event constitute a contagion? A proliferation? A break? A variation? A tracing? Much discussion and preparation went into grappling with these issues. The  “diagram” (in  Gilles Deleuze’s sense) emerged as a pivot concept for  attempting to understand, speculative-pragmatically, what a transduction can do.

What follows is not meant in any way as a full account of the event in all its speculative-pragmatic facets. Its aim is modest: to provide a brief narrative account that gives  a summary sense of how the event took shape as it transduced its own initial sense of itself, as prospectively floated in the preceding text, into a collective wayfinding affirming its own processual autonomy in its journey from immersive dome to forest to city.

Affinity groups

In the aftermath of the event’s reorientation to its loss of a starting point, there came the necessity to find an organizational strategy conducive to nonhierarchical,  collective self-organizing that could at the same time offer  the mutual aid  that might be necessary for  life outside the city  and create the continuity that would be needed to keep the event together as it shifted from the forest back to the city.

Originally used by anarchists during the Spanish Civil War, the affinitygroup structure has  become a key organizational tool for nonhierarchical social movements, passing through the antinuclear movements of  the 1970s and 1980s, into the antiglobalization movement of the early 2000s, and most recently into the Occupy Movement of 2011. An affinity group is an autonomous decision-making unit, usually composed of five to fifteen people, networked horizontally. Its purpose is to distribute decision making transversally across a larger group without resorting to a central authority structure.

There is no central leadership, even in the representative form of elected delegates to an executive group. Interaction moves between autonomously organized small-group initiatives and assemblies of all  participants without differentiation by  rank or  function. The  purpose of the assemblies varies depending on the organizational needs, but what they have in common is that they wield no coercive, disciplinary, or even regulatory power. Their aim is not to produce conformity to a common program. The aim is to coordinate a heterogeneity of energies, transforming them, in the back-and-forth between small-group interaction and whole-group interaction, into creative synergies. The  affinity-group structure works to enhance self-organization by conducting differences into a symphony of collectively attuned initiatives, rather than reducing differences by  funneling them into a common adherence to a directive set  of principles and strategies.

As with all  SenseLab events, there was  a  daily movement between whole-group interaction and small groups. The  affinity-group structure was another exploratory technique for creating a transversality that would eclipse the tendency for “reporting”: as with other events, we were  interested less in moving content from one group to another than in creating fields  of affect that could flow between them. For Generating the Impossible, each day began with the larger group assembled together for work sessions organized around a preselected series  of philosophical readings. With the affinity groups in place, we hoped the work of the large-group events would trickle down into the rest  of the day’s  hands-on experimentation at the affinity-group level, synergizing creative thought and action into an integrated research-creation process.

Certain affinity groups formed organically in the months before we left for Mekoos. Others were  formally struck. There was one decreed enabling constraint to their activities: while at Mekoos, each affinity group would prepare one evening meal (paid for by the SenseLab) for the entire group of fifty-four Generating the Impossible participants. The organization of food provision was to be a convivial mirror of the overall organizational structure, with the shared evening meals playing the role  of informal evening assemblies. The  planning for  meals was  a complex logistical task, especially since the remoteness of  the location made it unfeasible to source food once we were  on the ground (the nearest grocery store was an hour and a half away by car over country roads, some of which become impassible  when wet). The  collective food platform involved all participants in a logistics of mutual care  that it was hoped would color the overall ethos of the encounter.

Another task of each affinity group was to develop, in the months leading  up to the event, a key concept to help trigger and orient Generating the Impossible’s self-organizing. The  concepts were  drawn from readings proposed to the whole group by individual SenseLab network participants. The readings were  discussed in regularly scheduled collective brainstorming sessions on Skype. These whole-group sessions fed into and out of discussions taking place on affinity-group-specific writeboards on the grouphub. Each  affinity group approached the preparatory concept work differently. Some immediately threw themselves into meal planning, developing their concepts and evolving group process around that activity. Others focused directly on the transductive question of how to develop a distributive creative process across sites. Others organized weekly Skype  reading groups branching off  from the main reading-focused sessions. In  the end, key concepts explored by affinity groups included tending, attention/attending, exaptation, emergence/emerging, and mapping/choreographing. All of the concepts were  developed with a view  to setting in motion the collective organization that would creatively enable the shift from the forest to the city.

A second level  of  organization was  set  up to cut  across the affinitygroup structure. Each participant was placed in a living situation at Mekoos (a cabin) mixing members from different affinity groups. This  was  done to create a framework for  informal sharing of affinity-group-based experiences and exploration. It  was  also  intended to counter any tendency for  the affinity groups to develop into in-groups identifying themselves against the group as  a whole. The  hope was  that this system of  crosssolidarities would not only facilitate concept and technique contagion, but would also produce crossovers between groups that would create the conditions for emergent constellations preventing the organizational structure from ossifying into rigid segmentations.

Food preparation has  been an important part of all  SenseLab events. For Generating the Impossible, it played an even more central role because of the convivial way it cut transversally across the levels of organization, both cabin based and affinity-group based. This transversality occurred because, practically, each evening meal had to be prepared in a given cabin. This meant that each participant would spend significant amounts of time as a guest in another cabin, and would host others in their home cabin. This created a bridge of hospitality between the cabin and the affinity-group structures. Food preparation was  complex (think only of taking allergies and other food requirements of fifty-four people into account). Each  meal comprised at least three courses, and affinity groups invested their creative energies into making them artful and generative for the event as a whole. Meals took at least a few hours to prepare (a full day for one affinity group!). This meant that people would be moving in and out of activities of different kinds, threading the food preparation into an active weave of the day. In the care and effort taken to feed the group, an event-wide hospitality could be felt  that suffused each aspect of the everyday. Hospitality, practiced in this way,  produces an ethos of care, for the event, in the event. Pounds of couscous, spaghetti squash, mangoes, and Persian rice  were  added to the arsenal of concepts, as food preparation became an avenue for experiences to be shared, ideas to be explored, and concepts to be artistically staged. Eventfully deployed, food sharing can foster emergent forms of sociality constituting qualitative alter-economies of differentially shared experience. We were  fortunate that among our participating artists was one with experience as a chef. Andrew Goodman was invaluable in the intensive role  of food consultant and meal-planning facilitator.


gifting the event

In the lead-up to the event, a great deal of thought was put into how we would collectively cross  the threshold and enter the event together in a manner consonant with—more precisely, performative of—its ethos and aims. An enabling constraint was put in place to perform the group transition into the event. In planning this constraint, we mobilized our guiding concept: the gift economy.

Each  participant was asked to bring a wrapped gift.  The  gift  was to be given to another participant, but was  not for that individual. It  was  to be a gift to the event,  through that individual. The  gift giving was an alternative to prolonged introductions. Its role  was to energize the opening of the event. Each  SenseLab event has  begun with an alternative to the ritual of self-introductions. The problem with self-introductions is just that: they are self-introductions. They bring people together based on preestablished identities (professor, student, nonacademic; maker, theorist; dancer, choreographer, media artist, philosopher) with histories of past accomplishments shoring up that identity. However gently they are proffered, they implicitly position, hierarchize, and divide. It would be  disingenuous to hold that it would be  possible—or desirable—for personal histories and individual identities to be neutralized and play no role, as if we could check them at the door. The  question is rather: what is being set in place that will qualitatively inflect the coming interactions when self-introduction is chosen as the vector of entry? In what way  does this prime the event and inflect the qualities of its interactions? How else  may the event be primed? The SenseLab’s refrain in answer to this question is that there are other ways  of coming together that are tangential to identity and professional positioning  (intersecting with them up to a point but enacting tendencies that are not reducible to them, following trajectories that exceed their limitative frame). The  idea is to find ways  of coming together that do not cement us to our preformatted ideas of what we have to bring and who we will  be for the event. Instead, we endeavor to create technique-driven encounters transversal to the identities in play (rather than in denial of or in opposition to them). SenseLab participants are  invited to bring their care, their concerns, their affinities, their passions, and most especially the techniques in which these are  performatively invested, and to enter the event along those  vectors.  Generating the  Impossible’s  inaugural gift-giving ceremony was set in place as an initial launching pad for this transversal exploration.

The  gift-giving ceremony was based on a well-known game.4 All of the wrapped gifts were  heaped in one location, unmarked as to the identity of the giver. As gifts “for the event,” they were  meant to offer  something that could potentially be activated as an affordance or platform for relation in view  of the interactions to come. This  would make each gift  an offer  of a relational angle of involvement in the event that the recipient might later activate. Participants were  invited to come up,  one by  one, and choose one gift.  The  catch was that when it was your turn, you could decide not to open a new gift,  but instead take a gift  that someone else  had already received and unwrapped. Should you take someone else’s  gift,  the gift’s original recipient would then be invited to choose a new gift.  Participants put a great deal of themselves into the gifts  they gave, knowing that they would be offered to the group anonymously. The  anonymity of the gifting  made the “personality” of the gift an occurrent character of the event, rather than an identifying marker of the source individual. The  opportunity to “steal” an already-given gift lent a ludic element to the ceremony, making the exchange itself more performative and loosening the connotation of the transfer of rightful possession that normally underwrites other practices of gift  giving. The  gift-giving ceremony set  in place a relational unwrapping across the threshold into the event that exceeded the giver– recipient duality. The gift was attached more to the collective potential that might be deployed over the coming days than to the giver or the receiver.

This  ceremony was  one aspect of the gift  economy at the basis  of the event. Over the year  previous to the event, we had set up various ways  of creating informal funding and resource-sharing structures to ensure that no participant was excluded for lack of funds.5 As with past events, we also worked with a local grocer to supply low-cost food for on-site preparation during the event.6  Montreal-based SenseLab participants offered couches and extra rooms to accommodate those who chose not to or were  unable to pay  for  hotels for  the city  segment. And  those of us with institutional backing, or with personal funds to spare, pooled our money for allocation on the basis  of need. To the extent possible, the event attempted to activate alter-economies based on mutual aid.

The  end?

Following the gift  giving and the initial tasks generated by  the affinity groups, five forest days ensued dedicated to conceiving creative propositions that could be transduced to the city. As mentioned, each morning was

set aside for the concept work assemblies involving close collective readings of a selection of philosophical texts, using a variety of techniques including what has  become the SenseLab’s signature technique of conceptual speed dating (as discussed previously). Afternoons were focused on affinity-group work sessions on site-conditioned projects bringing something of the forest surroundings or camp environment to creative expression, always with a view  to their added potential for generating transductive bridges between Mekoos and Montreal.

The largest and most visible proposition was the construction of a work “for  the forest” that came to be called The  Mi(d)st: a 100-meter length of repurposed mosquito netting that was  painstakingly stretched across an arm of the lake  on the far end from camp. The  Mi(d)st  grew  from a stray comment from one participant about the captivating ephemerality of the morning and evening mist that rose from the lake, crossed with a platform for relation donated by Nathaniel Stern, who offered his  rope-based “Sentimental Construction” concept to the group as a proposition for  collective  improvisation.7 The  Mi(d)st  “caught” the captivating mist in its  net. It also  reflected its own form in the water, creating a play across surfaces that visually expressed the interpenetration of processes the event sought to produce on other levels. Alan  Prohm also gifted a proposition for group reappropriation  growing from his  “loom” projects, which are  similarly rope based. The Tubular Loom is strung, not unlike a spider web for people, between site-specific structures (in  our case,  two trees). Once mounted, it serves as an invitation to ungrounded movement as participants run, crawl, or sidle through it, experiencing altered proprioceptive states.

Many other propositions were  generated on site  from affinity-group activities. Some took an installation form; others were  processual unfoldings  exploring “diagrammatic” relations. Projects spawned other projects, including a sound and image performance for/on the lake that saw itself as a prolongation of The Mi(d)st  by other means. One affinity group made it their task to “tend” the process in its globality, insinuating themselves into other affinity groups’ interactions in subtle ways  intended to help leaven their creative initiatives, perhaps without the beneficiaries of this processual intercession even being aware of it. Unfortunately, the space is lacking here to go into the full richness of these explorations.

As our time in the forest was drawing to a close, so too was the Technologies of Lived Abstraction event series. Generating the Impossible was meant to be the final event in the series. The SenseLab has  never differentiated itself from its activities. Its mode of existence is entirely project based. It never saw itself as an organization with a claim to existence separate from what it does. It  never aspired to become a self-preserving or  self-reproducing institution within which or  in the name of which activities took place. It takes its own dedication to the emergent and the ephemeral seriously: it would continue to operate as long as its projects propelled themselves, preferring to die  rather than to ossify. The  end of  the event series  thus raised the inevitable question: had the SenseLab lived itself out? Had it performed, to the best of its ability, its function of consolidating new ways  of coming together around research-creation techniques to create relational environments? Did the mode of collective relational existence that was the SenseLab still  have a reason for being? 

Accordingly, on day  five, SenseLab founder and pivot person Erin  Manning rather abruptly announced that the SenseLab was no more. The  declaration of its passing was a performative  proposition posing a series  of unsaid questions to the collective. Shall we as a group resuscitate the SenseLab? If so, with what continuities and what transformations? Is the energy and momentum there to justify its continuance on processual grounds? Do we proceed from here? Have we done our work, or is there still  work to do?  Or: have we done our work so well  that we risk  becoming the institution we never wanted? How do  we proceed from here? Reinvent or perish.

It is part of the SenseLab’s basically anarchist inspiration to consider that no grouping should endeavor to exist indefinitely, institutionalizing itself around its  own desire for  self-perpetuation. At the same time, we realize that no organization will ever  be able  to completely resist or forego institutionalization. Manning was asking the group whether we had now reached the end of  the road, or  whether the SenseLab was  on the road to becoming an institution in spite of itself. After  a moment of shocked silence, the answer came as a resounding no. There was still  work remaining  to be done and a collective desire to embark upon it. Yet the question did  stage a performative shift: saying no to the question was tantamount to affirming a collective responsibility for where the SenseLab would move next. The eventual form this desire took was the next SenseLab event, Into the Midst (play on The Mi(d)st  intended), which brought us back to the SAT more than a year  later in October 2012. Into the Midst  was  to prove to be the most integrally self-organizing SenseLab event thus far.9  The  real  gift to the event was the investment participants made to continue “generating  the impossible.”

Tending and Tentativeness

Generating the impossible is no humble proposition, but Generating the Impossible was  a humble event. Faced with the grandness of the proposition, we endeavored collectively to develop new ways  of working together across two distant and heterogeneous sites. Our hope was to touch on how creative practices, and how art  and politics, can co-compose in researchcreation. Many of the event’s undertakings were  tentative, and remained germinal. We  had a few  solid starting points: the readings, a year  of collective thinking, the Sentimental Construction and Tubular Loom propositions, the gift-giving passage across the threshold. But  still, to come up with a strong artwork, articulated with emergent conceptual intensities,  within five days is a mammoth task  by any standard. To do  so with people who in some cases  you are meeting in person for the first time is a challenge. We worked hard, in and across our affinity groups, taking joy in little emergences, and keeping in mind that germinality itself, rather than a finished product, was the goal:  that the product was process. As always for SenseLab events, the measure of success would be the intensity of the next event this one seeded, as well  as the creative partnerships formed through SenseLab participation spinning off into extra-SenseLab collaborations. Success for  the SenseLab is centrifugal: the seeding of processual spin-offs. The  truest measure of  the SenseLab’s success are  successes for which it cannot claim credit.

The   ethos of  tending and tentativeness moved with us  when we departed Mekoos for Montreal. By now, a strong sense of concern for the event had developed. With it came a panoply of germinating propositions for the city  segment. As with earlier SenseLab events, a mode of decision making had set itself in motion that was not based on a central authority or representational delegation, nor on what is commonly considered the only alternative to these: consensus. Decisions were  self-making, based on the singular force of each proposition. Anything that seemed worth trying—in other words, anything with sufficient processual allure—would tend to be explored. Yet only the strongest (most collectively potentiating) of the many seeded initiatives would carry themselves into action, on their own self-expressive steam. This autonomizing of decision rarely caused friction: there is no end to potential ideas, and those not explored during Generating the Impossible were  understood as seeds storing potential for future events that might germinate elsewhere at another time. It was this autonomizing of decision that carried through the next event, Into the Midst.

An endeavor is at its most inventive when decision making works as a cut  in a process that enables new forms of collectivity to emerge in a next unfolding phase. For this to work well  it is necessary that actions embody a “concern for  the event,” and that an atmosphere and ethos has  been generated that sustains that concern. Much work must go into enabling the event to do  its own work, such that it is the global momentum of the event  itself  that is followed and fed.  This  momentum may at times channel  through an act  or decision of a particular individual or subgroup. But it is not owned by them. It channels through them, such that no one in particular can take ultimate credit for anything that happens. In the end, it is only the event that is a credit to itself. exploding the city?

Many thresholds were crossed, tendingly, tentatively, into the forest, around camp, and from the forest back to the city. But  no explosion occurred— more like  a scattering into the urban fabric. When the group descended upon Montreal, a number of concurrent happenings unfolded. Some took the form of choreographic explorations of the city’s  movements. A subgroup set about working on an urban iteration of the Mekoos-made version of the tubular loom, re-sited to a vacant lot.  Another scouted locations to set up urban reemplacements of The Mi(d)st.

On our first evening back, The Mi(d)st was restrung in Saint-Viateur Park in Outremont across a small moat separating the perimeter of  the park from an island pavilion at its center. A security guard cooperatively turned a blind eye  while the netting was  installed and then came back later to “discover” the deed and fulfill his  duty to uphold city  permit regulations.

The next day, we decided to hang it in a less patrolled location: the back alley between two streets in Outremont. This was made possible by the fact that two of us lived on the same alley and so we could string the lengthy work from one third-floor balcony to another. A number of participants spent the afternoon stringing. A few  remained to gauge reactions while others went off to participate in other evening activities, including a tie-in event hosted by Artivistic, a sister organization of the SenseLab. The  plan was to meet back at the alley to celebrate the hanging of the work. Before we met back, however, word was  sent out by  the members of the group tending the work that a number of police cars had swooped into the alley and surrounded The Mi(d)st  while a large  group of Hasidic Jews from the surrounding neighborhood looked on, concerned because they had been wrongly blamed for the offense. It turned out that the police had received calls  from certain people living in houses that backed onto that alley who were  enraged by what they took to be a religious takeover of secular space. They had fantasized the humble Mekoos mosquito netting into an eruv: a structure used to symbolically transform a segment of the public domain into an extension of  the private domain, thus enabling Orthodox Jews who strictly observe the dictates of Shabbat to move more freely on that day. Certain Montreal Hasidic communities practice a minimalist version of the eruv consisting of wires strung so high between buildings as to be all but invisible, in an attempt to avoid friction with defenders of Quebec’s deeply ingrained secular order (not to mention its  historically ingrained anti-Semitic elements, present as a small but vocal minority in Outremont). The Mi(d)st  was mistaken for an imperialist act  on the part of the Hasidic community aimed at widening their religious kingdom to include this nondescript alley. This  hateful misunderstanding reminded us that a “transduction” is site-conditioned on both sides. The  results can never be fully anticipated. Whatever is crystallized comes from a set of tensions or forces that are catalyzed into taking emergent expression. Although residents of Outremont live in relative peace across religious communities and between religious and secular orders, there are always latent tensions. In this Montreal iteration, The Mi(d)st  reflected the troubled waters of these latent tensions, bringing them to an unintended, siren-screaming expression.

Another of  the Montreal propositions that stood out also  produced unintended effects of a more convivial kind. One affinity group decided to meet downtown at a local bus stop and ride  the bus down its whole line while reading aloud A User’s Guide to (Demanding) the Impossible, one of the books featured in our preparatory concept work for Generating the Impossible (available freely online). Affinity-group participants boarded the bus  early on a Sunday morning at the first stop on its line and sat at the back. Passing  the book from one person to another, they staged a mobile recitation and reading group. They had not known what to expect in terms of public reaction. At one point, an earphoned teenager boarded the bus  and sat, at first  unawares, among the readers. When it came time for the book to be passed, it fell to him. Despite the surprise, he took off his  earphones and joined in. He was the first of many. The  bus  driver also  became intrigued, becoming so engaged in the action that, after reaching the end of the line, he drove the bus off its route to drop the Impossiblers off at the vacant lot where we were  all meeting at the end of the day  for a final urban potluck.

The rise of the Free radical

If Generating the Impossible as a whole succeeded in making the threshold of an alter-economy of creative relation palpable, its most far-ranging, and free-ranging, technique in this respect was the free radical.

The  free  radical was  embodied for  this event by  one member of  the collective, Australian artist Paul  Gazzola. While the free radical’s ultimate role  was  to disentangle itself from individual embodiment and proliferate,  for this first experimentation with the concept, we needed to give the free  radical a presence and operational form, and Paul  was it. But he was not it alone for long. Even before we reached Mekoos, the free radical had radicalized itself through an unexpected multiplication. Suddenly, as if by spontaneous generation, there were  two, or more. Paul  was multiplied by self-appointed free  radicals going by the monikers “Frank” and “FRank.” Or  was  Paul  the F®anks? Nobody seemed to know. The  identity of  the F®anks was unknown, their position uncertain, and their role evolving over a number of online sallies. All anyone knew for sure  was that the operator of  the free  radical had ostensibly proliferated in its  anonymous enthusiasm to play its  assigned role  of “breaking down emergent attunement after it has  just emerged, but before it can stabilize into a self-sustaining harmony that might assert itself as a model.” From the very  outset, then, the figure of the free  radical spontaneously took off  from Paul’s  (or  is it FRank’s  or Frank’s?) embodiment of it, all the better to work as a transversal force for unsettling the collective attunement in the making, preventing it from institutionalizing into a self-perpetuating structure.

This  trickstering of the trickster figure made the free radical a looming, unidentifiable presence. Since no one knew who or how many it was,  its interventions were  not necessarily discernible. This  meant that at each stage of the event we were  obliged to be on the lookout for  occurrences that might be laid  to free-radical intercession. How the free radical might be operative in the alter-economy we were  creating was an ongoing, open question. Through its perhaps spectral multiplication, the free radical came to embody the event’s outside. It became the ubiquitous figure of an intervening outside force of unsettlement that could not be definitively pinned on any one individual or identifiable group of individuals within the larger group. This  apparition of the outside among us worked to remind us that there was no absolute “inside” to the event. Its own transductive figure was of the inside folding out, from Mekoos to the city  and beyond.

The  SenseLab does not exist “as  such.” It is not an organization. It is not an institution. It is not a collective identity. It is an event-generating machine, a processual field of research-creation whose mission is to inside itself out. Its job is to generate outside prolongations of its activity that ripple into distant pools of potential. Ripple-effect: one idea becomes a seed for organization, which becomes a proposition for a concept, which becomes a problem for art,  for politics, for philosophy, that may, if the conditions are  ripe, resolve itself into the triggering of an event of collective experimentation and creative expression. This  event potential is (dis)embodied in the trickstered-trickster figure of the free  radical, gone spectral. When the conditions have been right and the event has  been generated, it has always come into itself in a relation with its radical outside—which it paradoxically generates flush with its own occurring, also immediately in relation to distant events beyond itself.


The  Adventures of White

The status of white in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s color theory closely parallels its  relational operation across Ettinger’s painting series. Goethe defined white as “the fortuitously opaque flash of a pure transparency” (1970, §495, 204).8 Translucid matter; or, pure light. “Light no longer has to do with darkness, but with the transparent, the translucid, and the white” (Deleuze 1986,  93).

The  color field, for Goethe, emerges as an accident befalling transparency: it is a fortuitous becoming, emerging by degrees in a process of continuing variation. “Between transparency and the opacity of white there exists an infinite number of degrees of cloudiness” (Deleuze 1986, 93). The oppositions between light and dark, white and black, and even illumination and hue, which in traditional color theory are  taken to prestructure the field  of vision, by this account emerge processually from a formative accident of transparency: its departing from itself in a flash, into its own cloudying. Transparency thickens, clouding. The clouding “accumulates.” The accumulating attains white as its “extreme degree” (Goethe 1970, §146–47, 60–61; §494, 204).

For Goethe, the color field  is a qualitative continuum composed of an infinity of variations, contingently unfolding. A continuum of qualitative variation is best designated by its extreme degree, because it is the extreme degree as pole of attraction that orients the moving continuously through. The  continuum of vision is the continuity of white’s tending toward its own emergence from transparency. Transparency is the degree zero  of vision: pure visibility, itself unseeable, containing nothing but the power of the continuum opaquely departing from it. The  entire continuum can be seen, from the perspective of its last  degree of white, as the continuum of white: the continuum of white’s diverse flashes of opacity self-relating, yielding fortuitous degrees of cloudiness in endless variation, across different unfolding series.

Color itself is an emergence falling on this continuum. For  Goethe, color does not emerge from darkness when light is cast  upon a space to illuminate its  contents. Color emerges from colored shadow: from a certain clouded self-relating of light. “Color itself . . . is lumen opacatum [opacified  light]” (Goethe 1970,  §69,  31). “For  Goethe, all  colors are shadows” (Sorensen 2008, 161).

Space  itself does not preexist as  the container for  contents awaiting

illumination. The accumulation of transparency that is white is also “the simplest, brightest, first, opaque occupation of space” (Goethe 1970, §147: 61). Space  is an emergence, also  on the continuum. It emerges in the course of white’s formative self-relating. Next come forms. Light is not shed on preexisting forms. Figures emerge from the shadows variegating the color field. They do not emerge from the shadows in the sense of appearing for what they already are  when shadow is dissipated by a shedding of light. Figures form between regions of shadow. Their contours take at the boundary  between different degrees of clouding. They are  the liminal relation between regions of the formative field, seen as such. They are  relational beings of light—of transparency, translucency, and whiteness—with their own degree of luminous quality. “Between the white of the veil  and the white of the background, the face  holds itself up like  a fish” in the turbulent sea of white and color becoming. This  figure “can lose  its outline in giving way  to a soft  focus . . . without losing anything of its reflecting power” (Deleuze 1986, 93). It can drift, without losing its powers of reflecting, its powers of relation.

It is not about “a struggle between light and dark, but light’s adventure with white: . . . anti-Expressionism” (Deleuze 1986,  94).

It is certain that all bodies whatsoever, though they have no sense, yet they have perception . . . and whether a body be alterant or altered, evermore a perception precedeth operation; for else all bodies would be alike to one another.
—­Francis­ Bacon (in Whitehead 1967b,  68–69)

Taking Account

“There is an apportioning out that can register and an apportioning out that happens more indeterminately” (Arakawa and Gins 2002, 5).1  The apportioning out that can register is sense,  meaning “cognition: apprehension.” The  apportioning out that happens more indeterminately is a perception preceding cognitive operation. Apprehension without the “ap-” and with the emphasis on the new first  syllable: prehension. It all begins with an uncognitive  taking account of  an as-yet-indeterminate apportioning out (Whitehead 1967b,  69). Difference is founded upon this preoperation (“else all bodies would be alike”). A body comes into its own already finding itself in a difference-making taking-account. As yet  it can have no sense whether it is alterant or altered. “Half-abstracted from the start” (AG 2002, 51). And  yet  it is already in the process of  landing. In an “underlying activity of realization individualizing itself” (Whitehead 1967b,  70).


Modal location

Perhaps it is simply too early to make a concrete distinction between alterant and altered, affecting and affected-by. For the underlying activity is a push that pulls. The  body is pushed into a taking-account already in process, and this pulls it toward a self-individualizing realization. Not yet one or the other, agent or patient, the body is finding itself in an undisentangleable “interlocking of modes” (Whitehead 1967b,  70).  

Bare activity

Every  site  is a prehensive interlocking of reciprocal modes in bare activity.  There is no “simple location” (Whitehead 1967b,  69–71).  The  smile spreads over the face, as the face fits itself onto the smile (Whitehead 1967b, 71). The  couch fits  itself to the body, as the body spreads itself over the couch. The  fit  is already apportioning this double potential the instant the couch is perceived, even at an uncomfortable distance. In the underlying  activity of every perception, there is one two-way movement of reciprocal interfusion already incipiently, actively taking account. “Our body penetrates the sofa  on which it sits;  and the sofa  penetrates our body” (Boccioni 1970,  28).  “What emanates from bodies and what emanates from architectural surrounds intermix” (AG 2002, 61). A modal location is a field of experience.

Agency and Patience

Body  and sofa “take hold and hold forth” (AG 2002, 9). To take hold is to show agency. To hold oneself forth for what will come is to show patience. The landing site’s prehension interfuses agency and patience, indissolubly alterant-altering. “Distinguishing between subject and object should be avoided” (AG 2002, 49).

Beyond simple location

“That which is being apportioned out is in the process of landing” (AG
2002, 5). The  site is in the process of apportioning itself out as the body is apportioning itself to it. The  site  lands itself for the body as much as the body lands the site.  The  site stretches between in a single, two-way movement of potential. Do not presume to know concretely where the person who makes architectural-body sense lies. She lies in the field of her potential. “We  cannot define where a body begins and where external nature ends” (Whitehead 1968,  21).


Potential is the stream

Potential is the stream one can enter twice. But  “no two moments have identical streams in which to rest  a weary foot.” Reciprocally, “no two moments offer  up an identical foot.” “Nothing stays in place as place but flux” (AG 2002, 4).

Fielding Potential

“Landing sites abound within landing sites” (AG 2002, 9). The architectural surround is a crisscross field of many streams. A field of nested abundance. It does not begin with a form. It does not begin with a figure–background configuration. It begins as a populated field of alterant-altering interfusion. Agencies-patiencies abound for the apportioning. For anything in particular to happen, a particular expanse must be taken: “The taking of a particular expanse to be a landing site happens in a flash” (AG 2002, 9). Having been taken  to be, the landing site  now is. To be is to be had in a flash.

Pulses of Persons

To be is to be had in a flash. “These events are decision-like” (AG 2002, 9). A portion of field potential has been had. The sofa’s holding forth has been taken hold of. Its perceptual activity disappears in the taking of comfort. Seated comfort stands out from the background. It takes the foreground, where it will figure as being the experience. The field is now configured. Its event has  taken form. The  sofa  rests  in the background, patient provider of plush. Agent and patient have separated out. Subject and object. Person and thing. The architectural body has  fielded its potential into personable form. This happens in a flash and “is over in a flash.” No sooner is the form taking decided than it “yields to whatever can come next” (AG 2002, 9). Back into the stream. Taking, yielding; figuring, backgrounding; potential resolved, potential returned; taking place and staying in flux.  Personing pulses with field potential. At each pulse it draws the field’s abundance into a unifying standpoint. That standpoint expresses a decision-like event in the currency of affect: comfort. An affective value is a selective expression. It is a qualitative translation of a modal location.

Taking Place

The  taking form of decision-like events is a taking place. A position is the standpoint the affective translation of  a modal location sits  itself into, assigns itself as a site.  But  “assigned positions quickly lose  ground: one moment’s nearground slips  into the next’s farground” (AG 2002, 71).

consciousness Flickers

In the pulsing of the person, “consciousness flickers; and even at its brightest, there is a small focal region of clear illumination, and a large penumbral region of experience which tells of intense experience in dim apprehension. The  simplicity of clear consciousness is no measure of the complexity of complete experience” (Whitehead 1978, 267).

rhythm, history, life

“There is a rhythm of process whereby creation produces natural pulsation, each pulsation forming a natural unit of historic fact.” These “transitions of history exhibit forms of order.” “The essence of life,” however, “is to be found in the frustrations of established order.” Life’s “aim is at novelty of order” (Whitehead 1968,  88). Does  taking comfort qualify as life?  Only if it flickers. Is taking comfort death? Yes, if it stays in place.

A Perspective of the universe

“The things which are  grasped into a realized unity, here and now, are not the castle, the cloud, the planet, [and the sofa] in themselves; but they are the castle, the cloud, the planet [and the sofa]  from the standpoint of the prehensive [affective] unification. In other words, it is the standpoint of the [sofa]  over there from the standpoint of the unification here. It is, therefore, aspects of the castle, the cloud, the planet [and the sofa]  which are grasped into unity here” (Whitehead 1967b,  70). This  is a perspective. But it is not a perspective on a portion of the universe. It is a “perspective of the universe” (Whitehead 1968, 66, 79, 89). Each  realization figures itself out against the background of its own unification, but that figuring holds its unity in simultaneous contrast with an endless abundance of potentialities of alternate realizations (Whitehead 1968, 91). Its foregrounding of itself configures itself to them. It figures with  them, implicitly. Each  decision-like event comes into its own individuality with  an infinity of alternate forms.3 “It expresses its own nature as being this, and not that . . . combined with the sense of modes of infinitude stretching beyond its own limitations.” In this sense, it implicitly “expresses its necessary relevance beyond its own limitations. It expresses a perspective of the universe” (Whitehead 1968, 108).  Its standpoint is a region of the world’s potential, flickeringly taking place. It tells  of intense experience nested in the larger penumbral region of dimmer experience. It is a perspective of experience, in the same sense in which it is a perspective of the universe. The world is landing sites within landing sites;  regions of experience within larger experience. The  world is the larger of the experiences. It is of experience, for  larger or  for  smaller. Every  experience is a worlding. To land is to world.
